    <title>Verizon’s Smart Display is real and it’s just as pointless as we suspected</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2IZO507inYUFf5uJ1_7AS9-1OwI=/236x0:2600x1576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618624/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.04.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t appear that Verizon’s Smart Assistant can do a whole lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEtNSY"&gt;We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22552037/fcc-filing-shows-verizon-amazon-alexa-smart-display"&gt;first look at Verizon’s Smart Display&lt;/a&gt; last month thanks to an FCC filing. Yesterday, Amazon confirmed the device’s existence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;as part of its Alexa Live presentation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s being introduced as part of the Alexa Custom Assistant program that allows third-party device manufacturers to add custom assistants built on top of Alexa technology to their products, and we regret to inform you that it looks just as useless as we first suspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpVTyh"&gt;Here’s what it offers: standard smart display stuff, like an eight-inch screen, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connectivity, and of course, Alexa. It also comes with LTE, a spec included in the FCC filing and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/verizons-smart-display-is-real-and-responds-to-hi-verizon/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following the announcement. But the purpose of 4G appears to be limited to providing connectivity while setting up or troubleshooting Verizon home internet. Amazon says this will reduce the need to “send service technicians to a customer’s house or have a customer call the Verizon Call Center for help.” So that’s kind of a narrow use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RU8gvM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4v4o9L6A2M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo4LJA"&gt;There are also Verizon-service-specific commands that can be accessed by saying “Hi, Verizon,” like checking your bill or running a speed test. You know, things you can easily do on your phone or computer. You can ask Verizon smart assistant-type questions, like the current weather, but based on a promotional video published by Amazon it looks like Verizon will... just ask Alexa for you. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HavCIk"&gt;If you ever thought to yourself, “Self, wouldn’t it be great to have a way to check my phone bill hands-free while I eat a sandwich in the kitchen?” then maybe you’ve just found your match. Otherwise, this doesn’t exactly look like the smartest of smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgAwlr"&gt;Verizon hasn’t revealed a price or firm release date yet; &lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports that the display will be available later this year in limited beta testing with Verizon home internet customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Alexa’s voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqRqfU6nShSHNhS_wMFHxrpeMUY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618606/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="smV0Gv"&gt;Alexa’s pleasant, feminine voice has filled the homes of millions over the past few years, but now Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587130/alexa-masculine-voice-gender-ziggy-amazon-smart-assistant"&gt;finally released a masculine counterpart&lt;/a&gt; for it. Amazon is late to this — both Apple and Google have offered different voices, both feminine and masculine, in their virtual assistants for years. But late or not, it’s nice that Amazon is finally giving some choice for Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dHMIa"&gt;In addition to the two main Alexa voices, Amazon also has celebrity voices (right now you can choose between Samuel L. Jackson, Shaquille O’Neal, and Melissa McCarthy). These are programmed to work with certain phrases and answer select questions — mostly alarms and timers, jokes, or weather reports. They also cost $5 each. Any query to an Echo device that’s not supported by the chosen celebrity voice will get a response from the native Alexa voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mrqlcy"&gt;There are two ways you can change the voice of Alexa on your Echo devices: through the device itself or through the Alexa app. Note that changing the voice through the device was less reliable for us — the surest way to do it is through the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LC3tSb"&gt;Changing the voice only applies to the Echo device you’re currently using — if you want to switch to the masculine voice on multiple Echo speakers or displays in your home, you’ll have to do it one at a time. It’s also not possible to change the Alexa voice used by the smartphone app itself; that remains the original, feminine voice. Hopefully, in the future Amazon will add a way to change it globally for all the Echo devices on an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wWccGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo (2020) review: music of the sphere","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"},{"title":"Amazon Echo Dot (2020) review: have a ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"},{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 8 is a little faster and has a better camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iTE0VW"&gt;Without further ado, here’s how to change Alexa’s voice on an Echo device:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QAvHZy"&gt;On an Echo or Echo Show:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="14vObd"&gt;Say the command “Alexa change your voice.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yj0Gnb"&gt;If you have more than one Echo, Alexa will ask you to specify the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mNplo0"&gt;Say the name of the device you want to change the voice on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EiRUXk"&gt;If it is successful, Alexa will respond with the new voice and confirm that is how it will sound going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0aQ6zv"&gt;If it doesn’t work, Alexa will say something to the effect of “Sorry, [name of your device] doesn’t support that.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HlxiII"&gt;In the Alexa app for iOS or Android:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MxX9JB"&gt;Tap on the Devices tab at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S7MVHt"&gt;Tap on the Echo &amp;amp; Alexa button in the top left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8pVlO3"&gt;Tap on the device you want to change Alexa’s voice on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xYEVsY"&gt;Tap the Settings cog wheel button in the upper right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GqPe60"&gt;Scroll down to the option for Alexa’s Voice and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eywvL0"&gt;Choose either Original (the feminine voice) or New (the masculine voice).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="aVZBhn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10664550"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QYUOpG"&gt;How to use a celebrity voice:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="22SrTg"&gt;Say “Alexa introduce me to [name of celebrity].” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6FshSw"&gt;Alexa will switch over to the celeb voice you’ve selected and explain the things you can do with it. If you want to purchase the voice, you will be asked to confirm the charge to your Amazon account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MGZoyk"&gt;Once enabled, you can say “Hey [celeb name]” to wake the Echo device. You can also enable the voice on each Echo you want to use it on. The standard Alexa voice is still available if you use the Alexa wake word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Facebook content moderators call for company to put an end to overly restrictive NDAs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_sqitF-hgnhDwuvQZDGqn9qqME=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618525/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fDX4vq"&gt;Facebook content moderators in Europe and the US are calling on the company to put an end to overly restrictive nondisclosure agreements that discourage people from speaking out about working conditions. In &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WB3wyFy5wWB89JYDbHO52ceEZoCTrkkx6Zy8orZ2D1o/viewform?edit_requested=true"&gt;a letter addressed to Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, Sheryl Sandberg, and the CEOs of Covalen and Accenture, moderators say these NDAs aren’t limited to user data and help perpetuate a culture of “excessive secrecy.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi0kl8"&gt;“Despite the company’s best efforts to keep us quiet, we write to demand the company’s culture of fear and excessive secrecy ends today,” the moderators write. “No NDA can lawfully prevent us from speaking out about our working conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5xgMQ"&gt;The news comes amid escalating tension between the company and its contract content moderators in Ireland. In May, a moderator named Isabella Plunkett testified before a parliamentary committee to try to push for legislative change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSOmtv"&gt;“The content that is moderated is awful,” she said. “It would affect anyone ... To help, they offer us wellness coaches. These people mean really well, but they are not doctors. They suggest karaoke and painting, but frankly, one does not always feel like singing, after having seen someone be battered to bits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoMhFt"&gt;The letter asks that the company give moderators regular access to clinical psychiatrists and psychologists. “Imagine watching hours of violent content or children abuse online as part of your day to day work,” they write. “You cannot be left unscathed. This job must not cost us our mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErIrud"&gt;Moderators also want to be brought in-house, saying the current system makes them second-class citizens. They’re calling on the company to give them the same pay and benefits as full-time Facebook moderators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7YKeE"&gt;The letter currently has 60 signatures from moderators in Dublin, Lisbon, and Barcelona — as well as parts of the US. It was written in collaboration with Foxglove, a UK nonprofit focused on tech justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tekNt4"&gt;“Facebook content moderators worldwide work grueling shifts wading through a never-ending flood of the worst material on the internet,” wrote Foxglove director Martha Dark in a statement. “Yet, moderators don’t get proper, meaningful, clinical long term mental health support, they have to sign highly restrictive NDAs to keep them quiet about what they’ve seen and the vast majority of the workforce are employed through outsourcing companies where they don’t receive anywhere near the same support and benefits Facebook gives its own staff.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNVcUd"&gt;In a statement, Facebook pushed back against the idea that moderators don’t have access to mental health care. “We recognize that reviewing content can be a difficult job, which is why we work with partners who support their employees through training and psychological support when working with challenging content,” a spokesperson said. “In Ireland, this includes 24/7 on-site support with trained practitioners, an on-call service, and access to private healthcare from the first day of employment. We also use technology to limit their exposure to graphic material as much as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaXaL7"&gt;Neither Accenture nor Covalen provided a statement prior to publication. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA exec on how the pandemic changed development: ‘I don’t think we will ever go back’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Collision 2019 - Day Three" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lnK3ykNyI1d9OiFdmJ76WOWN2qc=/0x24:4910x3297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618489/1145669613.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lpINoR"&gt;Today, Electronic Arts announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350940"&gt;a handful of new projects&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350881"&gt;a remake of &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a story-driven racer complete with Hollywood talent. It’s part of what feels like a busy period for the publisher; last year, EA says it launched 13 new games and more than 400 updates for existing titles. That productivity is especially notable given that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222465/coronavirus-game-developers-work-from-home-bungie-riot"&gt;like most companies around the world&lt;/a&gt;, EA’s studios were forced to work remotely due to the pandemic. Laura Miele, EA’s chief studios officer, says the publisher is still learning how to best make games remotely. And while it’s not clear what the future of EA’s studios will look like, there will be change moving forward. “I don’t think we will ever go back to how we were before the pandemic,” Miele tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4E2cqI"&gt;Miele oversees 25 different studios — including recent additions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173732/ea-codemasters-buyout-agreed-price-need-for-speed-dirt"&gt;Codemasters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;Glu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile"&gt;Playdemic&lt;/a&gt; — and initially, she says, the biggest hurdle for remote work was “pure production,” meaning the nuts and bolts of developing a game. That’s also the place where she believes the publisher has made the most progress. “In the beginning of the pandemic, we were experiencing a certain level of production hit that we’re actually making up progress on over the past year,” she says, noting that teams have developed internal tools, as well as techniques like always-on Zoom warrooms, to get around some of the logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znvkZZ"&gt;“We’ve learned the production mechanics and some technology solves. I think we’re still learning about the human factor and how people are impacted on an emotional and human level,” she adds. It’s an issue that came to light last year when &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Respawn &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-pandemi-1844497825"&gt;responded to complaints of its pandemic work schedule&lt;/a&gt;, particularly when it came to maintaining a healthy work / life balance while dealing with the demanding nature of a live service game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JyMzOG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You do lose some creative energy and connection when you kick a new project off.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RC8rFb"&gt;Dealing with these issues appears to have been helped in part by EA’s scale. Modern blockbuster games are typically built by multiple teams, and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; is no exception. While DICE is leading development from Stockholm, LA-based Ripple Effect is handling the newly announced &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; Portal mode. Meanwhile, Criterion Games — a studio previously best-known for the&lt;em&gt; Burnout&lt;/em&gt; series, which has since become something of a stringer for EA — came aboard later in development to help out. “Criterion came on to the project at the beginning of this year,” Miele says. “They know [the Frostbite game engine] well, they’re incredibly seasoned production talent, and so they came on and really helped the team with working from home and the logistics of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOCoIM"&gt;Arguably more challenging than production problems has been kindling the creative spark of artists and designers. This has been less of a challenge for games that were already well underway when the pandemic hit, but developing brand-new ideas remotely has proven tricky. “You do lose some creative energy and connection when you kick a new project off, that initial incubation / creativity phase,” says Miele. “We’re losing some connection there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMj44r"&gt;It’s not clear yet what the long-term effects will be on EA and its many studios. Miele says she’s particularly interested in seeing how things develop over the coming months as many countries ease restrictions, and offices start to open in a limited capacity — though she stops short of outlining any specific changes with regards to remote work moving forward. “We’re going to learn in this next phase, and that will really inform how we think about perhaps a more hybrid model as we go back,” she says. “I think it’s too premature to make a big declaration about ‘We’re going to be doing &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.’ I want us to continue to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements from EA Play Live 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBvlg13eJs36KsZHMyiKwAhhqiM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618443/KIN_Portal_Screenshot_02_ElAlamein_1920x1080_NoLogo_36533960f60d011d03e2.08465894.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield Portal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Kq1Lh"&gt;At EA Play Live, the game publisher spent around an hour detailing the future of some of its biggest franchises. And while much of the news was to be expected, a few surprises snuck in — including an all-too-brief tease of a return to a horror favorite. If you missed the show, here are the most notable things EA revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4LZE15"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5WeBNfX-og?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BVOSei"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350881"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; is getting a next-gen remake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud9wjR"&gt;The best was saved for last, with a quick tease of a full-on remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;, which promises to update the survival horror classic for modern hardware. There isn’t much to go on just yet — it doesn’t even have a release date — but the new version of &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; will launch on the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="923tAn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4qWMcQfOCc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G3igtj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351708"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; is getting a creative mode of sorts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lQoIpc"&gt;One of the bigger surprises was the reveal of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; Portal, a mode for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s built around user-generated content. The mode will feature all seven maps from the base &lt;em&gt;2042&lt;/em&gt; game, along with six maps from classic &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; titles, which can then be remixed by customizing modes, settings, along with weapons, soldiers, and other content pulled from multiple era-spanning &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; games: &lt;em&gt;2042, 1942, Bad Company 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BF3.&lt;/em&gt; There’s even a logic editor (though EA says you won’t be able to edit the maps), and user creations can then be uploaded so others can play them, too. Portal will launch alongside &lt;em&gt;2042&lt;/em&gt; on October 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="XNdL2D"&gt;A beautiful new &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; cinematic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="leLCpi"&gt;Developer Respawn previously teased the next &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;character, Seer, but now we have a really good look at him, thanks to this gorgeous cinematic that has me pining for an &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt; animated movie. You’ll be able to learn more about how he actually plays when the first gameplay trailer drops on July 26th. Seer will be part of the game’s next major update, called Emergence, which will launch on August 3rd. And for esports fans, the second season of the &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; Pro League is slated to start in September, with a prize pool of $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="YoaWd7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; is getting a new season&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vv3MyH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453234/knockout-city-dodgeball-ea-velan-studios"&gt;Multiplayer dodgeball game &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is getting a big update, when a film-inspired second season called “Fight at the Movies” kicks off on July 27th. Most notably, the update will add a new map that takes place across what looks like a wide range of faux-Hollywood sets, and which the developer describes as “ever-changing movie-inspired arenas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cuke5R"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3-BJfhnlWY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZZ8Voe"&gt;

Players will also be able to create custom races that mix and match vehicle types; so you can have an open-wheeled racecar going up against a truck if you want. The game is slated to launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators target Section 230 to fight COVID-19 vaccine misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDFb8LhY047KPxEKj5242YOkQdw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618408/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXG65Z"&gt;As coronavirus cases rise in unvaccinated populations, Democratic senators are introducing a new bill Thursday that would strip away Facebook and other social media platforms’ Section 230 liability shield if they amplify harmful public health misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOYsB5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733658/EHF21778.pdf"&gt;The Health Misinformation Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) Thursday, would create a carveout in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act opening social media platforms like Facebook up to lawsuits for hosting some dangerous health misinformation. The bill directs the Health and Human Services secretary to issue guidelines on what should be classified as “health misinformation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRedun"&gt;The carveout would only apply in situations where online misinformation is related to an existing public health emergency like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, as declared by the HHS secretary. It would only open a platform up to liability if the content is being algorithmically amplified, not through “a neutral mechanism, such as through the use of chronological functionality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FQumcX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how lethal misinformation can be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MDR5zl"&gt;“For far too long, online platforms have not done enough to protect the health of Americans. These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation,” Klobuchar said in a statement Thursday. “The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how lethal misinformation can be and it is our responsibility to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDG5dZ"&gt;It’s not clear that removing Section 230 protections would have the effect lawmakers intend. Section 230 protects platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22585152/biden-white-house-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-section-230-first-amendment"&gt;from liability for illegal content&lt;/a&gt; hosted on their platforms — but misinformation is not illegal in itself. As a result, it’s unclear what a potential lawsuit against Facebook for misinformation would look like, even once the protections of Section 230 are stripped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BaO8n"&gt;The bill’s introduction comes just a week after the Biden administration issued a new report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;calling out vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; on social media. The report called for an all-of-society push to address coronavirus misinformation, including new policy recommendations for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The report didn’t mention Section 230 but suggested that platforms redesign their algorithms to “avoid amplifying misinformation” and to build more “friction” into sharing functions to urge users to avoid sharing false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfOPaI"&gt;Shortly after the report’s release, White House officials and President Joe Biden called out Facebook specifically for its role in amplifying vaccine misinformation. Last Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;Biden told reporters that platforms&lt;/a&gt; like Facebook were “killing people” by platforming false vaccine information. A Facebook spokesperson responded, saying, “The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKjiGj"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583809/joe-biden-facebook-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-killing-people"&gt;Biden walked back&lt;/a&gt; that statement, saying that misinformation was “killing people,” not Facebook itself. Still, White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/biden-will-make-every-effort-to-convince-americans-to-get-vaccinated-wh-117059141549"&gt;told MSNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the administration was reviewing Section 230 in order to determine a means of combating COVID-19 misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JM5b3K"&gt;“Certainly they should be held accountable,” Bedingfield said of social media companies Tuesday. “It is a big and complicated ecosystem, and everybody bears responsibility to ensure that we are not providing people with bad information about a vaccine that will save their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCR7x6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZifISg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dead Space is getting a remake on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HymwvHcoYYJi7FFohmeKELtXg0g=/186x0:2241x1370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618390/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.55.22_PM_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4nwcyu"&gt;One of survivor horror’s most iconic games is getting a next-gen facelift. At its EA Play Live event, Electronic Arts revealed that a remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; is in development and will be launching on the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. The publisher says the game is “rebuilt from the ground up” with EA’s Frostbite engine, and studio Motive — best-known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496153/star-wars-squadrons-review-single-player-campaign-x-wing-tie-fighter-space-simulator-vr"&gt;the space shooter &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — will be handling development. There’s currently no release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqNXuc"&gt;This will mark the first entry in the franchise since &lt;em&gt;Dead Space 3&lt;/em&gt; in 2013. The franchise was originally created and developed by Visceral Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16491044/ea-visceral-games-shut-down-dead-space-studio-star-wars"&gt;which was shuttered in 2017&lt;/a&gt; while working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184562/ea-star-wars-open-world-cancelled-project-shut-down"&gt;a single-player &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; game that was eventually canceled&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Visceral spirit does live on in a way as former &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; executive producer Glen Schofield is working on &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2020/12/16/22178915/callisto-protocol-striking-distance-glen-schofield-interview-dead-space-sci-fi-horror-pubg"&gt;a new sci-fi horror game called &lt;em&gt;The Callisto Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battlefield 2042 players can build and share custom modes with Battlefield Portal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5_3DvjwserKP4kbL0MCzreGWIs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618336/KIN_Portal_Screenshot_08_MashUp_1920x1080_36533960f60d79f0ba19.70981622.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7pnx8"&gt;EA has announced a new feature coming to &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042. &lt;/em&gt;Called &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; Portal, it’s a customizable creative mode that will let players create and share their own unique battles and multiplayer scenarios that combine weapons, maps, and vehicles from across the franchise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L06Yc"&gt;Portal goes beyond the custom multiplayer mode settings that are typical for an online shooter, though, by allowing players to mix and match elements not just from &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, but from earlier titles in the series like &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1942&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield: Bad&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Company 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4hyBRHbh6agNB7hftGBdj7hqNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732823/KIN_Portal_Screenshot_02_ElAlamein_1920x1080_36533960f60d716bf117.48560501.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9rAN5"&gt;Players will also be able to incorporate weapons, gadgets, and vehicles from across the various historical eras, alongside classic factions pulled from the previous games. Portal will incorporate the various multiplayer classes from those earlier titles, meaning that you’ll be able to play as &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/em&gt;’s Recon role just like you did in 2011. And of course, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;’s new additions to the franchise will be available to work with, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvnQvt"&gt;For example, players will be able to create battles pitting teams of soldiers pulled from &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1942&lt;/em&gt; against the futuristic military of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, or a vehicle match between classic WW2 planes and modern attack helicopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAXAS4"&gt;And in addition to offering &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;’s new complement of maps to play with, Portals will also offer six classic maps: &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1942&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Battle Of The Bulge and El Alamein maps, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield: Bad Company 2&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Arica Harbor and Valparaiso maps, and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/em&gt;’s Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals maps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwjLRj"&gt;Dice says that it’ll also be adding any new content it adds to the main &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; to Portal, so there will be plenty of new toys to play with in the custom mode as additional weapons, vehicles, and classes are added over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpXtGa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; is set to release on October 22nd for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox Series X / S, and PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yep, Jordan Peele’s next movie is called Nope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pLQt00TTx1ZZH63bSagDFNFDORg=/0x51:1238x876/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618331/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.16.38_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6PukQW"&gt;Critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele’s next “terror” is officially called &lt;em&gt;Nope, &lt;/em&gt;according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/1418224340764614656?s=20"&gt;a poster&lt;/a&gt; the director shared on Thursday. The details of the project remain (delightfully) shrouded in mystery, and you’ll still have a bit longer to wait before you can see it yourself — &lt;em&gt;Nope &lt;/em&gt;is scheduled to be released in theaters on July 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGo95K"&gt;There’s not a ton to go off of in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/1418224340764614656?s=20"&gt;the poster Peele tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, but it does feature an ominous dark cloud with what looks like a kite string trailing out the back of it. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/994004752466767872?s=20"&gt;Peele’s tease&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257721/us-review-jordan-peele-get-out-lupita-nyongo-winston-duke-elisabeth-moss-tim-heidecker-horror"&gt;his last film &lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was equally evocative and obtuse, so while there’s probably meaning to be gleaned from a mysterious cloud rolling over a mountain town, it’s also just nice to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlaoR5m4L80"&gt;let the mystery be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HWTA2Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;☁️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/iiDRwVLmbr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iiDRwVLmbr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jordan Peele (@JordanPeele) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanPeele/status/1418224340764614656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuhD8H"&gt;The new poster also confirms that the cast for &lt;em&gt;Nope&lt;/em&gt; is as stacked as the film is mysterious. &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/04/steven-yeun-jordan-peele-new-movie-1234627528/"&gt;Both Steven Yeun and Daniel Kaluuya&lt;/a&gt; were rumored to be in talks to join the film in April 2021, but now their participation is confirmed. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/jordan-peele-keke-palmer-film-1234694742/"&gt;Keke Palmer was cast in the film&lt;/a&gt; in February as the female lead. What exactly the three actors will have to do with a physical (and likely metaphorical) cloud remains to be seen, but feel free to get your meteorological speculative engines running while we begin the wait for a trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wSUZB"&gt;Lucid Motors is on the precipice of completing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;merger&lt;/a&gt; that will give the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder"&gt;Saudi-owned&lt;/a&gt; electric vehicle startup $4.5 billion in fresh capital. But the deal is being held up, in part, by spam filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdO3iz"&gt;The California-based startup is merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, called Churchill Capital IV that is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange. For the merger to go through, Churchill shareholders have to approve a number of proposals that outline the terms. That vote was supposed to close today, but Churchill &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/churchill-capital-corp-iv-to-adjourn-and-reconvene-special-meeting-of-stockholders-to-friday-july-23-2021-to-allow-stockholders-more-time-to-vote-on-one-remaining-required-proposal-for-the-business-combination-with-lucid-motors-301339577.html"&gt;extended the deadline to Friday&lt;/a&gt; because not enough shareholders have approved a key proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYVBN7"&gt;There are a few possible reasons why. The first is the spam filter issue. To participate in that vote, shareholders are sent a specific code. It’s possible, Churchill chairman Michael Klein said on a call with investors on Thursday, that some shareholders haven’t voted yet because these codes went straight to spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQp3S7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“some of those emails may have gone into your spam folder”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QWnab9"&gt;“It should have been mailed or emailed to all stockholders. I know this is technical. And I know that some of those emails may have gone into your spam folder or otherwise. But it’s critical and important to vote and to have the tools to vote,” he said. “I need to remind you to check your emails, and check your spam emails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTgppZ"&gt;The other reasons have more to do with just how wild the stock market has gotten in the last two years. Churchill announced the merger in February, and in the months since, its shares have been one of the most heavily traded of all the SPACs on the market. Some of that comes from people really believing in Lucid Motors and its potential in the growing market for electric vehicles. But since the beginning of the pandemic there’s been an enormous influx of “retail traders,” everyday people buying and selling stocks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;apps such as Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop and AMC&lt;/a&gt;, the more popular Churchill stock became, the more it may have looked like a good way to make some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZveRYw"&gt;Since many of these retail traders are new to the stock market, they’re less likely to understand the vagaries of SPAC mergers. That’s fine; most people had never heard of SPACs before they took off last year. But if they simply bought what they thought was a hot stock, they may not even know about the vote in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uG4s8V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Please, please vote”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAVkBQ"&gt;“We welcome all of the new shareholders,” Klein said Thursday. “However, we need you to participate in the election process. In particular, if you are participating from the new trading platforms, the new apps that may not necessarily be directing you clearly to a voting service — we need your vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMoTFE"&gt;Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson made a similar plea. “I want to be super clear about this. I need you to vote for proposal two,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how large or small you are. Every single investor vote counts, we’re all in this. So whether you’re a Robinhood trader or managing your portfolio via a traditional brokerage, please, please vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6egLDW"&gt;Finally, since apps like Robinhood have lowered the burden to play the stock market, retail traders are more likely to turn around and sell the shares they buy instead of holding on through the merger. And this can make it hard for companies to know who owns their shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4hxqSm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some SPACs are having trouble running down shareholders&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1WHgW"&gt;Public companies use third-party services known as “proxy solicitors” who are supposed to keep tabs on shareholders so they can be reached when it’s time to vote on company matters. But this has gotten harder because so many people are trading SPAC shares, an employee of a company that recently merged with a SPAC tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. This person said the spreadsheet their company received from the proxy solicitor was full of disconnected numbers or old AOL email accounts. Even when the company was able to track down the shareholder to ask them to vote, there was a good chance that person had already sold their shares to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYi5fs"&gt;Klein and Rawlinson said they still expect the merger to close on Friday, and for Lucid Motors to take Churchill’s place as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. And while they’re &lt;a href="https://spacinsider.com/2020/09/28/forum-merger-ii-secures-sufficient-votes-for-extension-following-delay/"&gt;not the first to run into trouble trying to round up enough shareholders&lt;/a&gt; to approve a SPAC merger, the $4.5 billion investment hanging in the balance makes this last-minute delay feel just a bit more precarious.&lt;/p&gt;
