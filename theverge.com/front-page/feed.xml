    <title>The story of Basecamp’s disastrous policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OH_RqBSqxWbKozaAqbBEVWx4Os4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237755/acastro_210503_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Basecamp’s CEO published a blog post about policy changes — it may have broken the company&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ep2jnm"&gt;On April 26th, Basecamp founder and CEO Jason Fried &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;posted on his blog&lt;/a&gt; about some policy changes that would be happening at the company, which makes team collaboration software. One policy stuck out to many on the internet — the company would no longer be allowing its employees to have discussions about society or politics on its internal account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXoHuB"&gt;What followed was a tidal wave of public outcry, employees speaking out against the policies (and talking about what led to them),&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412714/basecamp-employees-memo-policy-hansson-fried-controversy"&gt; several revisions of the blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and, finally, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22182249"&gt;almost a third of the company’s employees&lt;/a&gt; deciding to accept buyouts and leave. There has &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22183840"&gt;since been an apology from Fried&lt;/a&gt;, but it remains to be seen if any more will be coming — there are still accusations made by employees that haven’t really been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpwOlP"&gt;Whether you’re looking to get caught up on the saga, or want to keep your eye out for future updates, we’re collecting the story into one place here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I like X-wings as much as the next guy, but we don’t need one in the Smithsonian</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9md80o83W3Afkuplo43TD7jUk6s=/0x21:490x348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237645/Composite_X_wing.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2vqDzs"&gt;May Fourth is informally the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Day holiday, which random brands typically use to hawk their wares. Although it’s not as bad as the promotions that come out of the woodwork on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22359046/april-fools-day-brands-pr-bad-stop"&gt;April Fools’ Day&lt;/a&gt;, I think I’m drawing the line at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum adding an X-wing Starfighter from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to its collection. &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/newsroom/press-releases/national-air-and-space-museum-welcomes-star-wars-x-wing-starfighter?fbclid=IwAR1Hubkz2IV_RfRWK1tMc5Fc8SZ4zbAt53IgKT6417AEohRWKyIsS5ODFEI"&gt;The museum announced today&lt;/a&gt; that the famous ship would be going on display in 2022, via a prop loan from the Disney-owned production company, Lucasfilm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVoM72"&gt;The Smithsonian says the X-wing in question is from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt; and will be displayed outside the museum’s Albert Einstein Planetarium after undergoing “conservation in the Restoration Hangar in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5L5WC2ZIDzuFWc4L24FXRY5KZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491583/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_11.53.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The X-wing starfighter in the Mary Baker &lt;/em&gt;Engen&lt;em&gt; Restoration Hangar.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V1ewY4"&gt;The first red flag I’d like to get out of the way: an X-wing from &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt;? Really? The final film in the Skywalker Saga &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21026630/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-jj-abrams-daisy-ridley-adam-driver"&gt;is not exactly beloved&lt;/a&gt;, but we don’t really need to rehash that here. That’s what Reddit is for, and now, probably, my email inbox. What’s striking about calling out &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker &lt;/em&gt;to me is it really adds to the general feeling that including this spaceship is an advertising opportunity for Disney rather than some kind of grand contribution to our national memory of space travel. Of course Disney wants to continue to advertise its most recent &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;film — it’s got a franchise to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjzsLM"&gt;“Despite taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; introduced generations of fans here on Earth to outer space as a setting for adventure and exploration,” shared Margaret Weitekamp, Smithsonian space history chair. That’s undoubtedly true. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; has had a huge impact &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/how-star-wars-inspires-real-scientists-and-engineers"&gt;on how people think about space&lt;/a&gt;, and Disney, with everything it’s made and purchased, has made about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;as big an impression on culture&lt;/a&gt; as a billion-dollar company can make. But that doesn’t keep this all from feeling a little icky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7mNXw"&gt;Space and air travel have long been driven by public and private partnerships (see NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;current dealings with SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;), and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum even has other Disney products in its collection, like &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/toy-buzz-lightyear-space-flown/nasm_A20120233000"&gt;a Buzz Lightyear toy that’s been to space&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/insignia-unit-10th-weather-squadron-united-states-army-air-forces/nasm_A19711344000"&gt;a Donald Duck Air Force patch&lt;/a&gt;. But I come to museums like the Smithsonian for the pieces of history and culture I don’t know about — the hidden triumphs, failures, and once-in-a-lifetime chances that lead to impressive things like landing people on the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDX5US"&gt;Not long ago, the Smithsonian hosted the &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/command-module-apollo-11/nasm_A19700102000"&gt;Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, the pod that returned three astronauts to Earth from mankind’s first trip to the Moon in 1969. The museum also currently has &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lunar-module-2-apollo/nasm_A19711598000"&gt;the LM-2&lt;/a&gt;, the second Lunar Module that was used in ground tests on Earth. These are all real spacecraft, and that’s not even counting the &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/communications-satellite-applications-technology-satellite-1-ats-1/nasm_A19761985000"&gt;satellites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/payload-scientific-spartan-201/nasm_A20040121000"&gt;payloads&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/rake-apollo/nasm_A19781497000"&gt;other space ephemera&lt;/a&gt; that the Smithsonian has on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ighNns"&gt;It’s not that &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;or the X-wing aren’t cool, good, or significant. It’s that yielding physical and mental space to a product that’s meant to be sold rather than something that’s actually a part of human history feels like it distracts from the more meaningful pieces in the Smithsonian’s collection. Leave the props to the movies or Disney’s own curatorial efforts. I don’t think we’d be any worse for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T violated labor law but can still ban workers from recording conversations, NLRB rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the AT&amp;amp;amp;T logo is seen behind a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGaP4iyZJ5usl-36np8MwMpow54=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237561/1231517624.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8kGWp"&gt;An AT&amp;amp;T policy that bars employees from recording conversations with managers or colleagues is legal, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-CA-178637"&gt;ruling from the National Labor Relations Board Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The board found that while AT&amp;amp;T violated US labor law in how it had applied the policy, the recording ban itself was not illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJMi09"&gt;According to AT&amp;amp;T’s rules, “employees may not record telephone or other conversations they have with their co-workers, managers or third parties unless such recordings are approved in advance by the Legal Department.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECrBeb"&gt;In its decision, the NLRB overturned part of an earlier ruling which said that the policy’s potential to infringe on workers’ rights outweighed AT&amp;amp;T’s need to keep customer data private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im8CHx"&gt;The case centers on a complaint filed by AT&amp;amp;T employee Marcus Davis in 2016. Davis served as the union steward for the Communications Workers of America Local 2336. In May 2016, he attended a meeting with an employee who was being fired and recorded the conversation. Davis’s manager found out, asked to meet with him, and deleted the recording off of his phone. He later told Davis not to encourage other employees to make in-store recordings since doing so violated AT&amp;amp;T’s rules, and noted he “did not want anyone held accountable for not following policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BP9jl"&gt;The NLRB found that Davis was engaged in protected union activity. The board said AT&amp;amp;T violated federal labor law by telling him not to encourage colleagues to make recordings and implying that there could be repercussions for those who did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAwj6D"&gt;Yet the board also said that just because the policy was &lt;em&gt;applied&lt;/em&gt; illegally doesn’t mean it is inherently illegal. “A blanket prohibition on the continued maintenance of such rules, simply because of a single instance of unlawful application — even if that single instance is carried out by a misguided low- or mid-level supervisor whose action does not reflect corporate policy — fails to give proper weight to those legitimate interests,” the board wrote. “Indeed, it fails to give them any weight at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKF8HX"&gt;In her dissent, NLRB chairman Lauren McFerran said the rule was unlawfully over broad. “We all agree that some recordings by employees are protected by the National Labor Relations Act,”  she wrote. “By its terms, the rule does not differentiate between recordings protected by the National Labor Relations Act and those that are not...Indeed, as written, the rule applies even to conversations on nonwork time and in nonwork areas: an employee could not record a union meeting held in a breakroom at lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaGYli"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC may announce two new Vive VR headsets on May 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wyAXo64b5GDq8RdrBRyVqesJksM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237537/akrales_191003_3707_0159.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HacaWl"&gt;HTC is planning to unveil two Vive virtual reality headsets at its ViveCon 2021 conference that’s happening on May 11th and May 12th, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/htc-vr-focus3-vive-pro"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the original Vive and Vive Pro headsets were associated more with gaming, the high-end Vive Pro 2 and Vive Focus 3 Business Edition will reportedly be aimed toward the enterprise sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt2xLO"&gt;No specs or images of either headset have surfaced, so it’s unclear if both will be tethered headsets that require a PC to use or if one will have a standalone, wire-free design to take on the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Wjum2"&gt;The report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;states that both headsets were mentioned in HTC company documents and were also briefly listed on European e-commerce site Alzashop. Before those shop listings were taken down, the Vive Focus 3 Business Edition showed a €1,474 ($1,771) price, and the Vive Pro 2 was listed for €842 ($1,012), according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. Both headsets are reportedly launching sometime in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fLBvB"&gt;These headsets could be exciting in their own ways, but another device I’m holding out hope to see at ViveCon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/4/21/22395284/htc-vive-air-leak-fitness-headset-concept-not-real-product"&gt;is the fitness-focused Vive Air&lt;/a&gt;. Pictures leaked a couple of weeks ago showing an attractive standalone VR headset with a breathable fabric design, and it prompted HTC to say that, unfortunately, it’s just a concept. But maybe that’s just what a company trying to downplay an exciting announcement would say, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUX9K6"&gt;We’ll know much more come May 11th at HTC’s VR conference, where the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2Fvivecon2021%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419755%2Fhtc-vive-pro-2-focus-3-business-edition-virtual-reality-vr-headset-vivecon-rumor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says it will debut “game-changing VR headsets” during the keynote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IJZEWN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"HTC now lets you directly buy Vive repair parts through iFixit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405537/htc-vive-ifixit-repair-parts-guide-direct-to-consumer-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to turn your Lenovo laptop into an Echo Show, if you want to do that for some reason</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/exiGEvmYbaDYeUwFKSpgIBTYIK8=/0x25:1024x708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237417/IdeaPad_5_Series_Alexa_Screenfill_Reflection_2_e1609787235187_1024x732.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmbWC7"&gt;A new Show Mode feature from Amazon is now rolling out to some Lenovo laptops. When you activate this, it will change your home screen to look like the home screen of an Echo Show smart display, in a similar fashion to the Show Mode feature on Amazon’s tablets. That means you’ll be able to do smart display things like controlling smart home devices, glancing at the weather and news headlines, and chatting with Alexa — you know, the kind of stuff you’ve always wished you could do on your ThinkPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9T5F2y"&gt;The feature is currently rolling out to Yoga, ThinkPad, and IdeaPad PCs that have Alexa built in, and it’s available in the US, UK, Germany, Japan, India, Ireland, Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand. Lenovo says it’s coming to more Alexa-enabled PCs later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKEhsV"&gt;If you’re interested in trying it out, open the Alexa app (it should come up if you type “Alexa” into the Windows search bar) and press the Show Mode button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YbUU8s_j5b6NeQe3BbW36epvaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439407/mchin_20190703_4517_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would love if this ThinkPad X12 Detachable could use Show Mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 angled slightly to the right, open. The screen displays an outdoor nighttime scene with the Lenovo logo on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EXDIGoXf3RedDTim02P3NoPSc-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395211/mchin_20190614_4484_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This ThinkPad X1 Extreme? Not so much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dc6LqZ"&gt;Lenovo first announced this feature at &lt;a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/all-new-connected-consumer-experiences-start-with-lenovo/"&gt;CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; with its Yoga Slim 9i. Chromebooks have had this feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22250866/chrome-os-chromebook-lock-screen-personalize-how-to"&gt;for a while&lt;/a&gt; — they can act like a Nest Hub Max when they’re not actively in use, though I can’t say I’ve ever taken advantage of this as a frequent Chromebook user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4B3yS"&gt;Really, Show Mode seems like it would be the most useful on a device with a tablet form factor, which may not always be around its keyboard and touchpad. It could be cool on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;ThinkPad X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt;, for example, though the X12 unit that I reviewed earlier this year didn’t come with Alexa. But hey, if you want to try this out on your clamshell, don’t let me stop you. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Novi9Y"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 3 was first released in September 2017, bringing fitness improvements and a faster processor. Nearly four years later, in 2021, Apple is still selling the Series 3 as its entry-level Apple Watch model starting at $199, an $80 savings compared to the more recent Apple Watch SE. Only, as I’ve recently learned, “still selling” and “supporting in a reasonable manner” are two very different things, and updating an Apple Watch Series 3 in 2021 is a nightmare of infuriating technological hoops to jump through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoLbgp"&gt;Normally, updating an Apple Watch is an annoyingly long but straightforward process: you charge your Watch up to 50 percent, plug it in, and wait for the slow process of the update transferring and installing to your smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBMQL9"&gt;But the non-cellular Apple Watch Series 3 has a tiny 8GB of internal storage, a fair chunk of which is taken up by the operating system and other critical software. So installing a major update — like the recently released watchOS 7.4 — goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="N0ZP6p"&gt;Unpair and wipe your Apple Watch to factory settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="onsN8l"&gt;Set up the Apple Watch again and restore from backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CuJz8D"&gt;Realize you weren’t supposed to restore from your backup yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HHVXuu"&gt;Watch an episode or two of &lt;em&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/em&gt; while you wait for the backup to finish restoring &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JC5thp"&gt;Start from step one again — but as a brand-new Apple Watch, without restoring from an existing backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8em0yG"&gt;Update completely fresh Apple Watch, which now has enough free memory to update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y27oSu"&gt;Consider how much you actually want to use this face unlocking feature everyone keeps hyping up in the first place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vTOHQq"&gt;Unpair and wipe the Apple Watch a third time &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zfIcLk"&gt;Restore from your backup and finally use normally &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="VN9e8r"&gt;And the issue seems to apply whether you’ve installed a pile of apps or not. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211283"&gt;Apple’s support website doesn’t even recommend&lt;/a&gt; that Series 3 owners bother trying to clear up space — it just advocates that they go straight to the aforementioned reset cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbnkFB3jL9oVCroM-h2Unt8uiVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491512/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_2.22.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pBJTT"&gt;It’s clear that the current process is untenable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnU84A"&gt;I’m an editor at a technology news site and willing to put in the comical amount of time and energy to manage this, frustrating as it might be. But if you’re a more casual user — the same one who is likely to own an older, outdated Watch in the first place — why on earth would you bother with the worst update mechanism since GE’s instructions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692583/c-by-ge-reset-insanity-internet-of-shit"&gt;for resetting a smart bulb&lt;/a&gt;? And being able to update your hardware’s software is important: the just-released watchOS 7.4.1, for example, patches a critical security flaw. But with it being so difficult to install, there’s a good chance that plenty of Series 3 owners won’t bother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhAbfO"&gt;I know that Apple loves to claim support for as many older hardware generations as it can with each new update. It’s one of the biggest appeals of Apple products, compared to the lackluster pace of updates on competing Android phones (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419205/samsung-galaxy-s8-security-update-schedule"&gt;just-deprecated Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAhjoU"&gt;But the miserable update process for the Series 3 is a strong argument that Apple is being a little too generous with what it considers “current” hardware. Keeping the Series 3 around this long was always a money grab, a way for Apple to clear out old inventory and take advantage of mature manufacturing processes that have long since broken even in order to appeal to users who &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; can’t afford the extra $80 for the markedly better Apple Watch SE. It’s a similar trend to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-hd%2F32gb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F4%2F22419569%2Fapple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inexplicably still-on-sale Apple TV HD&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost six years old and costs just $30 less than the brand-new 4K model. (Much like the Series 3, don’t buy a new Apple TV HD in 2021 either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m3cqV"&gt;But hopefully, with the announcement of watchOS 8 almost assuredly around the corner at WWDC this June, the company takes into account the basic functionality of its hardware when considering what it does and doesn’t offer support for. Because if Apple is going to insist on selling a product this old in the future, it’s going to need to be a lot more mindful of just how it actually handles its software support. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Basecamp CEO apologizes to staff in new post: ‘We have a lot to learn’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KKoYWie3h97Tve-DeoaFnSxD7Tc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237186/acastro_210427_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGk0QD"&gt;In a new blog post,&lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/an-update-303f2f99"&gt; Basecamp CEO Jason Fried apologized&lt;/a&gt; after the “policy changes” he announced last week ultimately led to a third of the company’s workforce opting to leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSiBc3"&gt;“Last week was terrible. We started with policy changes that felt simple, reasonable, and principled, and it blew things up culturally in ways we never anticipated,” Fried wrote. “David and I completely own the consequences, and we’re sorry. We have a lot to learn and reflect on, and we will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQwEBo"&gt;The blog post that started the software company’s terrible week was a &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;list of new company policies&lt;/a&gt; that prohibited, among other things, “societal and political discussions” on internal forums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HFRQ9e"&gt;Today’s social and political waters are especially choppy. Sensitivities are at 11, and every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy, or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant. You shouldn’t have to wonder if staying out of it means you’re complicit, or wading into it means you’re a target. These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work. It’s become too much. It’s a major distraction. It saps our energy, and redirects our dialog towards dark places. It’s not healthy, it hasn’t served us well. And we’re done with it on our company Basecamp account where the work happens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="d104Vi"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contributing editor Casey Newton later reported&lt;/a&gt;, the initial motivation for the letter arose from uncomfortable internal disagreements over a list of “funny names” of Basecamp customers. Several of the names on the list, of which management was well aware, were of Asian or African origin. Employees considered their inclusion inappropriate at best and racist at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfJZRQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412714/basecamp-employees-memo-policy-hansson-fried-controversy"&gt;Backlash to Fried’s first blog post&lt;/a&gt; was swift and immediate and was followed by another post a few days later from company co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e"&gt;outlining a severance package&lt;/a&gt; for employees who weren’t comfortable with the company’s new direction. “No hard feelings, no questions asked,” Hansson wrote. “For those who cannot see a future at Basecamp under this new direction, we’ll help them in every which way we can to land somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6KioR"&gt;But it was an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hands-meeting-employee-resignations-buyouts-implosion"&gt;all-hands meeting last Friday&lt;/a&gt;, Newton reported, that apparently pushed some employees who were on the fence to actually take the severance offer. Basecamp’s longtime head of strategy, Ryan Singer, questioned the existence of white supremacy at the company to the dismay of other employees. Singer, who had been with the company 18 years, eventually resigned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehUEAX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the all-hands meeting that led to a third of Basecamp employees quitting","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hands-meeting-employee-resignations-buyouts-implosion"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3QyAOb"&gt;Fried’s post on Tuesday included an apology, but it didn’t specifically reference any of the tension that preceded it and didn’t mention the situation with Singer at all. It also didn’t outline any specific changes Basecamp plans to make. For a company that’s been under the spotlight for a serious internal misstep, Fried’s post felt a bit like a placeholder until the promised third-party investigation takes place. Clearly, he and Basecamp had to address the situation publicly somehow. He wrote that the company would be “rooting for” the employees who left and apologized again to those who opted to stay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PPShW0"&gt;Second, to our staff who remains with us: We know it’s tough to see colleagues leave, and we’re sorry we put you through that experience, but we deeply appreciate that you’re sticking with us. We have a great team in place, and it’s been wonderful and inspiring to see everyone helping one another, depending on each other, pitching in wherever they can, and supporting all our customers. A deep, heartfelt thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jE2p32"&gt;Fried’s latest post also attempts to reassure customers that Basecamp is still committed to supporting them. “Our Technical Operations and Customer Support teams continue to ensure all our products are running smoothly, support requests are being answered, and new customer signups continue as usual.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFxJmS"&gt;Fried closes with a promise to “regroup, rebuilt and get back to the business of making great software” — but, again, didn’t offer any specifics about what that would look like. “We’ve been in business for 22 years, through thick and thin,” he wrote. “We’re in it until the end of the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google prematurely announces ‘Pixel Buds A-Series’ with now-deleted tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_PD1_cHCLjXAnx68fkbmtT5uJI=/82x0:1333x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237170/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_4.56.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X4BOpf"&gt;Google seems to be getting a little ahead of itself. This afternoon, as noticed by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and others, the official Android account on Twitter tweeted a photo of the “Pixel Buds A-Series” and said the earbuds “have arrived.” Except... they definitely haven’t. Google has yet to properly announce the Pixel Buds A-Series, which are expected to be sold at a lower price than the standard $179 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOM3Pz"&gt;The tweet, which also mentioned the “quality sound and quick Bluetooth pairing” of Google’s latest buds, has since been deleted. Google has a history of, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663172/google-pixel-4-camera-sensor-design-official-photo"&gt;just tweeting out future products&lt;/a&gt;, but this does seem to have been an error.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqg6r9wuJzzxXeOfTqUNTnYdL3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491938/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_5.03.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bUsgx5"&gt;Google I/O 2021 is scheduled to start in two weeks on May 18th. But based on the mistaken scheduled tweet, it looks like the Pixel Buds A-Series are very much ready to go. Maybe they’ll end up being introduced before the developer conference gets underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0L2yuH"&gt;The earbuds have already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370608/google-pixel-buds-a-photo-leak"&gt;appeared in a marketing email&lt;/a&gt; to customers. They look largely identical to the 2020 Pixel Buds, so we’ll have to see where the company has possibly cut corners to bring the cost down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxOZXT"&gt;Pixel Buds A-Series. &lt;em&gt;Pixel Buds A-Series.&lt;/em&gt; It really just rolls right off the tongue, huh? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump’s ‘social media platform’ has launched and it’s just a blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the US President Donald Trump..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wl3V9r17SPiMhE05YQIpx2lTykA=/13x0:4531x3012/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69237068/1230683934.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SnCqg6"&gt;After months of promising &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-social-media-platform-return-adviser"&gt;his own social media network&lt;/a&gt; for banned posters, former President Donald Trump on Tuesday launched a new section of his website that’s essentially just a WordPress blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCVQdi"&gt;The new “platform” is styled like a generic version of Twitter but hosted as &lt;a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/desk"&gt;a running blog of commentary&lt;/a&gt; from Trump. People can sign up for post alerts on the platform through their email and phone numbers and are allegedly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASankin/status/1389678050422448129"&gt;able to like them&lt;/a&gt;, although that function doesn’t appear to work as of publication. Users are also allowed to share Trump’s posts on Facebook and Twitter. The Twitter sharing option doesn’t currently work, but Facebook’s does allow people to share Trump’s posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nM81zE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new “platform” is effectively a blog styled like a generic version of Twitter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cROHCz"&gt;“Generally, sharing content from the website reference is permitted as long as the material does not otherwise the Twitter Rules,” a Twitter spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLI4yK"&gt;Even though the platform formally launched on Tuesday, there are posts dating back to March 24th. Trump’s latest post is a video advertising his new platform, calling it “a place to speak freely and safely, straight from the desk of Donald J. Trump.” &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-launches-new-communications-platform-months-after-twitter-facebook-ban"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Trump will “eventually” be able to communicate with his supporters directly, although it’s not clear how that will happen. Trump’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AH4GWs"&gt;The launch comes just a day before Facebook’s Oversight Board is set to announce whether Trump will be allowed back on Facebook and other Facebook-owned social media platforms like Instagram. Trump was banned from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and his favorite posting platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in January after a right-wing mob stormed the US Capitol, leaving five people dead. Facebook’s quasi-judicial moderation panel plans to announce whether the former president can return on Wednesday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tE0iu"&gt;The platform appears to have been built by Campaign Nucleus, a digital services company founded by Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mpj7mC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at May 4th, 2021 at 7:33PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included a statement from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell is issuing a security patch for hundreds of computer models going back to 2009</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 from the back, angled to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PXe91tkK76wGRns3kp6VPgDPTW4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69236851/mchin_190124_4274_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7KgkN"&gt;Dell has released a security patch &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000186019/dsa-2021-088-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-dell-driver-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that fixes a security vulnerability affecting&lt;/a&gt; many Dell computers going back to 2009, along with instructions on how to install it if your computer is affected (&lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/dell-kernel-privilege-bugs/165843/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;threatpost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://labs.sentinelone.com/cve-2021-21551-hundreds-of-millions-of-dell-computers-at-risk-due-to-multiple-bios-driver-privilege-escalation-flaws/"&gt;found by security research firm SentinelLabs&lt;/a&gt;, is present in a driver used by Dell and Alienware’s firmware update utilities, and it allows an attacker to gain full kernel-level permissions in Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfQQ5C"&gt;If you have a Dell computer, there’s a good chance it could be vulnerable — &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000186019/dsa-2021-088-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-dell-driver-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the list of affected computers on Dell’s website&lt;/a&gt; has over 380 models on it, including some of the latest XPS 13 and 15 models, and the G3, G5, and G7 gaming laptops. Dell also lists almost 200 affected computers that it considers to be no longer receiving service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r26HUU"&gt;Both Dell and SentinelLabs say that they haven’t seen evidence of the vulnerability being exploited by hackers, despite the fact that it’s been around for so long. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000186020/additional-information-regarding-dsa-2021-088-dell-driver-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt; indicates that someone would have to have access to your computer in some way to take advantage of the bug, which they could get through malware, phishing, or being granted remote access privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0rPMq"&gt;It is also worth noting that, according to Dell, the vulnerable driver isn’t pre-loaded on systems — instead, it gets installed when the user updates their computer’s firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ppz8Yb"&gt;Still, even if you don’t remember doing anything like that, you should probably add opening the Dell or Alienware Update utility and installing anything available to your to-do list today.&lt;/p&gt;
