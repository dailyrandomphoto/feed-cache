    <title>Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G UW review: extreme durability for an extreme price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A pricey phone built to withstand the elements&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RqQfv2"&gt;The Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G is a rugged phone that doesn’t require you to give up too many modern conveniences to gain the benefits of extreme durability. It’s common for rugged phones to feature older processors and lack modern features — these phones often have specialized uses, like barcode scanning or taking payments, and more or less just need to keep working in harsh environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgtCHM"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G includes both the durability of a rugged phone and modern features like 5G, wireless charging, a high-quality processor, and dual rear cameras. At $899, it’s an expensive phone — you can buy a very nice non-rugged phone for that much — but if durability is a must and you don’t want to sacrifice performance or convenient features, the DuraForce 5G is (quite literally) a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EUeitz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCwS5H0Rr6eSgsG4CWaocFtUhG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526443/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W7VFuv"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G rugged features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bgM0jd"&gt;Pick up the DuraForce Ultra 5G and you’ll know right away that you have a rugged device in your hands. The top and bottom of the phone are wrapped in thick plastic bumpers, the sides feature a texturized finish, and at 278g (9.8oz) it’s much heavier than your standard smartphone. The screen itself isn’t very big — just a 5.45-inch 1080p LCD panel — but the sizable bezels and thick chin make it a chunky device overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdguzi"&gt;Despite its dimensions it’s actually easy to use one-handed, since the screen itself is relatively small. The phone will fit in a jacket pocket, but it’s too bulky for any of my jeans pockets. Haptics are aggressive, even at the “medium” default setting, which is a good thing in a phone you might be using with gloves. Otherwise, you can turn touch vibrations down to low or off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKFwdX"&gt;The phone is both IP65 and IP68 rated, meaning there’s generous protection against water intrusion both from jets and immersion (up to 6.5 feet for up to 30 minutes). The DuraForce Ultra 5G meets the Military Standard 810H specifications and includes protection against vibration, blowing dust and sand, extreme temperatures, drops from five feet onto concrete, high altitudes, and plenty of other hostile conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6wpa1D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hJWRm2"&gt;I couldn’t test it against all of those conditions, but I did subject the phone to plenty of abuse including an hourlong stay in the freezer, water immersion for 30 minutes in the kitchen sink, exposure to sand, and a drop from about five feet onto driveway asphalt. Aside from some minor scuffs acquired in the driveway test, the DuraForce Ultra 5G merely shrugged at my efforts and kept on working just fine. Kyocera does include a two-year warranty with purchase, so as long as you use the phone within the conditions it’s rated to withstand, you shouldn’t be putting your purchase at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpGg8x"&gt;In addition to rugged features, the DuraForce Ultra 5G is just loaded with buttons. There’s a power button with embedded fingerprint sensor, three programmable keys, and a large volume rocker that’s easy to press with gloves on. I frequently pressed one of the programmable buttons accidentally when I grabbed the phone — they’re in easy reach when you’re using the phone, but that unfortunately means a lot of unintentional presses, too. These buttons do require a long press to bring up whatever shortcut function you’ve assigned to them, so a brief press won’t do anything. You can also assign any of them to “do nothing” when pressed if you’d rather not use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLffBgLPWI_Llf-npqmIGqOt0UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526445/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GXpg0z"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="E8kAww"&gt;Aside from the obvious difference in appearance and ergonomics, the DuraForce Ultra 5G handles pretty much the way any other Android device does. The screen looks a little low on contrast in comparison to your standard display — likely because the panel is optimized for viewability in bright sunlight. That’s probably more important to the phone’s target user than a rich multimedia viewing experience, and the panel is indeed usable even in very bright direct light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sccb8"&gt;The screen’s protective “Sapphire Shield” remained free of scratches during my testing, but it does pick up reflections easily outside, more so than other phones with Gorilla Glass. It wasn’t enough to bother me, but someone planning to use the phone outside in bright light often might find it distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l13Zen"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G ships with Android 10; Kyocera says it will provide an update to 11, but that the timeframe is still being determined. Android 10 is fine for now, but given that Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;readying Android 12 for the public&lt;/a&gt;, it’s definitely a step behind. Kyocera says it will provide a minimum of two years of security updates, which is a common if not terribly generous policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EKwQAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPDPTP"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra 5G uses a Snapdragon 765G processor with 6GB RAM, which puts overall performance on par with a midrange phone. There’s some slight stuttering when scrolling quickly through screens with lots of images and video, and a noticeable pause after taking a photo in the camera app, but other than that it keeps up well — especially considering the lower performance bar in the rugged class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mjmbC"&gt;There’s a 4,500mAh battery built into the DuraForce Ultra 5G. It’s a comparatively large battery for the class, and it got me through a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports Qi wireless charging, which is uncommon among rugged phones. The phone was a little finicky on my stand-style Belkin wireless charger, but it eventually worked when set on the charger in landscape orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrNjuL"&gt;And of course, there’s one of the DuraForce Ultra 5G’s namesake features: 5G. This model works with both widely available sub-6GHz frequencies and hard-to-find but much faster mmWave spectrum (also called Ultra Wideband by Verizon, hence the UW in the phone’s name). It’s only sold through Verizon in the US, which makes sense: the company has been pushing mmWave much harder than the other major carriers and does offer more coverage, though it’s still relatively scarce. Verizon’s 5G network is kind of lackluster overall at this point, though it will improve over the next couple of years. It’s a good feature to have on a phone you’re going to hang onto for a while, but definitely don’t buy this (or any phone, really) just for mmWave since you’ll probably have a hard time finding a signal anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9K8_BvBox1IIgUPqGHpe6gIS1iE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526441/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SstD0A"&gt;Kyocera DuraForce Ultra 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nEfbUr"&gt;The DuraForce Ultra’s rear camera array consists of a 24-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide and a 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, plus a time-of-flight sensor. Around front, there’s an 8-megapixel f/2.0 selfie camera. That’s a cut above what’s offered on many rugged phones. Picture-taking likely isn’t a high priority for prospective DuraForce Ultra owners, and image quality is certainly not up to what you’d find on conventional $900 phones, but it does the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SUrxOC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10511127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkQEvB"&gt;Photos in good light look fine, if a bit on the low-contrast, washed-out side. Exposure and color can shift noticeably between two images taken with the same camera at slightly different angles, and I noticed some odd misses here and there, like a blurry shot of a static subject where it looked like the camera had tried to apply too much HDR. But most of the time in bright light, photos are perfectly fine, and a cut above what I’d expect from a rugged phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPE5GH"&gt;There’s also a mode that will overlay live information on your still image or video about whatever extreme situation you happen to be in, including location, altitude, speed, and G-force. Extreme activities are generally not recommended in your second trimester of pregnancy, so I didn’t really test this out. I imagine if you’re into something like mountain biking or climbing and you want to record that kind of information with your activity, you probably have a better way of doing so already. In any case, it’s there, and it’s definitely more of a casual, fun feature than it is practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdoMQqBzgM7hSRn2TD79gBmGDB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526440/ajohnson_20210514_4587_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lwm3nQ"&gt;If you’re merely curious about living a rugged phone lifestyle, the DuraForce Ultra 5G isn’t for you. The phone’s extremely hardy specifications would be appealing to anyone who’s nervous about dropping their phone or occasionally brings their phone to rough environments like beaches or backcountry camping. If that’s you, spend your $900 on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;good standard phone&lt;/a&gt; (many are IP68 rated) and a rugged case. You’ll get better performance, a better camera, timelier software updates — basically, a lot more for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uGUklv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jansg3"&gt;If you need a rugged phone on the job as a frontline worker, first responder, or construction worker, for example, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G makes a lot more sense — especially if it’s going to be your primary phone off the job and you’d really like some extra bells and whistles. The inclusion of 5G, wireless charging, and processing power that’s a cut above the rest of the class makes it a good tool on and off the job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gd8RS"&gt;However, $900 is an awful lot to spend on a phone, and I think that very specific kind of customer for this phone is a pretty small group. You could buy a less expensive rugged phone with more limited functionality like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/kyocera-duraforce-pro-2/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kyocera’s own DuraForce model from last year&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;darn good midrange phone&lt;/a&gt; for around the same price. You probably can’t get mmWave 5G that way, but that’s no great loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z3Jnx3"&gt;Still, the DuraForce Ultra 5G represents a convenient option for a particular type of person if two phones feels like too much fuss. It certainly handled everything I threw it at, and functioned well as a daily companion for more pedestrian tasks like scrolling social media and navigating trips across town. If extreme durability is a must and you don’t want to give up too much to get it, then the DuraForce Ultra 5G is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India reportedly orders social media platforms to remove references to “Indian variant” of COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5BMn9lPARBgY5gDIk6xrT_r6ck8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69330457/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K1T2Ap"&gt;India’s government has sent notices to social media platforms ordering them to take down content that refers to an “Indian variant” of the COVID-19 virus, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-asks-social-media-firms-remove-reference-indian-variant-coronavirus-2021-05-21/"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reported. The letter from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology sent Friday was not made public, but was viewed by several news outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRXYW2"&gt;It was not clear which social media outlets received the letter, but India’s government has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;ordered Twitter to remove tweets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook and Instagram to take down posts&lt;/a&gt; that were critical of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SBhjF"&gt;“There is no such variant of COVID-19 scientifically cited as such by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO has not associated the term ‘Indian Variant’ with the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in any of its reports,” the letter states, adding that the phrase is “completely FALSE.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd9Blk"&gt;A variant of the coronavirus first detected in India last year, B.1.617 is believed responsible for the latest wave of COVID-19 cases in south Asia. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/who-classifies-b1617-variant-first-identified-in-india-as-global-variant-of-concern-1.6020830"&gt;The World Health Organization has classified it&lt;/a&gt; as a variant of global concern, with some evidence that it is more contagious than other strains of the virus.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exJGOr"&gt;But while India’s approach to censoring information about the coronavirus and variants is extreme, WHO and other health organizations and scientists are critical of the practice of referring to viruses and variants with geographic nicknames, since it can be stigmatizing and inaccurate. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-05-2015-who-issues-best-practices-for-naming-new-human-infectious-diseases"&gt;WHO’s 2015 guidance&lt;/a&gt; for naming infectious diseases discourages using place names, human names, or animal species names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0zRVZ"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-virus-variants-get-their-confusing-names-and-how-to-make-them-better"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; notes in its very good explainer&lt;/a&gt; about how virus variants get their names, the current naming conventions are cumbersome and confusing, making them difficult for non-scientists to grasp or remember. &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; reports that WHO is working with virologists to create a new way of naming viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJHeno"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Samsung smartwatch partnership looks a lot like giving up</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZNgb0W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14546312/lg-watch-sport-style-review-android-wear-2-smartwatch"&gt;Once again&lt;/a&gt;, Google is hitting the reset button, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;combining with Samsung’s Tizen wearable operating system&lt;/a&gt; for a new wearable OS, tentatively called “Wear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohGKGe"&gt;The company is throwing in the towel on Wear OS. It’s trying yet again, this time with Samsung’s Tizen OS helping to fill in the gaps that Google, for whatever reason, can’t. It’s theoretically good news for Android owners interested in a decent smartwatch — but one that’s damning of Google’s lackluster efforts in the smartwatch space to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f0Zc37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"11 things we know about the new smartwatch OS from Google and Samsung — and some we don’t","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"},{"title":"Google and Samsung are merging Wear OS and Tizen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7nyCDt"&gt;In the years since Google first introduced Wear OS (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17124448/google-wear-os-announced-android-wear-rebranding-smartwatch"&gt;neé Android Wear&lt;/a&gt;), there’s never been a truly good Android-powered smartwatch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung’s Tizen-powered watches&lt;/a&gt; have been the best option for years, but they’re ultimately &lt;em&gt;Samsung&lt;/em&gt; watches. They still work best with Samsung phones, and while they’re good enough with other Android devices, there’s the friction of extra helper apps that need to be installed to get them to work. A seamless experience, it is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPgJVZ"&gt;It’s obvious why Google would want the benefits of battery life, app support, and performance that Samsung has cultivated over the past few years; but it’s harder to understand why Google hasn’t managed to build any of this themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqgw4D"&gt;Google is the creator of Android, one of the quintessential software development companies of the modern era, the brains behind the common component for over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440813/android-devices-active-number-smartphones-google-2021"&gt;three billion smartphones&lt;/a&gt; around the world. It’s resources are practically limitless, and it’s made some serious investments in smartwatch and wearables computing over the years: $40 million on some of Fossil’s secret wearable technologies in 2019, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement"&gt;recent $2.1 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; to buy Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;. (That’s not even counting the rest of Google’s hardware team, which includes its $1.1 billion for the HTC’s smartphone design team, and the existing Pixel hardware group.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PFEnutS4QYAybQWvveb1XzMCIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21900540/20200919FitbitSense4.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N4cyPw"&gt;Yet, despite all that hardware, software, and engineering prowess, Google has utterly failed to get its smartwatch platform from being anything other than a curiosity. Part of that can be blamed on the poor silicon support — Qualcomm’s Wear OS-powering Snapdragon chips saw a years-long drought before last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;Snapdragon 4100 was launched&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/05/12/in-a-year-we-got-exactly-1-snapdragon-wear-4100-watch/"&gt;Exactly &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; Snapdragon 4100 watch&lt;/a&gt; has been launched. Google’s software updates to Wear OS in the past year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423707/google-wear-os-gboard-swipe-type"&gt;have been tiny, lackluster features&lt;/a&gt;. And there’s still no Pixel-esque reference device to show developers the platonic ideal, although that’s not exactly for lack of trying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Srqg91"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872740/google-pixel-smartwatch-flagship-why-it-failed-wear-os"&gt;had reportedly&lt;/a&gt; had a Pixel watch in the works at one point, but axed the concept over fears of bringing down Google’s burgeoning hardware ecosystem and software issues. The company also (wisely) chose to not attach its name to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14546312/lg-watch-sport-style-review-android-wear-2-smartwatch"&gt;LG’s lackluster watches in 2017&lt;/a&gt; either, and the brand has largely languished in obscurity since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJC5zC"&gt;Pixel devices occupy an outsized place in the smartphone world because of what they represent: Google’s pure, unadulterated vision for what Android could be, a place for other manufacturers of more popular phones to aspire to. The same could apply to watches if Google had any inclination to actually try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tVeiML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google almost had a Pixel smartwatch — here’s why it reportedly failed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872740/google-pixel-smartwatch-flagship-why-it-failed-wear-os"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="v4c6bh"&gt;But for the past few years, there’s been no cohesive vision for what Wear OS should be; Google hasn’t offered one. And by the looks of the recent Samsung partnership, it’s choosing to punt on the issue entirely, handing off the business of imagining the future of Android wearables to one of its partners instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4LCbu"&gt;Samsung &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5842804/this-is-the-gear-live-samsungs-199-android-wear-smartwatch"&gt;offer an Android Wear watch&lt;/a&gt;, until it jumped ship for its own Tizen platform. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;OnePlus’ recent smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; also skips Wear OS entirely. You have to have screwed up &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; to get partners to forgo the deep built-in integration and the wealth of apps on the Play Store, but Google has managed to accomplish it with Wear OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOzkXE"&gt;Maybe the Tizen-hybrid Wear will fix that. It’s certainly a win for Samsung, the hero that gets to provide the essential backbone for Google’s third-act of wearable hardware while reaping the benefits of the massive Android developer community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoasz"&gt;And Google does get some big benefits here. There’s one fewer competitor for its future smartwatch platform (something that there were already relatively few of outside of Apple after Google bought Fitbit.) And there’s also the potential of gaining Samsung’s semiconductor expertise for future smartwatch chips, which would certainly help with the Qualcomm issues that the company has had in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6urjUA"&gt;But Google hasn’t shown yet that it’ll handle the next phase of its wearables any better than the first two. And it’s a concerning start that a company that’s best known for leading on software innovation had to go and outsource its next wearable operating system to Samsung inste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnWxP7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUGKGH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the band making a giant marble-based instrument</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This machine plays marbles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wintergatan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eURomX"&gt;Swedish band Wintergatan may be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/2/11147884/marble-machine-music-wintergartan-martin-molin"&gt;widely known for its Marble Machine music video&lt;/a&gt; (which featured a machine dropping marbles to play drums, a bass, and other instruments), but today I learned that they’re building a bigger, better version, and documenting the entire process on YouTube. It’s called the Marble Machine X, and it’s driven by a motor instead of a hand crank, is being built by an entire team of people, and, hopefully will be able to go on tour and be played on stage when it’s finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXIhmY"&gt;Wintergartan also produced a build log of the first machine, but this new project is way grander in scope, offering a deeper look at the creative process that leads to... well, building a massive musical instrument that uses marbles. The band put out eight build videos for the original machine before it released its debut music video — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLLYkE3G1HED6rW-bkliHbMroHYFf4ukv"&gt;the build log for the Marble Machine X&lt;/a&gt; is at 161 videos and counting. (If you were looking for something to do this weekend, that’s quite a backlog of delightfully nerdy content to fill your time with!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBcKRq"&gt;It also turns out that, when you’re building a machine made to sling marbles to make tunes, almost every part of that process is interesting. The music nerd in me squealed in delight when Martin Molin, the band member that’s working with a team to build the machine, showed off &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygofdm9JB3g"&gt;the 28-audio channel cable&lt;/a&gt; they’re using to keep the machine looking clean and wire-free. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygofdm9JB3g"&gt;fascinating video that first got me hooked&lt;/a&gt;, where he shows off an immaculately-crafted wood piece that sorts marbles equally into four tracks. Or, rather, the piece of wood that doesn’t do that job properly, which is why he’s now designing a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IvTXF7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ygofdm9JB3g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyNi5X"&gt;The videos aren’t exactly obscure: Wintergatan has over 2.2 million subscribers on YouTube, and some of the videos about the Marble Machine X have close to that number of views. But somehow I, someone who routinely watches videos about people building &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYLBjScgb7o"&gt;weird, awesome instruments&lt;/a&gt;, had just missed it until now, so I figured I’d share the joy in case the YouTube algorithm had also kept this hidden from you. I can’t wait to hear Wintergatan fully turn the thing on, and do an epic remaster of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q"&gt;original Marble Machine song&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic spaceplane VSS Unity completes successful flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0tWf1S05usIHuajcpWyk4wKcEE=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328384/Unity21___VSS_Unity_in_space_over_New_Mexico.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;VSS Unity in space over New Mexico on May 22nd. | Virgin Galactic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbGNaU"&gt;Richard Branson’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Virgin Galactic completed its first successful space flight in more than two years on Saturday, with its crewed VSS Unity spacecraft carried to an altitude of more than 44,000 feet before gliding safely back to Earth. It marked the first spaceflight from New Mexico, making it the third US state to launch humans into space. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico"&gt;The Zia sun symbol&lt;/a&gt; of New Mexico’s state flag was displayed on the outside of the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJfZWr"&gt;Virgin’s VMS Eve carrier aircraft took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico at about 10:35AM ET with Unity aboard. About 10 minutes before its release, Unity switched to its own battery power, and conducted flight control and electrical checks. Once released by Eve, Unity’s pilots C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay ignited the rocket motor, then shut it down a few minutes later, with the spacecraft’s momentum keeping it traveling toward its apogee, or highest point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyKm2o"&gt;Unity reached a speed of Mach 3 after it was released from Eve, and reached space at an altitude of 55.45 miles.  It reached apogee at about 11:30AM ET, did a slow turn, then glided back into Earth’s atmosphere, landing at about 11:43 AM ET on the same Spaceport America runway where its flight began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="me7nHP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today’s view: Infinite. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unity21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unity21&lt;/a&gt; made a beautiful ascent to apogee over Spaceport America, New Mexico. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VirginGalactic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VirginGalactic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jphjbMbSr2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jphjbMbSr2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Virgin Galactic (@virgingalactic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1396166206604914689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0MX6rI"&gt;“It was picture perfect,” Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a phone interview Saturday after Unity and Eve were back on the ground. “We’re gonna go through the data deeply and thoroughly as we always do.” In a statement, Colglazier called the flight a “major step forward for both Virgin Galactic and human spaceflight in New Mexico,” which had never hosted a crewed test mission to space until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9GkWA"&gt;“You’ve never seen a mix of more proud parent engineers,” Colglazier said of Virgin Galactic’s engineering team. Dozens of company employees gathered to watch the test flight under clear blue skies at Spaceport America, the company’s HQ for future commercial missions. Champagne was popped to celebrate the craft’s landing and Branson, the company’s billionaire founder, was “electrified” to see it all play out, Colglazier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oY3VoQ"&gt;Saturday’s flight, which also carried research payloads for NASA’s Flight Opportunities program, is the latest step toward Virgin Galactic’s goal of a space tourism program. The company has some 600 reservations for tickets on future space flights, which go for around $250,000 each. Unity is able to carry up to six passengers and two pilots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GRYU5"&gt;It was Virgin Galactic’s first space flight since 2019, and the third one it’s completed. Unity’s first two flights, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18138279/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceshiptwo-space-tourism"&gt;in late 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18232354/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceplane-test-spaceflight-passenger-beth-moses"&gt;early 2019&lt;/a&gt;, were conducted at the company’s test facility at the Mojave Air and Spaceport out of California. Virgin Galactic later moved its operations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Spaceport America&lt;/a&gt;, where it plans to conduct all of its commercial tourist flights. The company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171114/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-powered-test-flight-abort-spaceport-america-new-mexico"&gt;abort its first flight attempt&lt;/a&gt; at the new facility in December, after Unity’s engine cut out early ahead of its glide back to Earth due to what the company later said was electromagnetic interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kagbfo"&gt;VSS Unity’s flight on Saturday featured some hardware upgrades installed since the December abort scenario, including a new digital controller that the pilots used for tighter handling. “This was our first run with it under full power, and it was flawless. Spot on,” Colglazier said. That controller will be used on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356889/virgin-galactic-unveils-new-spaceship-iii-three-3"&gt;SpaceShipThree&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s upgraded spacecraft tailored for routine production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxkVJf"&gt;Virgin Galactic said in February, and &lt;a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2021/q1/Virgin-Galactic_Q1-2021-Earnings-Slides_FINAL_5'10'21_12pm.pdf"&gt;confirmed during its May 10th earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, that it has a total of four spaceflights planned this year. The next one is slated to have two pilots and four Virgin Galactic employees as passengers, and a third flight is scheduled to have Virgin founder Richard Branson on board. Flight four is intended to be a commercial flight for the Italian Air Force, which should generate $2 million in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFYuwb"&gt;Saturday’s flight was the &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=97565"&gt;400th commercial space launch&lt;/a&gt; licensed by the FAA. The dates for the future Unity flights are still to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGpw3V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 22nd 2:17PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds details from Virgin Galactic about the flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7DMeY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 22nd 5:51PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds interview with Virgin Galactic CEO and more details about Unity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aerion Supersonic, which planned to make silent, fast business jets, is shutting down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmLAxXdc8_DqCbWcXWkLlCJAdeo=/145x0:879x489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328868/aerion.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Flying off into the sunset | Aerion&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXjRAv"&gt;Aerion Supersonic, which had plans to build silent business jets that would travel twice as fast as most commercial airplanes, is shutting down operations. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/21/aerion-supersonic-abruptly-shuts-down-citing-challenges-securing-capital/5208809001/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Florida Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Aerion, which &lt;a href="https://aerionsupersonic.com/boeing-partners-with-aerion-to-accelerate-supersonic-travel/"&gt;had backing from Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, said it was unable to raise the money to build its AS2 supersonic jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0mbzN"&gt;“The AS2 supersonic business jet program meets all market, technical, regulatory and sustainability requirements and the market for a new supersonic segment of general aviation has been validated with $11.2 billion in sales backlog for the AS2,” the company said in an statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X641l0"&gt;“However, in the current financial environment, it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements to finalize the transition of the AS2 into production. Given these conditions the Aerion Corporation is now taking the appropriate steps in consideration of this ongoing financial environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbTUlH"&gt;Aerion CEO Tom Vice said in January 2020 that the AS2 would likely cost about $4 billion for the company to develop, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/aerions-as2-silent-supersonic-jet-aims-to-fly-by-2024.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, it had already spent $1 billion to develop the AS2’s engine. And in April 2020, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/c21ad6baefffca81adb4bd6dde4dcb1c"&gt;Aerion was relocating its headquarters&lt;/a&gt; from Reno, Nevada to Melbourne, Florida, at a plant to be built at Orlando Melbourne International Airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1uyCt"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-22/texas-billionaire-s-supersonic-jet-dream-dies-as-aerion-folds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Aerion was in talks to go public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Those talks apparently did not come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfQYlt"&gt;The company’s AS2 was intended to travel at around 1,000 miles per hour, and its patented “boomless cruise” technology would have allowed it to fly without creating a sonic boom. The company had planned to fly its first AS2 by 2024, and begin commercial flights by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJoQ64"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese startup Pony.ai gets approval to test driverless vehicles in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China’s Robocars Are Way Behind Their U.S. Counterparts" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkqv6s0MyG5t7rAmbH8ADcIbUds=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328730/1142319105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Chinese autonomous vehicle startup Pony.ai has&lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-authorizes-pony-ai-to-test-driverless-vehicles-in-fremont-milpitas-and-irvine/"&gt; received a permit from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to test its driverless cars without human safety drivers behind the wheel on specified streets in three cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzoveN"&gt;Pony has been authorized to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers in California since 2017, but the new permit will let it test six autonomous vehicles without safety drivers on specific streets in Fremont, Alameda County; Milpitas, Santa Clara County; and Irvine, Orange County. According to the DMV, the vehicles are designed to be driven on roads with speed limits of 45 miles per hour or less, in clear weather and light precipitation. The first testing will be in Fremont and Milpitas on weekdays between 10AM and 3PM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAlGzj"&gt;A total of &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/"&gt;55 companies have active permits &lt;/a&gt;to test driverless vehicles in California according to the DMV, but Pony is only the eighth company to receive a driverless testing permit, joining fellow Chinese companies AutoX, Baidu, and WeRide, along with US companies Cruise, Nuro, Waymo, and Zoox. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197980/nuro-licensed-autonomous-deliveries-california"&gt;Nuro is the only company&lt;/a&gt; so far to receive a deployment permit that allows it to operate its autonomous vehicles in California commercially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9n14d"&gt;Pony.ai, which is based in Guangzhou and Silicon Valley, was valued at $3 billion after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;$400 million investment from Toyota&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company said earlier this month its robotaxis will be ready for customers in 2023. Pony claims it’s the first company to launch autonomous ride-hailing and provide self-driving car rides to the general public in China.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after future update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sD5nPS"&gt;In a new support document on its website, Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183"&gt;dives a little deeper into the details&lt;/a&gt; around the upcoming launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxkEOt"&gt;Apple now says that both the HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after a future software update. That’ll be good news to people who’ve invested in one or a pair of Apple’s smart speakers. Two HomePods grouped in stereo playing a lossless source? Yeah, that’s going to sound wonderful. Apple isn’t yet giving any timetable for when this software update will be released, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIusvP"&gt;The document also clarifies that the Apple TV 4K will only support standard lossless audio when the ALAC files become available in June. Apple has said that in most cases, the “Hi-Res Lossless” tier will require external devices like a USB DAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSkBY0"&gt;Apple uses the document to tout its “commitment” to providing customers with the best possible listening experience. It talks up both AAC — claiming that the format has become “virtually indistinguishable from the original studio recording” as encoding methods have evolved — and its Apple Digital Masters initiative. I continue to think that Apple is much more excited about spatial audio and Dolby Atmos mixes coming to Apple Music than anything to do with lossless itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8J91M"&gt;The document also reiterates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;what Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; in regards to the AirPods Max: when listening to audio via the Lightning-to-3.5mm cable, the company says it’ll sound fantastic, but it won’t technically be “lossless” due to an analog to digital conversion that occurs in the cable. Apple again confirms that lossless quality will be exclusive to Apple Music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YM2kOC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I redownload my iTunes purchases in lossless?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gM7OrM"&gt;If you subscribe to Apple Music, you can redownload music in lossless only from the Apple Music catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vYKo36"&gt;The straightforward answer to the question as written is really a flat “no,” but obviously Apple wants to nudge people towards its subscription service. Apple Music will offer over 20 million songs in lossless quality at launch in June, and that total will reach over 75 million by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s Fortnite trial testimony was unexpectedly revealing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLa-l7Gi7acAzhS7HlzqN7CSsE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328196/1233030839.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkoY2d"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was bookended by Tims. Epic Games called its CEO Tim Sweeney as the first witness nearly three weeks ago. Yesterday, Apple called Tim Cook as the last to take the stand, before both sides make their final case to a judge on Monday. Cook was supposed to bring home Apple’s defense of its ecosystem. He did it by laying out Apple’s most high-minded principles — but also its hard financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGpgYJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; covers two separate issues: whether the market for in-app purchases within the App Store is unfairly monopolistic, and whether iOS &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a monopoly that should be opened up to third-party stores and side-loaded apps. Cook addressed both with an appeal to user safety and privacy. “Privacy from our point of view is one of the most important issues of the century, and safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built upon,” he explained to an Apple attorney, echoing countless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;iPhone ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. “Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people, and we like to provide people tools to circumvent that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VthQ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhsVpC"&gt;Supporting side-loaded apps would remake iOS, and it’s much easier for Cook and Apple to outline the potential downsides. Giving users control creates risk, and Cook argued that people choose iOS specifically so they won’t have to make risky decisions with sensitive data. “We’re trying to give the customer an integrated solution of hardware, software, and services,” he said. “I just don’t think you replicate that in a third party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNnDYU"&gt;Epic mustered its own arguments: people can still choose to keep their phones locked down, and they might want to access stores with even more carefully curated apps or even better privacy controls. It’s previously accused Apple of hypocrisy, pointing out anecdotal failures to catch specific apps (like a game called &lt;em&gt;Ganja Farmer: Weed Empire&lt;/em&gt;) that violate App Store guidelines. “It’s not 100 percent. It’s not perfect. You will find mistakes being made,” Cook said when Apple’s counsel asked about those incidents. “But if you back up and look at it in the scheme of things, with 1.8 million or so apps on the store, we do a really good job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3WXYt"&gt;Luckily for Apple, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers hasn’t demonstrated much interest in completely opening up iOS. She’s asked a steady trickle of questions about in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering provisions&lt;/a&gt;, and the structure of individual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;apps like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely about third-party app distribution or sideloading. (One of those rare incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;seemed critical&lt;/a&gt; of Epic, too.) While Rogers’ questions don’t necessarily indicate how she’ll rule, there’s a fairly conspicuous lack of requests for more detail or clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h78mEu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azAogS"&gt;But losing mandatory in-app purchase commissions would still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21369460/apple-fortnite-app-store-services-business-model-epic-games"&gt;be a big blow&lt;/a&gt; for Apple. Cook used more privacy and safety claims to defend that system, saying it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separately. He was also, however, a little blunter about Apple’s own interests. “IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission” — for payment processing, but also customer service and the use of Apple’s intellectual property. Without in-app purchases, “we would have to come up with another system to invoice developers, which I think would be a mess.” If Apple let developers tell users about other payment methods, Cook said later, “we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUlxWp"&gt;Apple called an expert yesterday to describe how its multibillion-dollar research and development costs help developers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/21/6746613/first-games-ios-8-metal-graphics-available-download"&gt;through APIs like Metal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15725994/apple-mobile-ai-chip-announced-wwdc-2017"&gt;CoreML&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not necessarily sinister for Apple to profit from these investments. But unlike better privacy and safety features, higher profit margins don’t directly improve consumer welfare, the key standard in antitrust trials. Judge Rogers ended Cook’s testimony with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;some of her most interesting questions yet&lt;/a&gt;, grilling Cook on whether in-app game purchases — like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; V-Bucks and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; gold — were effectively subsidizing the rest of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cicn8i"&gt;Rogers doesn’t seem to personally &lt;em&gt;like &lt;/em&gt;video game microtransactions; she’s mused multiple times about potentially predatory impulse buys. But it matters that she singled out games. Epic has pushed to make this suit cover all App Store purchases, while Apple has been trying to limit it to digital video game sales. (That’s why witnesses spent so much time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;trying to define a game&lt;/a&gt;.) Cook’s interrogation suggested that even if iOS stays intact and “gamers” are the only audience in question, Apple still has battles left to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The League of Legends 2021 World Championship will be in Shenzhen, China</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RjUFa0"&gt;The 2021 &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship will be held in Shenzhen, China, &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2021-league-of-legends-worlds-final-date-venue-set/bltb734e254ca2378e3"&gt;Riot Games announced&lt;/a&gt; late Friday. The Worlds Final will be at the Universiade Sports Centre, a 60,000 capacity stadium that’s home to the Shenzhen FC football (soccer) club, on November 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMCgUS"&gt;“We’re extremely excited to push the boundaries of entertainment and sport this year with Worlds 2021 and define the next 10 years of LoL Esports,” John Needham, Global Head of Esports for Riot Games said in a statement. “Shenzhen is China’s most competitive and innovative city with thousands of high-tech startups and entrepreneurial pursuits, so we felt that it was the perfect landscape to host our Finals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HzcYtt"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2021 League of Legends Worlds Final Date, Venue Set&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info: &lt;a href="https://t.co/JBnnoATold"&gt;https://t.co/JBnnoATold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nTIFAMrm5r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nTIFAMrm5r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— LoL Esports (@lolesports) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lolesports/status/1395948350567063555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVV0ek"&gt;The event usually rotates year-by-year among host countries in Asia, North America, and Europe, but 2021 is the second year in a row the event will be held in China. Last year’s finals were a scaled-back event; originally scheduled to take place across several cities in China, it ended up being confined to Shanghai, with players in in a quarantine bubble. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fesports%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F30227558%2Fdamwon-gaming-win-2020-league-legends-world-championship&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F22%2F22448865%2Fleague-of-legends-2021-world-championship-shenzhen-china-esports" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;South Korea’s DAMWON Gaming won&lt;/a&gt; the Summoner’s Cup in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfUe2P"&gt;Details about the early rounds of the tournament are still to come, Riot Games said in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
