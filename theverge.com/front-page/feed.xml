    <title>The Senate’s E-BIKE Act could make electric bikes a lot cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="E-bikes popularity grows" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11eT2n79qkGRUxsgs6AhMjTt38s=/332x0:5027x3130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626458/1311180591.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0RxGd"&gt;A bill that would offer Americans a refundable tax credit on the purchase of a new electric bicycle was just introduced in the Senate by Ed Markey (D-MA) and Brian Schatz (D-HI). The bill is called the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment, or E-BIKE Act for short, and it’s the companion bill to one introduced in the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbH59m"&gt;E-bikes are more expensive than normal bikes, typically costing anywhere from $1,000 to $8,000 for some of the more high-end models. But they also have the potential to replace car trips for a lot of people, with a recent study finding that if 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.bicycling.com_news_a33798099_e-2Dbikes-2Dcan-2Dreduce-2Dcarbon-2Demissions-2Dstudy_-23-3A-7E-3Atext-3DTake-2520an-2520E-252DBike-2520to-2Cemissions-2520would-2520drop-252012-2520percent.-26text-3DResearch-2520from-2520a-2520recent-2520study-2Creducing-2520carbon-2520emissions-2520in-2520cities.&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&amp;amp;r=Kaw85Xe8TfA6OxCjbhxHHlKZN2OTQje-DKAJWPsTvmQ&amp;amp;m=TGIC8E3VcNB9fNV9rlqspnybSAaSvRDYUI4CaLwl9B4&amp;amp;s=pn6j7tb5RRf9wPkw9K3jBBueYbBKOGZTr8pdj7KdhkQ&amp;amp;e="&gt;carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GEAPQk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the electrification of transportation is not just about cars”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ElWXUP"&gt;This afternoon, I conducted a brief interview with Senator Schatz over text message to get a sense of the legislation’s goals, its chances in Congress, and whether he himself would ever consider buying an e-bike. (He said no, but I think I got him to reconsider.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Lhvg"&gt;“The idea is simple,” Schatz said, “the electrification of transportation is not just about cars, it’s about every way to get around.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MN7t2A"&gt;At its core, the bill is about accessibility, the senator said. More people should be riding e-bikes than just those who can afford them. Driving is already highly subsidized across the country. We build cheap — often free — areas for parking, we invest in highways, drivers don’t pay for congestion or CO2 emissions, and zoning laws and taxes favor sprawl. We need to start accommodating bikes — and especially e-bikes — if we want more people to switch to greener forms of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJWBKt"&gt;“The bill makes a clean alternative more accessible to more people,” Schatz said. “E-bikes make lots of sense for working people, young people, and others who either cannot afford or don’t want a car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoPIkN"&gt;Much like the House bill, Schatz and Markey’s legislation would offer Americans a refundable tax credit worth 30 percent of a new e-bike’s purchase price, capped at $1,500. All three e-bike classes would be eligible for the tax credit, but bikes with motors more powerful than 750W would not. The credit would also be fully refundable, which would allow lower-income individuals to claim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NivS6h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A common refrain you hear from critics of this legislation is that people won’t switch to bikes without safer infrastructure to support it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XXRJ62"&gt;A common refrain you hear from critics of this legislation is that people won’t switch to bikes without safer infrastructure to support it. Protected bike lanes are still in short supply in the US, and it’s unclear whether a surge in demand for e-bikes would necessarily lead to better policy decisions on the local level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw39r3"&gt;Schatz said there needs to be a “major infusion of physical infrastructure for bike lanes and safe streets” for this bill to have the desirable outcome, which is more people switching from cars to e-bikes. There is &lt;a href="https://www.peopleforbikes.org/news/what-could-bidens-infrastructure-plan-mean-for-bikes"&gt;$20 billion in President Biden’s infrastructure proposal&lt;/a&gt; for safe street improvements, which include bike lanes. But whether that money survives in the final deal — if there is a final deal — remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMkBns"&gt;“I’m optimistic,” Schatz said about the potential passage of the E-BIKE Act, “but this overall package will face multiple near-death experiences before it becomes law. We plan to get it through in the coming package, but if we don’t, we will keep pushing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HrAg2"&gt;The House version of the bill has 21 co-sponsors — all Democrats — while the Senate version is just now making the rounds. But Schatz said he doesn’t think it will be a tough sell with his colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X1d0Lw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We anticipate that we will be able to build momentum for this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTeLxX"&gt;“We anticipate that we will be able to build momentum for this,” he said. “It’s one of those rare ideas that is both revolutionary and noncontroversial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H47yR5"&gt;And while Schatz said he’s only tried riding an e-bike once, while on vacation, and doesn’t have any immediate plans to buy one for himself, he would reconsider, given his newly acquired position as an advocate for this mode of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztznwM"&gt;Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC, has a number of pedal-assist e-bikes in rotation. Just sayin’. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard exec calls sexual harassment allegations ‘extremely troubling’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uianmWaBQvUiIhudH32jPptAe4c=/106x0:3742x2424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626424/1233534678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A new lawsuit alleges widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard | Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4axai"&gt;The president of Blizzard Entertainment sent an email to staff calling allegations of sexual harassment at the company “extremely troubling.” First reported by Jason Schreier at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, J. Allen Brack wrote that “the fight for equality is incredibly important to me,” and that he has spent his career fighting against “bro culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaRfgc"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;(DFEH) filed suit against Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and owner Activision Blizzard on Tuesday, alleging a culture of “constant sexual harassment” existed at the company.  The complaint describes a “frat boy culture” that included male employees drinking and sexually harassing female employees without repercussions. Brack is named in the complaint as being one of the people at the company who was allegedly aware and enabling of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XPib1p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack sent out an email to staff last night addressing the allegations from this week's explosive lawsuit, calling them "extremely troubling" and saying that he'd be "meeting with many of you to answer questions and discuss how we can move forward." &lt;a href="https://t.co/NsMV6CNdTE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NsMV6CNdTE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418512291218264065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bt8zyB"&gt;According to the DFEH complaint, “male employees would play video games during work, engage in banter about their sexual encounters, talk openly about female bodies, and make numerous jokes about rape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29qX1E"&gt;Women were subjected to numerous sexual advances and comments, the lawsuit states, including groping and other forms of harassment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e1dC9U"&gt;A female employee noted that random male employees would approach her on Defendants’ work site and comment on her breasts. Female employees working for the World of Warcraft team noted that male employees and supervisors would hit on them, make derogatory comments about rape, and otherwise engage in demeaning behavior. This behavior was known to supervisors and indeed encouraged by them, including a male supervisor openly encouraging a male subordinate to “buy” a prostitute to cure his bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2ABhl"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting, his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4rjYuV"&gt;Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend sent an email to staff the same day as Brack, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418619091515068421?s=20"&gt;according to Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, but with a different tone, saying the lawsuit presented an “untrue picture” of the company, adding that it was “meritless.” Her comments echoed an official statement released by the company that called the DFEH lawsuit “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California,” and said the suit included “distorted, and in many cases, false descriptions of Blizzard’s past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIvruf"&gt;Activision Blizzard didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Mario 64 probably won’t be the last million-dollar video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xQOr_3LYR6AultfQV43tpdqyL4Y=/0x15:955x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626180/screenshot01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Super Mario 64. | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD80Lj"&gt;Earlier this month, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; sold for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572688/super-mario-64-most-expensive-video-game-ever-heritage-auctions"&gt;$1,560,000&lt;/a&gt; at auction, a staggering price that nearly doubled a record set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;just two days before by a similarly pristine copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The auctions could mark just the beginning of even more eye-poppingly large video game sales. It seems very likely that Mario’s first 3D adventure won’t be the last game to command a million-dollar sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUpy3B"&gt;“I think we’ll see more million dollar games, probably sooner rather than later,” Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse, a developer that works on rereleases of classic video games, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eDDdt8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Collecting and selling stuff has become a popular trend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9URY8z"&gt;Collecting and selling stuff — both physical and virtual — for expensive prices has become a popular trend. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; cards are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276738/pokemon-trading-card-game-printing-short-supply-high-demand"&gt;massively popular&lt;/a&gt;. Some NFTs, a form of digital collectible, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;sold for millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;. And people have been pouring huge amounts of money into assets like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255955/robinhood-cryptocurrency-restrictions-dogecoin-wallstreetbets"&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop’s stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jS4Nve"&gt;Video games continue to be hugely popular — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;more than half of Americans turned to video games during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; — and retro games have already had a recent history of becoming collectors’ items. Just over a year ago, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; claimed the record of being the most expensive video game ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;by selling for $114,000&lt;/a&gt;, a figure that was huge at the time but is less than a tenth of what &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; just auctioned for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uhAsK"&gt;Kohler expects that the next game to break the million-dollar threshold could be a very early printing of The &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, like what sold this month, or another &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; Danielle Smith, owner of Nerdy Girl Comics, agrees. “I think that the market has kind of spoken for itself and that Mario is king and Zelda is queen of video games,” she said. Smith also said that &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; for the Sega Genesis could potentially be a valuable title. That’s not only because of his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21133092/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-paramount"&gt;cultural cache right now&lt;/a&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; sealed is really hard to come by,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RDgMDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The supply of sealed video games is much lower than many other collectibles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqad2v"&gt;It’s not just &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt;. People who are coming into collecting top-notch games may find that supply is much lower than it is in other collectibles markets. “I think that we are going to continue to see record breaking sales [in games],” said Deniz Kahn, president and founder of Wata Games, the company that evaluated both &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; for quality before they were listed for auction. “At the end of the day, there’s just simply not enough supply of these high end, high grade, sealed, vintage video games to satiate the demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7QKHV"&gt;That’s slightly different than other collectible categories. “Over the last few years there have been a lot of people who have started collecting other areas, like comics or coins or cards, and their markets are very mature,” he said. In comics, “at this point all of the copies of &lt;em&gt;Action Comics #1&lt;/em&gt; have been flushed out of attics into collectors’ hands. People in the [gaming] hobby — collectors, investors — we’re all realizing that the populations of these sealed games are so incredibly low when you compare them to, say, sports cards or comic books,” he added. “There aren’t hundreds of these in high, perfect grade out there. In some cases, there’s one, or 10, or five.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUTa9Z"&gt;Another thing that may be driving up prices is that the games are selling at public auction, meaning that everyone can see the price of an eventual sale. Before that, according to Kahn, “when a five figure video game sale would occur, which was a big deal four or five years ago, I knew about it and maybe 10 other guys knew about it. It all happened behind closed doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C0GIgk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The company that graded the million-dollar copy of Super Mario 64 has a new owner","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577409/wata-games-acquired-collectors-universe-video-game-grading-super-mario-64-legend-of-zelda"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PnGd8U"&gt;All of the recent record holders have been sold on Heritage Auctions, and the games sold have been graded for quality by Wata Games &lt;a href="https://www.watagames.com/what-we-do/wata-scale"&gt;on a 10-point scale&lt;/a&gt; similar to what’s used for comics. According to Kohler, the partnership between Wata and Heritage makes it safer for people to have confidence that the game they’re bidding on is of the quality that’s advertised. “You’re not just buying it from shadyguy123 on eBay,” he said. “You know you’re buying from Heritage Auctions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWJ9XC"&gt;“The sales that occur [on Heritage] are now almost an indicator of health,” Kahn said. “It’s a pulse on the market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52z4cb"&gt;The person who bought the million-dollar &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t come forward publicly, so it’s unclear exactly why they dropped such a huge amount of money on the one game. But Valarie McLeckie, consignment director of video games at Heritage Auctions, said that those who have been buying ultra-rare games are driven by nostalgia. “The types of people who are buying these games are seeking mint-condition examples of the games they played as a kid,” she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVTO1C"&gt;Kahn speculates that for some, Nintendo 64 games may hit that nostalgia sweet spot that encourages them to buy. “I think [for] the generation that’s really heavily getting involved in alternative assets, the Nintendo 64 era, for example, resonates a lot more with that demographic,” he said. “I think that might also be the reason that we’re all very surprised that the first million-dollar-plus video game was a Nintendo 64 game. I don’t think anyone could have predicted that. But it goes to show the power of emotion and nostalgia and how much of a role that plays despite all the other factors that drive demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FLDh3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The high prices could have a positive impact on video game preservation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUp170"&gt;These record-breaking sales could have a positive impact on video game preservation, which is already a challenging problem due to the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516254/video-game-history-foundation-secret-of-monkey-island-code"&gt;technology changes and decays&lt;/a&gt;. If more people try to sell their video games to get in on the market, treasures that had been buried could see the light of day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ2xbw"&gt;“What I think that people do not understand is that so much stuff, even to this day, gets thrown in the trash,” Kohler said. “If there’s one really great beneficial impact that something like this is going to have — especially because it passed that magical million dollar number where everybody, the mainstream news, is all paying attention to it — the beneficial impact this has is [that] fewer people will throw away their video games.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUDfNC"&gt;The best deal available today is on the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 with Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity. Usually $399, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747116002201048292" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $279 at Best Buy through Saturday, July 24th&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is honoring this deal, too, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even going a bit lower with a $265 price&lt;/a&gt; (though, act fast as Amazon’s stock tends to sell out faster than Best Buy’s). The thing is, this price cut is limited to the Product Red colorway that has a red aluminum case and a red sport band. This is great news for people who can’t get enough of the color red in their lives, but it’s probably not most people’s first choice in terms of how they’d like their Apple Watch to look. It’s hard to argue with the price, though. We’ve seen it sell for $20 less than this, but not since late in April. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can pick up a set for $170. These originally sold for $230, but have dropped down to $200 on occasion. This model has active noise cancellation, and their ability to pair with two devices at once via Bluetooth makes them unique among competitors like the AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HDyhWB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5ZGw4"&gt;In other headphone news, if you happen to be in the market for a pair of noise-canceling, wireless headphones that are good, but not too expensive, look no further than Sony’s WH-1000XM3. Their name doesn’t roll off the tongue, but the value at this price is indisputably great. These are comfy, over-ear headphones that sound wonderful and block out all sorts of noise. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;They’re on sale at Best Buy for $170&lt;/a&gt; through Sunday, their most affordable price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="euUcED"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xy3Y8h"&gt;At Best Buy, you can land a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747056866988464304" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complimentary 128GB microSD card when you purchase a Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; at MSRP ($200). That’s a solid promo, as a microSD card is something that a large percentage of Switch owners will likely find themselves in need of quickly. The Switch Lite has 32GB of storage built-in, and that’s only enough for a few games. So, if you’re shopping for a Switch Lite, get it at Best Buy to have this freebie added to your cart at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JxRwjn"&gt;Nomad, a company that makes leather goods to both protect and make your tech look more spiffy, is hosting its summer sale through Sunday.

It’s a fantastic deal for a game of its size and quality, but it’s an even better deal if you were hoping not to shell out the full amount to get the enhanced director’s cut for the PS4 or PS5 when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launches on August 20th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; owners will need to spend $29 to upgrade if playing on either console, so you’ll have spent $60 in total by taking advantage of this deal instead of $70. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhF14P"&gt;Just to let you know up top, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s back-to-school promotion has already kicked off&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. Granted, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out at Apple’s educational storefront. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the model with 128GB of storage. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ipad+2020&amp;amp;qid=1621350979&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSkVCMDZaTjVCV0VFJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDM2OTM2RjNHV0xNUDNHUDk1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyMjg1ODkyMVFXT0lITjVaR0hZJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;latest iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the same A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $399 and $549 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but if you want to buy the 64GB iPad mini right now, it is available for &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$369 in space gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold%2F430392594%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; at Walmart. There is also a sale on the 256GB model, which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $490 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a sizable discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $499 — $100 off the list price — in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-10-9-inch-ipad-air-latest-model-4th-generation-with-wi-fi-64gb-sky-blue%2F5985620.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkBU1gykExnTVM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D5985620&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Both retailers are also currently knocking $100 off the 256GB model with Wi-Fi (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J63W44Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747064649800318667#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), with the former taking an additional &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J6FTH75/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 off the rose gold configuration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-gen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is now widely available, which means there are plenty of deals to be had on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iteration of the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in multiple configurations at Best Buy and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB model is &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/3PjGgM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt;, and the 256GB model is available for $800 at both &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/3PjGgM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The latter retailer is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $1,000 $1,200, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;The same $100 discount at Best Buy applies to the 12.9-inch model, too. If you prefer the Wi-Fi model, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065737279860353#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt; is discounted to $900, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065769538440219#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; to $1,000, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB model&lt;/a&gt; to $1,200, and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB model&lt;/a&gt; to $1,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important thing to you, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to bring about deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — and new features like Center Stage, a software innovation that zooms and pans to keep you centered in the frame while participating in video calls. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If you do want the latest model, however, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $50 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $749. The 12.9-inch model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $999&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeOAFFIkXYozdeIB8E_xA9aqhlg=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/joy_con_01.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — new, preowned, or otherwise — may still occasionally sell out as a result of the pandemic. However, we’ll do our best to keep this article current with the latest in-stock offers. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $314&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to upgrade, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $326&lt;/a&gt; and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $344&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ueoxw3"&gt;You can purchase the updated Nintendo Switch model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VJRZ62R?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red and blue Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $300 at Amazon, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fquery%3Dnintendo%2520switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746299173080046926" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con%2F11095819.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/AomY2j" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="fiSvia"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store, where you can often find refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $260, in addition to most color configurations of the Switch Lite for $170.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The forthcoming Nintendo Switch OLED model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578368/nintendo-switch-oled-preorder-time-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;opened for preorders on July 15th&lt;/a&gt;, with the initial preorder stock selling out within minutes. The higher-end Switch model — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially goes on sale on October 8th&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AJPPsv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sxXvjE"&gt;Although preorders for both models have come and gone since initially opening, as of the time of this writing, both configurations of the Nintendo Switch OLED are unavailable for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $60&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, both &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have the Switch Pro controller for $59, knocking $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlFlVd"&gt;Right now, Eneba offers a discounted &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year, individual membership for around $19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus’ Passthrough API will enable experiences that mix VR and the real world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cqku3DlViVzU8OmWZJ4DFXr9n0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624661/akrales_200904_4160_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="399LsB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/"&gt;Facebook announced&lt;/a&gt; a new API that will let developers incorporate video from the Quest 2’s sensors into their games and applications, creating a mixed reality experience. With the Passthrough API, developers will not only be able to mix the black-and-white images from the headset’s sensors into their experiences, but they’ll also be able to customize how it ends up looking to the player, apply effects, and even have the real world show up on specific surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NSqs5"&gt;Facebook’s announcement includes examples of how the API could improve productivity software by allowing integration of real-life keyboards and desks, and how games could include your real-life furniture for enemies to hide behind. It’s also easy to imagine other fun experiences that mix your real environment with a virtual world — how about Portal-esque puzzles that you solve in your own house, or the ability to see your walls covered in virtual paint?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An example of mixed reality controls." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VLYYJaWFjvYQPbQDrWogK9LJpsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22736678/ezgif_4_4144a1fef0c8.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Oculus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of mixed reality controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hffGQP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/mixed-realiy-passthrough-api/"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the API was currently only for the Quest 2 when asked about compatibility with the first-generation Quest. In the announcement post, Facebook says the image processing for the API is done on-device and that applications using it won’t be able to see or store the images from the Quest 2’s sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrUCbu"&gt;Facebook is adding the experimental version of the API to its upcoming developer tools, and it’ll be available first to programmers using Unity to build their software. Facebook does promise that the API will be getting support for other development platforms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3KhDOR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A virtual office in your real office&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6VYT12"&gt;The Quest, Quest 2, and Rift S headsets &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/what-is-passthrough"&gt;already have a version of the Passthrough technology&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users get a quick look at what’s happening around them in the real world. Facebook also lets you &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-passthrough-home/"&gt;set Passthrough as your virtual environment&lt;/a&gt;, giving you a version of your real environment (albeit in black and white) that you can navigate the Oculus UI in. It even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_bVkbG1ZCo"&gt;showed off that ability&lt;/a&gt; in a video about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382805/oculus-quest-2-facebook-wireless-pc-streaming-120hz-infinite-office"&gt;its Infinite Office feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zNNybS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_bVkbG1ZCo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m03nkG"&gt;The ability to integrate your real environment into a virtual world has long been one of the more exciting promises of headsets with integrated cameras. Microsoft even invoked the idea when it named its VR platform Windows Mixed Reality (regardless of how much that’s actually been delivered on). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgVHIA"&gt;The news of Oculus’ API doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to pick up your headset and have a mixed reality experience today, however. &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/"&gt;In its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook says it’s looking to let developers ship software using Passthrough to players “later this year.” Still, this API’s availability to developers is exciting, as it should allow for new types of experiences on the Oculus platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NSO’s Pegasus spyware: here’s what we know</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9CVHZQ"&gt;Throughout the past week, we’ve seen story after story about a company called NSO Group, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;a piece of spyware called Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the stories have been shocking, with allegations that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;fully updated smartphones can be hacked with a single text message&lt;/a&gt;, and reports that two women close to murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/jamal-khashoggi-wife-fiancee-cellphone-hack/"&gt;were among those targeted&lt;/a&gt; by a government agency using the spy tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zewapH"&gt;A coalition of news outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; is behind the reporting, and they’re calling it the Pegasus Project. The project was led by Forbidden Stories, an organization of journalists that works on stories after the original reporters have been silenced in some way. Amnesty International &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;ran detailed forensics&lt;/a&gt; on 67 smartphones to look for evidence that they were targeted by Pegasus spyware — and 37 of those phones tested positive. But many crucial details still aren’t clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxXEFq"&gt;Here’s what we know about the NSO Group and Pegasus so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="CFiMw7"&gt;What is Pegasus, and who or what is NSO Group?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="BlqAJm"&gt;Pegasus is spyware developed by a private contractor for use by government agencies. The program infects a target’s phone and sends back data, including photos, messages, and audio / video recordings. Pegasus’ developer, an Israeli company called NSO Group, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; the software can’t be traced back to the government using it — a crucial feature for clandestine operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVwEQW"&gt;In short, NSO Group makes products that let governments spy on citizens. The company describes the role of its products on its website as helping “government intelligence and law-enforcement agencies use technology to meet the challenges of encryption” during terrorism and criminal investigations. But as you might imagine, civil liberties groups aren’t happy about the spyware-for-hire business, and restricting the business to government clients does little to quiet their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zUPJa"&gt;The company told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it works only with government agencies, and &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;that it will cut off an agency’s access&lt;/a&gt; to Pegasus if it finds evidence of abuse. In &lt;a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ReportBooklet.pdf"&gt;its transparency report&lt;/a&gt; released at the end of June, the company claimed it has done that before. Still, an Amnesty International statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1418212758185648146/photo/2"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that the company is providing spyware to oppressive governments, where government agencies can’t be trusted to do right by their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwzVSa"&gt;The Forbidden Stories&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;organization, which helped lead the Pegasus Project’s efforts, &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;has a write-up&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s exploits and controversies over the past decade, some of which have inspired lawsuits from journalists and activists arguing that NSO’s software has been used improperly. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/"&gt;has an interview&lt;/a&gt; that covers the company’s own story about how it was founded and how it got started in the surveillance industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Tp0mIV"&gt;Who was being spied on?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tRH8HB"&gt;We don’t know for sure. However, much of the reporting centers around &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;a list containing 50,000 phone numbers&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose of which is unclear. The Pegasus Project analyzed the numbers on the list and linked over 1,000 of them to their owners. When it did so, it found people who should’ve been off-limits to governmental spying (based on &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;the standards NSO says it holds its clients to&lt;/a&gt;): hundreds of politicians and government workers — &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/"&gt;including three presidents, 10 prime ministers, and a king&lt;/a&gt; — plus 189 journalists, and 85 human rights activists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="wVZNPh"&gt;Wait, who made this list?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="48fNZu"&gt;At this point, that’s clear as mud. NSO says the list has nothing to do with its business, &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;and claims&lt;/a&gt; it’s from a simple database of cellular numbers that’s a feature of the global cellular network. A statement from an Amnesty International spokesperson, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1418212758185648146/photo/1"&gt;posted to Twitter by cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter&lt;/a&gt;, says that the list indicates numbers that were marked as “of interest” to NSO’s various clients. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; says that the list is from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2DDdx6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amnesty says the Israeli media mis-reported a statement it gave them in Hebrew about the list of 50,000 phone numbers. See here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/rhksVHineG"&gt;https://t.co/rhksVHineG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I obtained the full Hebrew statement they gave reporters, and the Israeli media quoted it correctly. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9JNmwC3QW4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9JNmwC3QW4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kim Zetter (@KimZetter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1418212758185648146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mPmb5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; says the list doesn’t contain information about who added numbers to it, or whether people linked to the numbers were under surveillance. Was the list curated by a shadowy government agency trying to get on the good side of other governments? Was it maintained by a Slack group of Pegasus users? Was it simply a list of numbers? It’s an essential question that remains frustratingly unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pdyF1s"&gt;So does the list matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="HroP2i"&gt;It seems to. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that some of the phones analyzed were targeted shortly after they were added to the list. In some cases, only a few seconds separate timestamps that indicate when the phone number was added to the list and incidents of Pegasus attacks on the phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tukWMn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/spyware-leak-suggests-lawyers-and-activists-at-risk-across-globe"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amnesty ran its analysis on 67 phones connected to the numbers. It found that 37 of the phones had been at least targeted by Pegasus, and that 23 of those phones had been successfully hacked. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;details how Pegasus was used&lt;/a&gt; to hack a phone belonging to the wife of an imprisoned activist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7FWyvr"&gt;Who else is on the list?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="alsC5x"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; report &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/"&gt;details some of the highest-ranking officials with numbers on the list&lt;/a&gt;. According to an analysis done by the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;and other Pegasus Project members, the current presidents of France, Iraq, and South Africa were included, along with the current prime ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, and Morocco, seven former prime ministers, and the king of Morocco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXlLeL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/dubai-princesses-spyware/"&gt;A separate report&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; claims that the Moroccan king was not the only royalty whose number appeared on the list — a princess from Dubai was also added, along with some of her friends, as she was trying to gain political asylum. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56085369"&gt;Her attempt failed&lt;/a&gt; when she was allegedly kidnapped by armed commandos who boarded the yacht she was using to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDeHq5"&gt;Also on the list were two women close to Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399"&gt;who was murdered in 2018.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EECTmO"&gt;Was Khashoggi himself on the list?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="Aq6mJJ"&gt;It doesn’t seem so (though we’ll deal with some nuances in a moment), but people close to him were. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; has reported that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/jamal-khashoggi-wife-fiancee-cellphone-hack/"&gt;one of those hacked phones belonged to Khashoggi’s fiancé&lt;/a&gt;, and that there’s reportedly evidence that his wife’s phone was targeted as well. NSO’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;has strongly denied&lt;/a&gt; that Khashoggi’s wife was a target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8pPUL"&gt;As to whether NSO targeted Khashoggi himself, that’s a question without a definite answer. NSO strongly denies that it was involved — it &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;did so in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and again recently, with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; citing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/07/18/nso-group-response-pegasus-project/"&gt;a statement from the company&lt;/a&gt; that its technology “was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi.” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/jamal-khashoggi-wife-fiancee-cellphone-hack/"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khashoggi’s phone is in the custody of Turkish authorities who are carrying out an investigation of the journalist’s homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ZIiQSs"&gt;What does Pegasus &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ldg74i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the spyware can steal private data from a phone, sending a target’s messages, passwords, contacts, photos, and more to whoever initiated the surveillance. It can reportedly even turn on the phone’s cameras or microphones to create covert recordings. A &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;document from NSO&lt;/a&gt; describes the software’s capabilities in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYgid0"&gt;Recent versions of it have reportedly been able to do this without having to get the user to do anything — a link is sent to their phone, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;without a notification&lt;/a&gt;, and Pegasus starts collecting information. In other cases, Pegasus has reportedly &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;relied on users to click phishing links&lt;/a&gt; that then deliver the Pegasus payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="59o9XX"&gt;Wait, how can Pegasus get all that info?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qNOngv"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have articles explaining how even modern phones with the latest software updates can be exploited. (&lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;Amnesty has shown&lt;/a&gt; that even some of the most recent versions of iOS are vulnerable to methods used by NSO.) The summary is that no software is perfect. Where there’s complicated software, like iMessage or WhatsApp, there will be bugs, and some of those bugs will give hackers access to way more than many would think is possible. And, with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/technology/nso-group-how-spy-tech-firms-let-governments-see-everything-on-a-smartphone.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;millions of dollars at stake&lt;/a&gt;, hackers and security researchers are very motivated to find those bugs, even if they’ll only be usable for a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ntZHPI"&gt;It can do all that on iPhones? What about Apple’s security and privacy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="RZh3MB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple didn’t deny NSO’s capability to exploit iPhones, instead saying that attacks like Pegasus are “highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals,” thereby not affecting most Apple customers. Apple did say that it continues “to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJAsfp"&gt;Still, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; points out,&lt;/a&gt; the fact that the iPhone could be so thoroughly compromised by a reportedly invisible message is unfortunate for a company that prides itself on security and privacy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;one that put up&lt;/a&gt; “what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone” billboards. Security researchers who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;mainly lay the blame on iMessage and its preview software — despite &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/28/apple-adopts-new-blastdoor-security-system-on-ios-14-to-reinforce-imessage-integrity/"&gt;the protections that Apple has reportedly implemented recently&lt;/a&gt; to try to secure iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="TPfDyh"&gt;Are only iPhones vulnerable?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="nxBmk0"&gt;No. A lot of the reporting focuses on iPhones, but that’s only because they’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;proven easier to analyze&lt;/a&gt; for signs of a Pegasus infection than Android phones have. Pegasus can, however, infect both, according to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;an NSO informational document&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have commented on the situation, with Apple condemning attacks against journalists and activists, and Google saying that it warns users of attempted infiltrations, even those backed by governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pzYh5x"&gt;I think I’ve heard of Pegasus before?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="o0JeuY"&gt;The spyware has been in the news for years, often in connection with incidents similar to what’s currently being reported. In 2017, reports surfaced that the software had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15828934/spyware-nso-group-mexico-journalists-activists-citizen-lab"&gt;been used in attacks against Mexican reporters and activists&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;sued NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the software developer was involved in the hacking of around 1,400 devices using an exploit found in WhatsApp’s code. Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and other tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22194930/microsoft-google-cisco-vmware-internet-association-amicus-brief-nso-group-spyware-whatsapp-facebook"&gt;signaled support&lt;/a&gt; for WhatsApp’s suit. (As of April 2021, the case was ongoing, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/12/nso-falters-lawsuit-whatsapp-hacking-481073"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDw84P"&gt;In 2020, it was reported that NSO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117180/fbi-bezos-hack-amazon-saudi-arabia-nso"&gt;was being investigated by the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, in connection with the 2018 hack of Jeff Bezos’ cellphone. At the time, NSO denied knowledge of the FBI’s probe, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-nso-exclusive/exclusive-fbi-probes-use-of-israeli-firms-spyware-in-personal-and-government-hacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZT38B"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the FBI recently &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/nso-business-us/"&gt;declined to comment about the matter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ABULcc"&gt;Who’s behind the targeting of activists and journalists?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="7oE3uZ"&gt;We don’t know at the moment, but it’s likely not just one government agency or country. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;points to a list of 10 countries&lt;/a&gt; where many of the phone numbers on the list seem to be from, and says that those countries have been reported to have worked with NSO in the past. But the fact that many of the basic facts about the list remain disputed means there’s really not enough information to draw solid conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="2ePUk2"&gt;How much does it cost to spy on a phone?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6oaDe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NSO reportedly provides bulk discounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuZi5"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/technology/nso-group-how-spy-tech-firms-let-governments-see-everything-on-a-smartphone.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that NSO Group charged $500,000 to set a client up with the Pegasus system, and then charged an additional fee to actually infiltrate people’s phones. At the time, the costs were reportedly $650,000 to hack 10 iPhone or Android users, or $500,000 to infiltrate five BlackBerry users. Clients could then pay more to target additional users, saving as they spy with bulk discounts: $800,000 for an additional 100 phones, $500,000 for an extra 50 phones, and so on. NSO would also reportedly charge 17 percent of what the clients had paid over the course of a year as an annual maintenance fee. &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;According to Forbidden Stories&lt;/a&gt;, NSO’s contract with Saudi Arabia alone is worth up to $55 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tSHBVU"&gt;What does NSO say about the reports?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="e4gW0C"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NSO Group’s CEO and co-founder Shalev Hulio broadly denied the allegations, claiming that the list of numbers had nothing to do with Pegasus or NSO. He argued that a list of phone numbers targeted by Pegasus (which NSO &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/18/reactions-pegasus-project-nso/"&gt;says it doesn’t keep&lt;/a&gt;, as it has “no insight” into what investigations are being carried out by its clients) would be much shorter — he told &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt; that NSO’s 45 clients average about 100 Pegasus targets per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0vw0rI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Somebody has to do the dirty work”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYNqtI"&gt;Hulio also claims that NSO has investigated its clients’ use of the software, and hasn’t found evidence that they targeted any of the phone numbers NSO had been given, including the one linked to Khashoggi’s wife. He also says that it’s NSO policy to cut off clients’ access to Pegasus if it discovers that they are using the system outside of its intended use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFz4Sq"&gt;Hulio &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/18/reactions-pegasus-project-nso/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the reports were “concerning,” and that the company would investigate. He told &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt; that NSO had been running checks with present and past clients for the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="wNavpp"&gt;How would NSO know whether these people have been targeted, or keep them from being targeted, if it has no idea who its clients are targeting?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cHeUMq"&gt;Great question. Hulio tries to answer it &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;in his interview with &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mentioning an ability to analyze a client’s systems, but doesn’t really provide enough detail to be reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7JMWHE"&gt;Also, how does Hulio’s claim of Pegasus clients having an average of 100 targets a year square with the bulk discounts NSO reportedly provides?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="7K8vJM"&gt;Again, great question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vvdyaj"&gt;Why make software like this? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qNTWhb"&gt;According to NSO, it builds Pegasus solely for use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/"&gt;reportedly only sells the software&lt;/a&gt; to specific government agencies that have been approved by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hIIVi"&gt;NSO seems to see its software as a necessary, if unpleasant, part of modern surveillance, with its CEO &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “somebody has to do the dirty work” and that Pegasus is “used to handle literally the worst this planet has to offer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="u5UieI"&gt;Are there other companies out there making tools like Pegasus?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ANh1bh"&gt;Absolutely. &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/spyware-for-sale-the-booming-trade-in-surveillance-tech-like-pegasus/articleshow/84648872.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economic Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a good rundown of some of the higher-profile companies working in the space, along with an explanation of how the pattern of Israeli cyberintelligence agents leaving military service and founding startups leads to Israel being the home of many of these companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="adfVTt"&gt;What can I do to keep myself safe and my information private?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="J9A4Ep"&gt;Despite Amnesty’s report that versions of iOS from July are vulnerable to Pegasus, keeping your phone up to date will ensure that your phone is susceptible to fewer exploits, as updates are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417984/ios-14-5-1-ipad-iphone-apple-watch-mac-update-security-fix"&gt;continually patched out by phone manufacturers.&lt;/a&gt; There’s also the standard set of security best practices: using strong, unique passwords (preferably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;with a password manager&lt;/a&gt;), turning on encryption, not clicking on links from strangers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxYjEr"&gt;Of course, Pegasus has been shown to bypass most of these security measures — a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;leaked copy of NSO informational material&lt;/a&gt; brags that installation “cannot be prevented by the target” — but they will help protect you from less sophisticated hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sa9LQ7"&gt;How can I check if my phone was compromised? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3DHmg1"&gt;Amnesty International has actually released a tool that can be used for analysis, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587234/amnesty-international-nso-pegasus-spyware-detection-tool-ios-android-guide-windows-mac"&gt;read our guide on how to use it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="naSvZy"&gt;How worried should I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; be?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="oTxWhA"&gt;Assuming you’re not a journalist working on sensitive stories, a world leader, or in some position that could threaten governmental powers, the odds are that someone hasn’t paid thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to target you with Pegasus. That said, it’s obviously concerning that these types of attacks are possible, and that they could potentially fall into the hands of hackers looking to target a much broader range of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZO0N8"&gt;As with all security-related measures, it’s important to be realistic about the threats that you’re facing, and what you should do about them. For most people who aren’t likely to be targeted by an actor on the level of a nation-state (which hopefully includes you), the bigger threat to privacy comes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"&gt;data brokers&lt;/a&gt;, which operate legally and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;at a larger scale&lt;/a&gt;. On the flip side, if you actually &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;being targeted by governments, with all the resources at their disposal, there’s probably not a whole lot you can do to keep your digital data private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1vhNbX"&gt;I’ve heard the software can’t be used against people with +1 country code numbers, like those found in the US or Canada.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="OQJB3G"&gt;NSO has claimed many times that the software is technically incapable of targeting phones with US +1 phone numbers. This, of course, doesn’t protect &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/19/us-phone-numbers-nso/"&gt;Americans who are using international phone numbers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also something that’s hard for the company to actually prove. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the investigation didn’t find evidence that any American numbers had been hacked, but they only checked 67 phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYK8pg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes#Zone_1:_North_American_Numbering_Plan"&gt;rest of the countries&lt;/a&gt; using the +1 code at the start of their phone numbers, such as Canada, Jamaica, and others, are largely unmentioned in the new wave of NSO reporting, though Canada was mentioned &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/"&gt;in a 2018 report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Europa Clipper will fly on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nb1BN1zYIfOZVCUuPBu-8Pbt2x0=/0x892:8352x6460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624179/PIA20025_orig.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y82nJ5"&gt;NASA’s &lt;a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/"&gt;Europa Clipper&lt;/a&gt; will start its journey to Jupiter’s icy moon aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket built by SpaceX. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-the-europa-clipper-mission"&gt;NASA will pay SpaceX $178 million&lt;/a&gt; to launch the vehicle in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXHqTs"&gt;The Europa Clipper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/18/8803679/NASA-Europa-clipper-mission-development-phase"&gt;got the green light from NASA in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. It will fly by the moon 45 times, providing researchers with a tantalizing look at the icy world, believed to have an ocean lurking under its icy crust. The Clipper is equipped with instruments that will help scientists figure out if the moon could support life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx9QMy"&gt;For years, the Clipper was legally obligated to launch on NASA’s long-delayed Space Launch System (SLS). But with the SLS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;perpetually delayed and over budget&lt;/a&gt;, NASA has urged Congress to consider allowing the Europa Clipper to fly commercial. Switching to another vehicle could save up to $1 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836550/nasa-europa-clipper-space-launch-system-rocket-inspector-general-falcon-heavy-delta-iv"&gt;NASA’s inspector general said in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGwnvk"&gt;NASA got permission to consider commercial alternatives to the SLS in the 2021 budget, and started officially &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-use-commercial-launch-vehicle-for-europa-clipper/"&gt;looking for a commercial alternative soon after&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUHeeL"&gt;The SLS has powerful allies in Congress, who have kept the costly program alive for years, even as it blew past budgets and deadlines. The first flight of the SLS was originally supposed to happen in 2017. That mission — launching an uncrewed trip around the Moon — has since been pushed to &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-artemis-1-sls-moon-rocket-stacked-photos"&gt;November 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and keeping to that new schedule remains “&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson-space-priorities"&gt;highly unlikely&lt;/a&gt;” according to NASA’s Office of Inspector General, a watchdog agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmuqJY"&gt;SpaceX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16971200/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-success-roadster-orbit-elon-musk"&gt;first launched its Falcon Heavy rocket&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and started flying satellites in 2019. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276731/nasa-picks-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-two-key-pieces-lunar-gateway"&gt;NASA selected the rocket&lt;/a&gt; as the ride to space for two parts of a planned space station orbiting the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvSEh8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian raises another $2.5 billion as it looks to build a second factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/erm7xAkzk87V6T4xwKsMHt-F70E=/0x1:2879x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624133/rivian_r1t_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkOa1w"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Rivian has raised another massive round of funding, this time to the tune of $2.5 billion, bringing its total raised to date over the $10 billion mark. The funding round comes as Rivian recently confirmed it’s looking for a location to build a second factory — one that will also produce batteries for its vehicles — in the United States. The company is currently aiming to roll its first electric pickup trucks off the line at its existing factory in Illinois this September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsnBtD"&gt;The new round was led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Ford, D1 Capital Partners, and funds advised by T. Rowe Price, each of which are already investors in Rivian. Amazon and Ford each own &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;more than 10 percent of the buzzy EV startup&lt;/a&gt;, and are working with Rivian on separate vehicles: Rivian is building delivery vans for Amazon, and is developing a vehicle with Ford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOPlpg"&gt;Rivian was supposed to put its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV into production in 2020, but delayed to 2021 after the pandemic hit. A targeted June start date for pickup production slipped to July, before getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;delayed again until September&lt;/a&gt;. The SUV will now enter production sometime soon after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zubpw5"&gt;As if getting three vehicles into production (not including the one with Ford, which is still in development) at roughly the same time isn’t challenging or expensive enough, Rivian confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;this week that it’s scouting locations for a second assembly plant, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/rivian-us-plant/exclusive-amazon-backed-rivian-confirms-plan-for-second-u-s-assembly-plant-idUSL1N2OX2H4"&gt;where it plans to also make battery cells&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple states are bidding on the new plant, according to the report. The company now employs some 7,000 people. Rivian is also working on an initial public offering, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters?sref=DWzi38c2"&gt;multiple reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhIBg6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
