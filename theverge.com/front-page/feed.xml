    <title>Samsung’s new partnership offers another glimpse of a drone delivery future — in only one Irish town</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAY14iVHmUCSpfKcSSfpiJLH7Mg=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027606/Samsung_Partners_With_Manna_DL4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2lV8E"&gt;In Oranmore, a small town in County Galway, Ireland, you can now get a taste of a possible, instantly-gratifying drone delivery future. In &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-partners-with-manna-to-launch-drone-delivery-service-to-irish-customers"&gt;a newly announced partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Irish drone delivery company &lt;a href="https://www.manna.aero/"&gt;Manna&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is promising delivery of its smaller electronics like phones and smart watches “within three minutes” when ordered by someone in Oranmore from Samsung’s Irish online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdPb8G"&gt;Manna uses “custom-developed aerospace drones” to complete deliveries, according to Samsung’s announcement. The drones’ ability to travel at speeds over 60 kilometers per hour (around 37 miles per hour) seems to be what guarantees those aggressive delivery times, though only operating within a two-kilometer radius from their dispatch center probably helps too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sq9rv"&gt;Samsung and Manna aren’t exactly breaking new ground with their partnership, however. People living in Oranmore may already be familiar with Manna’s drones delivering everything from groceries to medicine thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/tesco-takes-to-the-skies-with-home-delivery-by-drone-1.4391566"&gt;a deal Manna secured&lt;/a&gt; with grocery chain Tesco in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KJchlOt6_i10txkPVJn386wtC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397853/Samsung_Partners_With_Manna_DL3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Samsung phone getting packaged for shipping with a Manna drone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GyLC3s"&gt;Both Samsung and Manna say they’re “keen” to expand the delivery service nationwide, but outside of Ireland other companies have been experimenting with drones as well. Amazon began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13952240/amazon-drone-delivery-launch-uk"&gt;testing its drones in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; after receiving regulatory approval in 2016. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has also started giving out approval for other small scale tests, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238196/ups-cvs-drone-delivery-medicine-florida-coronavirus"&gt;a UPS and CVS partnership&lt;/a&gt; to deliver prescriptions to a retirement home in Florida, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430280/walmart-drone-delivery-pilot-program-north-carolina-flytrex"&gt;a Walmart-run test in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coPP1Y"&gt;All of these tests seem to be in service of what’s starting to feel like an inevitable reality: next-day shipping becoming more like next-minute shipping. Regulators need to agree on standards for drone flights to make that happen, and in the case of the FAA, freedom to fly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;will require new identification systems&lt;/a&gt; to determine ownership. It can all seem like a long way off given the pace of government, but like this Samsung stunt, there are more and more examples where that possible future is bleeding into the present.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes or no: Are these tech hearings doing anything?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Committees Confront Tech CEOs Over Online Spread Of False Info" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RyefwW4MWYpbjLOIhw67piqgx0k=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027536/1231932296.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kKN7vs"&gt;In the middle of Congress’ first hearing of the year with the chief executives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter on Thursday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted out a poll. It was just a question mark with two answers: yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtAqea"&gt;It was an obvious troll directed at the lawmakers questioning Dorsey, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai over the roles their platforms have played in spreading misinformation and inciting a violent insurrection at the US Capitol earlier this year. With limited time for questioning, the members would interrupt the CEOs’ responses, asking for “yes” or “no” answers or nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SovYDa"&gt;But while the hearing was focused on finding solutions for some of the most serious free speech conflicts in history, Dorsey’s tweet symbolized just how seriously everyone was taking it — not very seriously at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tNxSio"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@jack&lt;/a&gt; trolling a member of Congress who asked CEOs to affirm they know the different between "yes" &amp;amp; "no" &lt;a href="https://t.co/yGrhPNy5G1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yGrhPNy5G1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cristiano Lima (@viaCristiano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1375152822581403655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JHFJPx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LuUGgf"&gt;It’s not the first time Zuckerberg, Dorsey, and Pichai have testified before Congress. But it was the first time they were hauled in after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol on January 6th, killing multiple people. QAnon followers and right-wing online influencers were just some of the individuals who participated in the attack which was largely organized and live-streamed on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erIJsm"&gt;Ahead of the hearing, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/morningtech/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“This is not a hearing just to hear the same old thing.” He continued, “We want to know what we can do legislatively. We want to pass laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bj3kf0"&gt;But even after a direct affront to democracy, lawmakers were unorganized, making comments about cancel culture, Mr. Potato Head, and conflating competition, privacy, and moderation into a huge unsolvable problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnFHsL"&gt;In the lead-up to Thursday’s hearing, only one lawmaker, Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), introduced legislation, the “Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act.” And Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) held an event to discuss Section 230 reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slquQv"&gt;But after the hearing, it doesn’t seem as if the House has moved any closer to drafting real legislative reforms. In other words, Congress has failed to move past airing their personal grievances and toward providing real solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9myfC"&gt;In some cases, lawmakers were asking the tech executives to do more than they’re able to achieve themselves. Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA) pushed the executives on the rise of anti-Asian violence and hate speech. But as rightly pointed out by my boss Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1375146987381788675?s=20"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the US doesn’t have any hate speech policies and it would be difficult to get any related bill passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wuLq0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bills have prompted tech companies to take action themselves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YD1JUY"&gt;In the past, bills have prompted tech companies to take action themselves. After the 2016 presidential election, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mark Warner (D-VA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502946/facebook-twitter-russia-honest-ads-act"&gt;introduced the Honest Ads Act&lt;/a&gt;. The bill was never passed, but it pressured Facebook and Google to host their own transparent ads databases. But when it comes to content moderation and Section 230 reform, Facebook, Google, and Twitter are largely opposed to any significant changes to the law. Any meaningful reform will need to come from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCpfP4"&gt;Shortly after the January 6th attack, Warner, Klobuchar, and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268368/democrats-section-230-moderation-warner-klobuchar-facebook-google"&gt;introduced the SAFE TECH Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would open new pathways for users to sue tech companies if content posted on their platforms threatens them personally with harassment, discrimination, or other forms of abuse. The Eshoo bill would remove immunity under Section 230 when a platform’s algorithm is proved to have promoted or recommended content related to terrorist acts or civil rights violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK7hoV"&gt;Still, neither of those bills have received a hearing or much bipartisan support. In the Senate, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) will be chairing the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on privacy and technology. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/19/one-on-one-with-biden-ally-and-tech-leader-chris-coons-794105"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month, Coons said that, in some cases, Congress doing nothing is a better option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="GvVhm0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But when do hearings fail to force the change Congress says it wants?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SENuo4"&gt;“In an area where technology is moving fairly quickly, sometimes oversight hearings, letters [and] conversations with the leaders of major social media companies can result in those companies demonstrably changing their practices faster than we can legislate,” Coons told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo7GNr"&gt;But when do hearings fail to force the change Congress says it wants? On Thursday, it seemed like we were quickly approaching that threshold. From Zuckerberg and Pichai, little new information was uncovered. Dorsey favorited tweets and sent out silly polls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cc8Tvo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zlML9i"&gt;Coons told &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;that his Senate Judiciary panel plans on hauling these executives back for another hearing sometime in the future. But it’s not clear when that will happen. Most action on tech reform is likely to come from the House Judiciary Committee. Last week, that committee finished up its final antitrust hearing on tech. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html"&gt;Chairman Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to expect a deluge of competition bills in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VI6E2S"&gt;“My strategy is you’ll see a number of bills introduced, both because it’s harder for [the tech companies] to manage and oppose, you know, 10 bills as opposed to one,” Cicilline told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg95Bg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjKngx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppMGPT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla has to tell Elon Musk to delete a 2018 tweet, labor board rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="elon-musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jupsKoznhcSPwfsLDLilvrsHQUs=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027484/musk7.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htLjCJ"&gt;Tesla must tell CEO Elon Musk to delete an anti-union tweet from 2018, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) decided Thursday. The order came as part of Tesla’s appeal of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887897/tesla-elon-musk-tweets-union-nlrb-illegal"&gt;2019 ruling by an administrative judge&lt;/a&gt; in a years-long legal battle between the company and the United Auto Workers union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo8zCj"&gt;Below is Musk’s tweet in question, which is included as a screen instead of a Twitter embed in case the tweet is deleted. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808"&gt;This is the direct link to the tweet&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dmatkins137/status/998451424546570242"&gt;was in response to this tweet&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to see the conversation in context on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JE-QRjts0jhrWnMPC8A5fIpDmMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22398063/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_2.07.21_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fie2x0"&gt;Tesla will also have to post a notice at its factories nationwide addressing the “unlawful tweet.” This is actually a change from the decision from the 2019 ruling, where Musk or someone with the labor board would have been required to read a notice that Tesla violated the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4c80DQ"&gt;“Here, a notice-reading remedy is neither necessary nor appropriate to remedy the violations in this case because the Board’s traditional remedies will suffice to ameliorate the chilling effect of the Respondent’s unlawful conduct,” the NLRB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmwdtG"&gt;The appeal also included a number of other orders for Tesla. Notably, Tesla employees are allowed to have conversations with the media that are protected by the National Labor Relations Act without asking for approval. Previously, employees had language in their confidentiality agreement that said they couldn’t talk to the media without authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGWCtG"&gt;You can download the full decision &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-197020"&gt;from the NLRB’s website&lt;/a&gt; or read it embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Etsy is surrounding ‘Asian’ listings with erotic photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Etsy stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gtv3IIo18er13j7gyAs3l8r4khs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027440/etsy17_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbqDuW"&gt;Etsy shoppers browsing the site for Asian artwork this afternoon may been greeted with something else: recommendations for topless photos of Asian women. The issue was first pointed out by an Asian American artist on Twitter, who &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is not naming due to harassment concerns, who had erotica recommended above one of their listings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riqJUY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;was able to find several listings where Etsy placed recommendations for erotic photos of Asian women above or below entirely unrelated products with “Asian” in the title. A cute black-and-white illustration of a girl in bed has a row of erotic photos placed above it as recommendations. A collage of illustrations of Asian women has a section beneath it titled “You may also like” that features two rows primarily containing erotic photos of Asian women. A listing for “Asian Beauty” photo filters includes a suggested row beneath it for “asian women bikini,” which also includes an erotic photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I40sXO"&gt;The issue spills out into searches on the site. Searches for “Asian photo” or “Asian women photo” deliver results featuring a number of erotic images, whereas searches for other races or skin tones do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHLIMK"&gt;Etsy removed the erotic photos from three listings after being contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jvnuz"&gt;“We began working to correct this issue as soon as it was brought to our attention,” an Etsy spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have added new controls around the types of listings that surface as recommendations. We will continue to work on improving our algorithm to avoid surfacing recommendations where not relevant or appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kN8MWM"&gt;After a white man in Atlanta killed eight people including six Asian women earlier this month, there’s been widespread discussion around the fetishization of Asian women in America. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/opinion/hollywood-complicit-violence-against-asians-in-america-1234932858/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about Hollywood’s decades-long role in depicting Asian women as sex workers. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22338807/asian-fetish-racism-atlanta-shooting"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vox &lt;/em&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; to a scholar about the history of the hyper-sexualization of Asian women, including a federal law used to discriminate against Asian women under the pretense of preventing sex work. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/17/us/asian-women-misogyny-spa-shootings-trnd/index.html"&gt;And CNN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about how that history makes Asian women “uniquely vulnerable to violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ehng8F"&gt;The reflection comes during a spike in anti-Asian attacks in the United States. Earlier this month, the group Stop AAPI Hate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/us/hate-crimes-against-asian-americans-community.html"&gt;reported 3,800 hate incidents&lt;/a&gt; over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxdDct"&gt;Etsy CEO Josh Silverman wrote last week that Etsy “stand[s] united with the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.” Silverman said Etsy planned to offer bystander training to all of its US employees, work with its Asian Employee Resource Community “to amplify AAPI voices,” and donate $500,000 to two groups supporting AAPI rights and justice. Etsy also vowed to continue monitoring its marketplace for items that “promote hate or violence.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original Ninja Gaiden Black and II code has apparently been lost, so you’re getting Sigma</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ninja Gaiden Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yBEuOkOQB-4ucL8rELLRtLNLTOE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027031/ae016fda_8fb5_4bf2_9212_93ab0524d758.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A still captured from Ninja Gaiden Black running on the Xbox One X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9H6Maq"&gt;People who missed out on the first 3D-action &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; games released in the aughts (and that other one that we don’t really talk about from 2012) will have a chance to play all three this coming June in &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection&lt;/em&gt;, announced for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PS4. But sadly, the first two entries in the trilogy will be based on the &lt;em&gt;Sigma &lt;/em&gt;re-releases that originally came out on PS3 and PS Vita, not their definitive versions (&lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden Black&lt;/em&gt; for the original Xbox and &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden II&lt;/em&gt; for the Xbox 360) because the team says their source code went missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzeilD"&gt;Citing a recent &lt;em&gt;Famitsu &lt;/em&gt;interview (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/koei-tecmo-couldnt-salvage-the-data-for-ninja-gaiden-bl-1846550279"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), a staffer from developer Team Ninja told the publication that “there are only fragments of the data that remain. We couldn’t salvage them.” So, it’s not that the company prefers the &lt;em&gt;Sigma&lt;/em&gt; remakes over the beloved original titles: this was Team Ninja’s only option, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ninja Gaiden Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TLOd7H--AMbIRgxvT-UZmMkH8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397952/8bc003df_2fc2_4cd1_8f1f_ffa84b3c7573.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Another screengrab from Ninja Gaiden Black running on Xbox One X, showcasing the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1138830407539994625" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;original design of the Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; as an easter egg.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIEtRW"&gt;“I am aware there are pros and cons,” says Team Ninja brand manager Fumihiko Yasuda, referring to the &lt;em&gt;Sigma &lt;/em&gt;remakes. “For me personally, &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden II&lt;/em&gt; was my debut, and so I have a deep feeling for it,” Yasuda said in &lt;em&gt;Famitsu&lt;/em&gt;. The pros he’s speaking of are the graphical and performance enhancements and extra content. The cons are more plentiful, like how many people felt &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sigma &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sigma II &lt;/em&gt;were made easier than the 2004, 2005, and 2008 copies of those games, and that some of the level design, game items, story beats, and enemies were changed. The interview doesn’t address whether the data for the original 2004 version of &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; still exists, or if &lt;em&gt;Sigma&lt;/em&gt; is really the only complete copy of the game in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDlJtb"&gt;I’m still looking forward to playing all of these games again, possibly on my Nintendo Switch, but this is yet another example of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516254/video-game-history-foundation-secret-of-monkey-island-code"&gt;why preservation in gaming is so important&lt;/a&gt;. These aren’t even particularly old titles, with the original &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; releasing on the Xbox just 17 years ago. But, regardless of age, gaming’s rich history is better off remembered by having those games around rather than wishing they still existed. Well, time to go clutch my copy of &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden Black&lt;/em&gt; and never let go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rec Room rides uptick in users during the pandemic to become a VR unicorn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/48Pex6eiBkn5c-VplRJwiCrt2C0=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027021/RecRoom_Fantasy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rec Room&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GoWiY2"&gt;Gaming platform &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; is now a unicorn, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/23/social-gaming-platform-rec-room-raises-100m-at-1-25b-valuation/"&gt;valued at $1.25 billion&lt;/a&gt; during a recent funding round of $100 million. It appears to be one of the first, if not the first, virtual reality-focused startup to achieve unicorn status, a notable feat since Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5547456/facebook-buying-oculus-for-2-billion"&gt;landmark acquisition of Oculus VR for $2.4 billion in 2014&lt;/a&gt; helped established the modern VR business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUyftN"&gt;Founded in 2016, &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; is a free app that lets players build custom virtual spaces and games that can be played across various platforms. The Seattle-based company launched on Steam as a VR-focused platform, and in 2018, expanded to non-VR platforms. It’s now available on Xbox, PlayStation, iOS, and PC. CEO Nick Fajt said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that VR usage on the platform climbed over the holiday season due in part to &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/zuckerberg-quest-2-mainstream-vr-headset-facebook-q4-2020-earnings/"&gt;sales of the Oculus Quest 2 headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4e2oaC"&gt;In 2020, &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; saw a 566 percent increase in revenue — most of that comes from in-game purchases — and it now has more than 15 million lifetime users. Fajt says the company now has 1 million monthly active VR users, a number that tripled during the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-gaming-platform-rec-room-valued-at-1-25-billion-in-fundraising-round-11616544000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUtbqm"&gt;The platform’s primary users are teenagers between ages 13 and 16, Fajt said, so &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; benefited from students being online longer during the coronavirus lockdowns of 2020. But it was also growing in popularity before people were confined to their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HaYGnF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People need a space like this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ik60i3"&gt;“The pandemic accelerated trends we’d been seeing for several years,” Fajt said. “A lot of people are looking for a digital third place that’s distinct from home and school or work where they can meet up with friends, hang out, explore, and be creative. I think that’s been true whether teenagers were going to school physically or on Zoom. People need a space like this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDTf6T"&gt;He added that while it’s possible the platform may see a decrease in users once teenagers can gather in person, he sees &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; as more than just a replacement for real-life socializing. “It’s helping a lot of people maintain connections with friends that are hundreds or thousands of miles away,” Fajt said. “These are friends separated by physical distance not just social distance. So if &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; has become part of your routine, I suspect it will stay that way even beyond the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTySJt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt; is preparing for an IPO in the coming years. In the meantime, other gaming platforms are continuing to grow thanks to a boost from pandemic audiences. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, an online gaming platform for slightly younger users than &lt;em&gt;Rec Room’&lt;/em&gt;s, also has seen a sharp uptick in use during the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-shares-jump-in-public-markets-debut-11615402033?mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; went public&lt;/a&gt; via direct listing earlier this month and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that it has 31.1 million daily users, who spent an average of 2.6 hours daily on the platform in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CfrPz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last summer that over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite"&gt;half of US kids and teenagers&lt;/a&gt; under the age of 16 play the game. During the pandemic there has been much &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/health/covid-kids-tech-use.html"&gt;hand-wringing about kids’ increased screentime&lt;/a&gt;, but games like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;provide socialization, just not the in-person kind we may be used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LjDk5A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A fifth of Facebook’s workforce is working on VR and AR devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUff5b"&gt;Before the pandemic, some of the appetite to develop new AR and VR hardware had started to wane — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540786/sony-playstation-jim-ryan-psvr-headset-timeline-ps5"&gt;Sony PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan suggested&lt;/a&gt; in October that an update to Sony’s PlayStation VR headset was still a few years away. (Sony has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;teased more details about its next iteration of PlayStation VR&lt;/a&gt; with a formal product announcement, followed by images of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;new controllers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Goct4A"&gt;But other companies have for years been ramping up their efforts in AR and VR hardware. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier this month that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326875/facebook-reality-labs-ar-vr-headcount-report"&gt;Facebook has some 10,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; — roughly a fifth of its workforce — focused on new devices in both fields, and the company has already shown off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;prototypes of experimental research products&lt;/a&gt; and plans to release a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;pair of Ray-Ban-branded smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; later this year. Apple has long been rumored to be working on AR and VR hardware, too, and recent reports suggest the iPhone maker will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272555/apple-dan-riccio-ar-vr-development"&gt;debut a VR device sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdSoCW"&gt;“The market has shown an increased appetite for gaming companies,” Fajt said. “I think that will only grow as more data becomes available about the strength and durability of these businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s new touchscreen drive selector doesn’t violate the rules, NHTSA says </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1hU_SxBx2DW-VobuerJjerUcPg=/0x0:1201x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026837/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QAJj5x"&gt;Tesla’s decision to remove the gear-selector stalk from the steering wheel and automate shifting between park, reverse, neutral, and drive (PRND) does not violate any federal motor vehicle rules, a spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Agency told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY2QHX"&gt;The gear selection via touchscreen is a backup while Tesla still works to fully automate the process. A video of the new touchscreen interface that will be available in refreshed versions of Tesla’s Model S and X surfaced earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348668/tesla-prnd-drive-mode-park-neutral-model-s-x-refresh"&gt;causing a bit of a stir&lt;/a&gt; over the safety of using a touchscreen to control such basic, safety-critical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BW5sbu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A properly configured transmission shift control operated by means of a touch screen interface would not violate federal motor vehicle safety standards”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9WFvvW"&gt;But NHTSA says that Tesla isn’t violating any safety standards with its unorthodox approach to PRND, and it’s not aware of any problems “at this time.” The spokesperson said in an email (emphasis ours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="26G0eG"&gt;NHTSA is aware of the touch screen shift control Tesla developed for its Model S and other vehicles. A properly configured transmission shift control operated by means of a touch screen interface would not violate federal motor vehicle safety standards. Also, Tesla has certified compliance with all applicable safety standards. &lt;strong&gt;At this time, there are no known compliance concerns related to the shift control configuration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G6u13I"&gt;The operative phrase is “at this time” because the refreshed versions of the S and X are only just now reaching customers. If problems do arise, NHTSA says it stands ready to act and urges Tesla owners to report any safety concerns to the agency at their website or by calling the vehicle safety hotline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1Fcig"&gt;By law, all vehicles sold in the US must be self-certified by the manufacturer as meeting all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). That certification is in the form of a label on the door jamb of each vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEhW28"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;NHTSA is already investigating&lt;/a&gt; over two dozen crashes involving Tesla vehicles. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338427/tesla-autopilot-crash-michigan-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;NHTSA said it was sending its special crash investigation team&lt;/a&gt; to probe two crashes in Michigan, including a crash involving a Tesla suspected of being in Autopilot mode when it smashed into a parked state police patrol car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfLAIg"&gt;Tesla also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262072/tesla-display-failure-flash-mcu-recall-model-s-x-nhtsa"&gt;agreed to recall&lt;/a&gt; more than 134,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs that will eventually suffer from faulty displays after pressure from NHTSA.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG Mobile has been downloaded more than 1 billion times</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vHsdeepKc79no8Fy5aVfvYqVXKE=/720x0:1920x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026735/pc_kv3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fiNSVa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUGB Mobile &lt;/em&gt;has passed yet another milestone with 1 billion total downloads worldwide, Tencent announced. Although that number excludes Mainland China, it still marks a significant presence for the already huge game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrWWwF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUGB Mobile&lt;/em&gt; has long been considered one of the most popular games on the planet, following its 2018 release. In 2019, it passed the marker for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660985/pubg-mobile-monthly-revenue-players-highest-grossing-mobile-game"&gt;highest-grossing&lt;/a&gt; mobile game. Along with the news, Tencent also announced a partnership with &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;. Players will be able to take part in an in-game event to go along with the upcoming movie, which includes a game mode and themed content. Tencent is also making classic map Karakin open to mobile players on April 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KSMaJ"&gt;The developer continues to support the mobile game with updates including maps and more. Earlier this year, Tencent announced a new mobile entry in the series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22297267/pubg-new-state-battle-royale-game-android-ios-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; That game is expected to launch on Android and iOS later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Competitively priced Motorola G100 and G50 offer 90Hz screens and 5,000mAh batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ex2R7u7FDA_J2DB2Uju9aKZ4B0Y=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026703/both.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.7-inch Motorola G100 (left) and the 6.5-inch G50 offer big batteries and 5G connectivity.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oiVLTU"&gt;Motorola &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fblog%2Fhello-moto-g100&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350611%2Fmotorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has unveiled the G100 and G50&lt;/a&gt;, two midrange phones headed first for European and Latin American markets. Both offer displays with fast 90Hz refresh rates for smooth scrolling and animations, 5G connectivity, and they embrace Motorola’s ethos of “more battery, more better” with huge 5,000mAh cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMcr76"&gt;The higher-end G100 is poised to compete with the likes of the Google Pixel 4A 5G with a Snapdragon 870 5G processor, 8GB of RAM, and a dual wide / ultrawide selfie camera for €499.99 (~$587). The G50, on the other hand, looks like a respectable, budget-friendlier device — its faster refresh rate, 6.5-inch screen is still a bit rare at its €229.99 (~$269) price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NlJWI5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10412513"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDG5VZ"&gt;The Motorola G100 offers a large 6.7-inch 1080p LCD. Its 8GB of RAM is accompanied by 128GB of storage, which is expandable thanks to a MicroSD card slot. Support for sub-6GHz 5G frequencies is included, as is Wi-Fi 6. The G100 features a main 64-megapixel camera (lacking optical stabilization, sadly) complemented by a 16-megapixel ultrawide that doubles as a macro camera, complete with a built-in ring flash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVGckN"&gt;Two selfie cameras are offered — an approach Google took with the Pixel 3 and subsequently abandoned — with a 16-megapixel wide and 8-megapixel ultrawide. Up to 6K / 30p video recording is possible with the main rear camera, and the rear ultrawide can capture 4K / 30p clips — something found on many flagships but isn’t too common in this upper midrange class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hNRPCM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10412520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClDon0"&gt;The Motorola G50 uses a slightly smaller (but still, you know, large) 6.5-inch 720p screen. It includes a slower Snapdragon 480 chipset with 4GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of storage (thankfully, there’s a microSD slot here, too). The rear triple-camera array is mostly just a 48-megapixel standard wide camera; the accompanying 5-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth sensor don’t offer a whole lot of practical use. If none of that sounds too compelling, consider that the European pricing equates to well under $300. If the device were to make it to the US, it would be well-equipped to compete at that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFkxlJ"&gt;There’s no confirmation just now if and when these phones will be sold in the US, but we’ll be keeping an eye out for them. In the meantime, the G100 goes on sale in European and Latin American markets today, while the G50 will arrive in “selected European markets” in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qmpa6"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey is just trolling Congress with Twitter polls now</title>

      &lt;img alt="House Committees Confront Tech CEOs Over Online Spread Of False Info" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I9duW3xFZTHlUvD1i08VkfmM7ls=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026692/1231928203.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbNExA"&gt;Congressional “Big Tech” hearings often follow a three-step formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2b0Hs"&gt;Step one: lawmakers demand that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai answer questions simply with “yes” or “no.” (Sample: “Is YouTube’s recommendation algorithm designed to encourage users to stay on the site?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGO2SD"&gt;Step two: the aforementioned CEOs inevitably say something else, either to inject some legitimate nuance or to dodge obvious, unflattering answers with vague platitudes. (Sundar Pichai’s response to the above question: “Content responsibility is our number one goal.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9dVD6"&gt;Step three: lawmakers point out that they’re avoiding the question and mock them. (Sample, from Rep. Billy Long of Missouri: “I’m going to ask you a yes-or-no question. Do you know the difference between these two words: ‘yes’ and ‘no?’”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI6oTf"&gt;Later today, my colleague Makena Kelly will publish a breakdown of “Disinformation Nation,” &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting"&gt;a marathon House of Representatives hearing&lt;/a&gt; about social media, extremism, and misinformation. But to massively oversimplify, just imagine several hours of that three-step process — and that Jack Dorsey is clearly, obviously sick of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3MZGol"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;jack pulling out phone to probably check notifications after done speaking: &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvafY0Dpwz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kvafY0Dpwz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1375157286591590400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9N2rPu"&gt;While Pichai and Zuckerberg have mostly stuck to answering questions, Dorsey has started openly tweeting through the hearing — favoriting other people’s commentary, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375159131548512257"&gt;sending passive-aggressive quote tweets&lt;/a&gt; wishing the questions were better, and trolling Congress with a Twitter poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WxYqDQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ORSKuj"&gt;Jack Dorsey, for what it’s worth, answered “yes” to Long’s question. And on Twitter, “yes” is winning by a margin of 65.5 percent to 34.5 percent — but depending on how much longer this hearing lasts, there’s plenty of time for that to change.&lt;/p&gt;
