    <title>Google search panels launch to counter vaccine misinformation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1iJAwm"&gt;Google is launching new vaccine information panels in its search results to counter misinformation and educate people about what’s available in their location, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/accurate-timely-information-covid-19-vaccines/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The panels are rolling out starting in the United Kingdom, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/02/pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-wins-licence-for-use-in-the-uk"&gt;is approved&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/coventry-woman-90-first-patient-to-receive-covid-vaccine-in-nhs-campaign"&gt;is being administered&lt;/a&gt;, and will be introduced in more countries as local health authorities begin authorizing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCcju9"&gt;The panels include information on each individual vaccine, and aim to address vaccine misinformation, and give guidance about how, when, and where people can receive the shots. Google has used similar information panels to share information &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/21/21189051/google-coronavirus-website-launches-covid19-trump-enhanced-search-results"&gt;about COVID-19 generally&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225828/google-showing-covid-19-testing-centers-search-results"&gt;locations of testing centers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vZ-etZIft1tCHxdkHwA6oiEImw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159531/ezgif_4_aa8213208664.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information panels will provide information about approved vaccines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ix05wW"&gt;In addition to search results, Google says it is sharing similar vaccine information via its COVID-19 panels on YouTube. These were first launched in March to share information about the pandemic, and Google says they’ve been viewed over 400 billion times since. Google has also been cracking down on anti-vax content on YouTube, and announced in October that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515796/youtube-covid-vaccine-misniformation-policy"&gt;remove videos containing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It now says it’s removed over 700,000 videos “related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXu8c2"&gt;Finally, Google has announced it’s providing more funds to help health authorities and the media provide useful information about vaccines and debunk misinformation. The company is providing an additional $15 million in ad grants to the World Health Organization to help it promote health initiatives, and it’s spending $1.5 million to support fact-checking research and fund a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub, which is intended to be a resource for journalists to help give them access to scientific expertise and research updates. It’s also funding research into how to counteract vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SSURA"&gt;In total, Google says it has launched over 200 products, features, and initiatives in response to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0IvF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VABMHF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former employees say Apple stood by while suppliers violated Chinese labor laws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Factory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZCyaMV3D9dfqcO6GRC5a2fbvMI=/18x0:693x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488393/apple-factory.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Factory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YdEiwP"&gt;Apple has been complicit in its suppliers’ violations of Chinese labor laws, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-turned-blind-eye-to-supplier-breaches-of-chinese-labor-laws?utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;amp;utm_content=1002702&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=cio&amp;amp;utm_term=1000266"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Suppliers have periodically filled their factories with temporary workers or “dispatch labor,” violating a Chinese labor law requiring no more than 10 percent of a factory’s workers be temporary employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rILLI"&gt;Much like in the US, temporary employees in China receive lower pay and fewer benefits, and they’ve become increasingly common as interest in factory jobs has shrunk according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. The law limiting the use of dispatch labor came into effect in 2014, and that year Apple conducted a survey of its suppliers in China to determine how many already complied. The company found that among 362 factories, “nearly half were over the quota for temporary workers,” according to a presentation &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e75UuW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple took no major action against its suppliers for violating temp-worker labor laws&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lihBd2"&gt;Despite that figure, not much had changed by 2016 and the end of a grace period for complying. Three former members of Apple’s “supplier responsibility team” said that the company “took no major action against its suppliers for violating the temp-worker labor law out of concerns it would create costs, drain resources and delay product launches.” If the claims are true, it’s notable because Apple says it applies its supplier code of conduct policies equally across its supply chain, which should prevent these kinds of violations from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lAzcM"&gt;New data Apple collected in 2018 shows the problem continued. &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;says that a Quanta factory manufacturing Apple Watches hired 5,000 temporary workers to bring its workforce to 18,000. That’s around 27 percent temporary workers, above the 10 percent limit set by the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odzpaM"&gt;This isn’t the first time labor laws have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2012/2/8/2785448/foxconn-factory-working-conditions-company-responses"&gt;violated on Apple’s watch&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Apple actually admitted to at least a portion of this dispatch labor problem in its &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-foxconn-temporary-workers-china.html"&gt;dealings with Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. Foxconn had exceeded the 10 percent limit, despite previously agreeing multiple times to stop. And just last month another supplier, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556154/apple-supplier-pegatron-student-labor-violation"&gt;Pegatron, violated student labor laws&lt;/a&gt; and falsified its records to cover it up. Apple’s reported response was to put the company on “probation,” preventing it from conducting any new business with Apple until the problem was resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcEzRK"&gt;Despite the Pegatron example, punishments have still not been broadly applied.  Limits on temporary labor are an issue that all large tech companies manufacturing in China have likely been dealing with, but it’s Apple’s desire to “surprise and delight,” along with maintaining aggressive production quotas, that have potentially worsened the problem. In a quote from the report, an unnamed Apple executive admits as much: “We are making it difficult for our suppliers to comply with this law as 10% dispatch is simply not enough to cope with the spikes in labor demand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK8zhr"&gt;Apple is aware this is an issue, but until it’s willing to step in and take bolder action, suppliers will take shortcuts to keep Apple’s business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces massive 110-inch 4K TV with next-gen MicroLED picture quality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eng9ersKU7LfcTruv9O_VcZlzIA=/0x11:2296x1542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488273/Screen_Shot_2020_12_09_at_8.06.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocbCn9"&gt;Over the last couple years, Samsung has showed off (and sold to a very rich few) its &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/products/displays/direct-view-led/the-wall/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;futuristic, modular TV dubbed The Wall&lt;/a&gt; that uses MicroLED technology. MicroLED shares many of OLED’s best traits — without most of the associated drawbacks — and is widely viewed as the next big upgrade leap for the displays in our lives. Now, Samsung is taking MicroLED and putting it into a more traditional TV form factor. Today the company announced the 110-inch MicroLED TV, which goes up for presale today in Korea and will launch globally in the first quarter of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COmqhL"&gt;As for the first question that probably comes to mind, no, Samsung isn't yet revealing a price for this enormous TV using the latest picture technology. But you can expect it’ll cost far more than any of the company’s other 4K (or even 8K) sets on account of the self-emitting MicroLED magic. You won’t really notice any bezels or borders in these images; this TV has a 99.99 percent screen-to-body ratio, but Samsung still managed to build in “an embedded Majestic Sound System” that it claims “delivers breathtaking 5.1 channel sound with no external speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfYmIA-hUErdic24l8PLKMDtCF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158887/MicroLED.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jo0lei"&gt;Here’s what Samsung says about picture quality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Fg5d5E"&gt;The 110-inch MicroLED uses micrometer-sized LED lights to eliminate the backlight and color filters utilized in conventional displays. Instead, it is self-illuminating — producing light and color from its own pixel structures. It expresses 100 percent of the DCI and Adobe RGB color gamut, and accurately delivers wide color gamut images taken with high-end DSLR cameras. This results in stunning, lifelike colors, and accurate brightness from the display’s 4K resolution and 8 million pixels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="w0wVbA"&gt;Since all those LEDs are self-illuminating, you get the perfect blacks and fantastic contrast that have come to define OLED. But crucially, MicroLED is inorganic and thus should have better long-term durability. There shouldn’t be any threat of burn in, which is already getting rarer on modern OLED TVs. Samsung estimates a lifespan of around 100,000 hours — or “up to a decade.” In the case of The Wall, those MicroLEDs are put into modular panels that can be combined to create a TV of pretty much any size — if you’ve got the scratch to pay for it. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcasjyW_OYE"&gt;Here’s one example of The Wall&lt;/a&gt; that was installed in a luxury London home. But the 110-inch TV is a more traditional form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e56H1M"&gt;As for whether the 110-inch MicroLED includes HDMI 2.1 and supports all the things that it makes possible (like 120Hz 4K gaming), I’ve asked Samsung. but an answer wasn't available at press time. One neat software trick is the ability to simultaneously watch up to four sources of content (even from different HDMI inputs) with the TV’s Multi View feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htMK0A"&gt;Samsung says that manufacturing a 110-inch MicroLED TV wasn't possible until recent innovations, and the company credits “a new production process derived from its semiconductor business” as helping to make it possible. Smaller MicroLED TVs are already on the roadmap, so while this thing is sure to have a price that’s out of reach for many people, someday there will be models that won’t be as cost-prohibitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIGdQe"&gt;That’s still a ways out, though, and Samsung is expected to have a fresh lineup of more mainstream (and still great looking) consumer QLED 4K and 8K TVs next month during a virtual CES 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T for $1.175 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF4efHRCnG5wPHovm_wc_gwL3xs=/22x0:933x607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488042/crunchyroll_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4Peux"&gt;Sony will be buying anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;amp;T for $1.175 billion, Sony and AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2020/1209/atttosellcrunchyrolltosonysfunimationglobalgroup"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Crunchyroll will become part of Sony’s Funimation, which already licenses many popular shows such as &lt;em&gt;Attack on Titan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;One Piece.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vHXOS"&gt;Now that Sony owns both Crunchyroll and Funimation, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/21547657/sonys-funimation-acquires-crunchyroll-deal-price-watching-anime"&gt;tremendous power over&lt;/a&gt; anime in the US at a time when many other media companies are trying to figure out their anime content. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-something-super-weird-about-netflix-anime/"&gt;also invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in both licensing and producing its own anime content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvR6Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are excited to embark on this new journey”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cwJtag"&gt;“We are excited to embark on this new journey,” said Joanne Waage, general manager of Crunchyroll, in a statement. “Crunchyroll has built a world-class brand with a passionate fan-base of over 3 million subscribers, 50 million social followers and 90 million registered users. These amazing fans have helped to propel anime into a global phenomenon. Combining the strength of the Crunchyroll brand and the expertise of our global team with Funimation is an exciting prospect and a win for the incredible art form of anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfZYHc"&gt;“The union of Funimation and Crunchyroll is a win for anime fans around the world that will elevate the art and culture of this medium for decades to come,” Colin Decker, CEO of Funimation Global Group, said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.funimation.com%2Fblog%2F2020%2F12%2F09%2Ffunimation-to-acquire-crunchyroll-fans-win%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dorg-social%26utm_campaign%3Drelease%26utm_content%3Dcr-fun%26sf134076722%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22166585%2Fsony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Combining these two great companies will be a win for fans, and enable us to compete at a truly global scale. I am honored to welcome the wonderful Crunchyroll team to a shared mission—to help everyone belong to the extraordinary world of anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKIce3"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has been shopping around Crunchyroll for some time, and AT&amp;amp;T and Sony have apparently been in talks for months about the deal. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-t-wants-1-5-billion-in-crunchyroll-sale-to-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T wanted Sony to pay $1.5 billion for Crunchyroll, and the two sides were reportedly close to a nearly $1 billion deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541734/crunchyroll-sony-acquisition-talks-near-end-1-billion-nikkei"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpgNdp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T purchased Crunchyroll as part of Otter Media in 2018 from the Chernin Group for a reported sum of more than $1 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/business/media/otter-media-chernin-group-att.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The sale gave AT&amp;amp;T ownership over a number of digital properties. John Stankey, current CEO of AT&amp;amp;T but then head of WarnerMedia, said the company would use the Otter Media acquisition to “harness Otter’s expertise” while strengthening its own digital assets. Under Stankey’s leadership, AT&amp;amp;T and WarnerMedia are now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;focused on building up HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, the crown jewel of the company’s streaming offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L3dWB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida’s justification for raiding COVID data whistleblower Rebekah Jones is looking a little shaky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FE2cK9HKOihMIRe4DBVD7FdN8ak=/31x0:369x225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487687/emfGgCL9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Io8uS"&gt;On Tuesday, Florida state police entered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;the home of Rebekah Jones with guns drawn&lt;/a&gt;, seizing her computer and phone, in an attempt to prove that she’d sent an unauthorized “group text” through “a Department of Health messaging system” that is “to be used for emergencies only,” according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56danA"&gt;There are now two reasons why that’s significant. First, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;as we reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Jones isn’t just any former Florida Department of Health employee: she’s the whistleblower who built Florida’s once-celebrated COVID-19 tracking dashboard, then accused her bosses &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;of ordering her to manipulate Florida’s data&lt;/a&gt; to justify reopening the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sKQUA"&gt;Second, it’s now come to our attention that the supposedly private messaging system that Jones might have accessed might have effectively just been an email address — an email address that the Florida Department of Health may have inadvertently published &lt;em&gt;for anyone to see&lt;/em&gt; on the open web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDfZdG"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/florida-posted-the-password-to-a-key-disaster-system-on-its-website/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, Redditors discovered that not only does the Florida Department of Health have a &lt;em&gt;single &lt;/em&gt;shared username and password, but that username and password is also freely accessible on the web. Here’s a redacted screenshot that Ars captured of &lt;em&gt;just one&lt;/em&gt; of at least seven PDFs that contain the information, PDFs that I also easily found with a Google search. All of them are still online at the time I type these words:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qq8AHB"&gt;But it’s not just the username and password that are listed: these pages also have the email address of the exact group Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) claimed was hacked: “StateESF8.Planning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7b0yS"&gt;In the FDLE’s affidavit — which is how it got a search warrant for Jones’ home — the department characterizes StateESF8.Planning as a “multi-user account group” and talks about how Florida uses it to “coordinate the state’s health and medical resources, capabilities, and capacities.” That all sounds very official and important:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9sdmvWdxaQlhUGiIgheUjIj36k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158531/Clipboard01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small portion of the affadavit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0CuEXd"&gt;However, the publicly available usernames, passwords, and email addresses suggest it might have just been a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bog-standard mailing list with an awful lot of users, not something particularly private or secure. The email address still appears to be valid, though the Florida webmail application no longer seems to be online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrJ6s"&gt;None of this necessarily means that Jones didn’t send the message (though she &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/07/us/florida-search-warrant-raid-rebekah-jones-invs/index.html"&gt;vehemently denies she did&lt;/a&gt;). An FDLE agent under oath says the “group text” was specifically sent from a Comcast ID associated with her home address, and that’s why her home was raided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqY9v6"&gt;But if Jones did happen to send an email to a giant mailing list she used to be part of, one listed on the open web, would that be much of a crime? (I am not a lawyer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPbWgi"&gt;I asked the FDLE to explain how it could have been accessed illegally — if the email address might have required someone to use private credentials somehow — but it declined, citing the active investigation. A spokesperson simply stated that my suggestions were “not accurate,” and that “this was not simply an email.” The Florida Department of Health didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhibof"&gt;On Wednesday, a Republican attorney appointed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis to nominate judges &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonGOPVet4Biden/status/1336339189374152704"&gt;resigned in protest&lt;/a&gt; over the raid on Jones’ house, calling it “unconscionable.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook calls antitrust lawsuits ‘revisionist history’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLMvzV5m91Jp6dMakv-4w_xbZfo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487638/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bjt85p"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of 48 state attorneys general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed broad antitrust charges against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a reversal of its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. Now, Facebook has responded to those charges in an extensive post titled &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/lawsuits-filed-by-the-ftc-and-state-attorneys-general-are-revisionist-history/"&gt;“Lawsuits Filed by the FTC and the State Attorneys General Are Revisionist History,”&lt;/a&gt; written by general counsel Jennifer Newstead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxvNUX"&gt;Newstead’s primary defense is that both acquisitions resulted in better products for consumers — an implicit reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21524886/google-market-power-justice-department-antitrust-lawsuit-consumer-harm"&gt;the “consumer harm” standard&lt;/a&gt; that has also been central to the Department of Justice’s case against Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fCzTtt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCDTzT"&gt;“These transactions were intended to provide better products for the people who use them, and they unquestionably did,” Facebook argues. “The FTC and states stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCHvmU"&gt;Facebook also takes issue with the retroactive nature of the breakup. Both acquisitions are more than five years old, and were approved by regulatory agencies at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wlnq8U"&gt;“Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward because they did not threaten competition,” the post reads, detailing the FTC and European Commission reviews of the deals. “This lawsuit risks sowing doubt and uncertainty about the US government’s own merger review process and whether acquiring businesses can actually rely on the outcomes of the legal process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0TF6o"&gt;The question of retroactive review is an open topic in legal circles, but &lt;a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Menesh%20Patel.pdf"&gt;some scholars&lt;/a&gt; have argued it is beneficial for regulators to revisit previously cleared transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mynQrw"&gt;The post also directly addresses one if the central allegations of both lawsuits — that Facebook locks out potentially competitive products from its platform, starving competitors of a much-needed user base. This behavior was particularly stark in the case of Vine, which was locked out of Facebook’s social API functions as soon as it was acquired by Twitter, reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents"&gt;at the direction of Mark Zuckerberg himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF4RDA"&gt;In the post, Newstead claims this kind of API restriction is standard practice for platforms. “Where platforms give access to other developers — and many do not provide access at all — they usually prohibit duplication of core functions,” the post reads. “LinkedIn, The New York Times, Pinterest and Uber, to name a few, all have similar policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDJU1B"&gt;“Overall, we disagree with the government’s allegations and we plan to fight this in court,” Zuckerberg said in a post to employees shared by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; tech reporter Mike Isaac &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1336825630034337792"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “The reality is that we compete with many other services in everything we do, and we compete fairly.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX flies Starship prototype rocket to highest altitude yet — but doesn’t stick the landing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-vtNxB2PzPrRUaWSt4PVtIlYmY=/0x21:1716x1165/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487628/starship.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecJeDn"&gt;During a test flight on Wednesday, SpaceX flew a prototype of its next generation Starship rocket to its highest height yet in the skies above Texas — but failed to stick the landing, with the vehicle exploding when it hit the ground. Propelled by three main engines, the vehicle launched to an altitude of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, before crash landing into the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Ef04"&gt;The nearly seven-minute test flight took off at around 5:45PM ET from SpaceX’s facility at Boca Chica, Texas. The prototype climbed to its target altitude, but during the flight, two of its three main engines seemingly shut down while it ascended. Eventually all three engines cut off, and SpaceX attempted to perform a “bell flop” maneuver, with the vehicle falling horizontally on the way down to Earth. Just before reaching the ground, the prototype reignited its engines — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336809767574982658?s=20"&gt;but the vehicle came in way too fast&lt;/a&gt; and blew apart when it hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P6UDVz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The flight was the most ambitious test yet of SpaceX’s Starship&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5zxMK"&gt;The flight was the most ambitious test yet of SpaceX’s Starship, meant to test out the launch and landing capabilities of the future rocket. Made out of a steel alloy, the silo-shaped rocket is supposed to act as a spaceship, a rocket, and a lander all in one, carrying people and cargo to deep-space destinations. SpaceX plans to launch the vehicle to orbit on another massive rocket called the Super Heavy. Once in space, Starship is supposed to use its main engines to land upright on other worlds — such as the Moon or Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu3jD5"&gt;Despite the explosive landing, SpaceX still considered the test a win. On its livestream of the event, the company included a banner that read: “Awesome test. Congrats Starship team!” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also expressed enthusiasm for the flight on Twitter, noting that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336808486022258688?s=20"&gt;the test succeeded in a number of its objectives&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier, Musk only gave the flight a one-third chance of success, noting that a “lot of things need to go right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MDuwR"&gt;Even before the flight occurred, SpaceX had noted on its website that completing a perfect flight wasn’t the marker for success. “With a test such as this, success is not measured by completion of specific objectives but rather how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship,” &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/index.html"&gt;the company wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk-RFQJKPR5MgSdcUZJ150aT8RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158572/starship_10.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StPAs4"&gt;SpaceX has been cranking out Starship prototypes over the last few years at the company’s test facility in Boca Chica, performing incremental tests and flights on the vehicles in preparation for sending one to orbit. The one that flew today is the eighth major prototype the company has crafted. SpaceX has flown a few Starship prototypes before, but only to just under 500 feet, or 150 meters, in the air. Those prototypes were also smaller in size than the final Starship design, and didn’t sport the nosecone at the top of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zsl7D4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1331388984023461888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 25, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kPuDy6"&gt;The prototype that flew today bore a much stronger resemblance to the finalized Starship, including the nosecone, as well as flaps on the side of the vehicle meant to help with steering during landing. The vehicle was also equipped with three Raptors, giant engines that SpaceX has developed just for Starship. The final Starship will supposedly be equipped with six main Raptor engines — three optimized to be used at sea level and three optimized for use in the vacuum of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m6XTVNRip7mTj-5gPDCUrk9XCiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158548/starship2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TRVzCv"&gt;SpaceX already has two other prototypes built, similar in size and shape to today’s prototype — dubbed SN9 and SN10. It’s possible those vehicles will see some upcoming flights, as well, especially now that the eighth prototype is no longer in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLUfCd"&gt;SpaceX has a lot riding on these tests, as the company hopes to use Starship to fulfill Musk’s ambitions of starting a settlement on Mars. NASA is also considering using Starship as a lunar lander for its Artemis program. It’s possible NASA astronauts could take SpaceX’s Starship down to the surface of the Moon as a part of the agency’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BaY05x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ap-BkkrRg-o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVNeIc"&gt;Meanwhile, SpaceX has started construction on another important piece of the Starship system: the Super Heavy booster that will loft Starship into orbit. It’s unclear when the vehicle will take its first flight. In September of 2019, Musk predicted that SpaceX would send a Starship into orbit within six months. More than a year later, the timeline for the first orbital flight is murky — but today’s flight puts SpaceX closer to that important launch&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A secretive treasure hunter is unmasked by a court case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7m_a5O9X__j1LeYkxOF1Gg5VbLY=/0x63:479x382/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487620/fenn002_enl_2fbdab7583766a0b345136cc8b5528ba8302dd79_s1400.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of the chest hidden by Forrest Fenn. | Photo: Forrest Fenn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0i0YTO"&gt;Finding a long-hidden treasure in the woods of Wyoming seems like a tall tale that would be told around a campfire, but it happens to be reality for Jack Stuef. As with many treasure hunting stories, though, the intrigue isn’t over just because the prize has been found. Stuef had been trying to stay anonymous and had done so until this week, but now he says he’s been forced to reveal his identity &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-treasure-chest-rocky-mountains-forrest-fenn-20200608-xltbeao5zvbkjiby732x73fhxe-story.html"&gt;after a lawsuit was filed&lt;/a&gt; alleging that he obtained the treasure through hacking and stalking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfKhyu"&gt;The chest in question, &lt;a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/forrest-fenn-confirms-his-treasure-has-been-found/article_37006cfe-a8d7-11ea-8653-873ca96e31ef.html"&gt;filled with 22 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of treasure-y things like gold coins and jewelry, was hidden by Forrest Fenn, a Santa Fe art dealer, and has been the object of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/forrest-fenn-treasure-chest-pictures-trnd/index.html"&gt;widely publicized hunt&lt;/a&gt; that’s been going on since 2010. Stuef’s desire for his identity to remain hidden is understandable, as some treasure hunters have gone as far as to &lt;a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1233629/pennsylvania-man-arrested-at-forrest-fenns-house.html"&gt;break into Fenn’s house&lt;/a&gt; and file lawsuits against him after he announced the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUziT3"&gt;Stuef now has to deal with a lawsuit of his own, which was filed against him (as “Unknown Defendant”) and Fenn by Barbara Anderson, another treasure hunter who says she’s spent a considerable amount of time and money on the search. She filed it in an attempt to find the identity of the finder and alleges that the treasure’s finder followed her and hacked into her computer and email to steal the information and clues she had gathered. Anderson had been searching in and around Santa Fe, though the treasure ended up &lt;a href="https://dalneitzel.com/2020/08/27/18/"&gt;being found in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;. She claims that she had found the final clue that led to the treasure’s actual location but that Stuef followed her to it and was able to beat her to the treasure’s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIvSeI"&gt;Stuef denies that any of this happened, but he says developments in the case will soon lead to his identity becoming a matter of public record, so he wanted to beat it to the punch and reveal himself on his own terms. “The U.S. District Court for New Mexico has ruled that Forrest’s estate must provide some of my personal information to a woman I do not know and with whom I have never communicated,” he says &lt;a href="https://thefinder.medium.com/a-statement-on-the-disclosure-of-my-identity-602d95f04b9f"&gt;in his Medium post revealing his identity&lt;/a&gt;, before calling the lawsuit “meritless.” He says that he “found the treasure as [Fenn] designed it to be found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1tiAr"&gt;Alongside the Medium post, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2419429/forrest-fenn-treasure-jack-stuef"&gt;a story in &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that has more details about Stuef’s two-year search — except for the one many treasure hunters were hoping to learn: where he found it. Stuef says that he’s keeping that secret to honor what he believes would’ve been Fenn’s wishes. (Fenn &lt;a href="https://thefinder.medium.com/a-remembrance-of-forrest-fenn-1be2a8646ff2"&gt;died in September&lt;/a&gt;.) He doesn’t want the location to “become a tourist attraction” for treasure hunters. For now, he still has the treasure chest hidden away in a vault somewhere (as all treasures should be), but he hopes to sell it to someone who will let other treasure hunters see it (though exactly where that is, he’s keeping a secret for now). &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="d3pgHB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/ratatouille-musical-tiktok.html"&gt;TikTok’s fan-made crowdsourced &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; is making the jump from social media to the stage. &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; is going to debut as an actual show for a one-night-only concert on January 1st, which will benefit The Actors Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmByGX"&gt;The streamed show will be produced by &lt;a href="https://seaviewprods.com/work/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical/"&gt;Seaview Productions&lt;/a&gt; (best known for producing &lt;em&gt;Slave Play&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/theater/tony-award-nominations.html"&gt;most Tony Award-nominated show&lt;/a&gt; in Broadway history) and is being presented “in association with TikTok.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMKWIG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-oral-history-1091547/"&gt;so-called &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; — based on the 2007 Disney / Pixar film — has been percolating over the past several months on TikTok. What started as a one-off bit has slowly snowballed into a massive undertaking, with bored Broadway fans, composers, set designers, costume makers, choreographers, and more working together to build bits and pieces of the (until now) fictional show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KluXDL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678" data-video-id="6885475193410620678" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@danieljmertzlufft" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft"&gt;@danieljmertzlufft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remy: The Musical OG Song @e_jaccs add.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4jUXiA"&gt;There aren’t many details yet on what the actual show will look like, although the musical promises to “celebrate the delectable crowd-sourced creation by giving it the full high-kicking, lip-smacking Broadway treatment.” Just what that means in terms of the scope of the show is, as of yet, unclear. The cast and creative team have similarly not yet been announced, although some of “Broadway’s biggest and brightest talents” are apparently involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hafpIQ"&gt;Many of the viral TikTok stars that have helped contribute to the crowdsourced show in the past few months are involved in the production, too. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blakeyrouse?lang=en"&gt;Blake Rouse&lt;/a&gt; (the composer behind two of the more popular songs on TikTok, “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjU_p3uvlkU"&gt;The Rat’s Way of Life&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvI0Lg8JmPQ"&gt;Ratatouille Tango&lt;/a&gt;”) tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his songs will be featured in the show. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tinymallet/status/1327652187980312579"&gt;Jess Siswick&lt;/a&gt; — another TikTok creator — is having her &lt;a href="https://www.playbill.com/article/presenting-the-official-fake-ratatouille-playbill"&gt;mocked-up Playbill program&lt;/a&gt; for the show appear as the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaytix.com%2Fx%2Fnyc%2Fshows%2F22803-Ratatouille--The-TikTok-Musical&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22166215%2Fratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;actual promotional artwork&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGdFSw"&gt;Two of the &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical’s original creators also appear to be involved, or at least approve of the project: both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344"&gt;Emily Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;@e_jaccs&lt;/a&gt;), who wrote the original “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;Remy the Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt;” song for TikTok, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljmertz/status/1336765015911768069"&gt;composer Daniel Mertzlufft&lt;/a&gt;, whose viral &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6885475193410620678"&gt;theatrical arrangement of that song&lt;/a&gt; helped kickstart the &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; frenzy, have both tweeted about the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGlIPL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SOOOO wild! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ratatouillemusical?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ratatouillemusical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratatousical?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ratatousical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/xgGdUSU5nB"&gt;https://t.co/xgGdUSU5nB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emily Jacobsen (@anEmilyJacobsen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uWJphu"&gt;Most importantly, though, the project appears to have Disney’s blessing: “Although we do not have development plans for the title, we love when our fans engage with Disney stories. We applaud and thank all of the online theatre makers for helping to benefit The Actors Fund in this unprecedented time of need,” notes a Disney statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0tckV"&gt;The show will stream through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaytix.com%2Fx%2Fnyc%2Fshows%2F22803-Ratatouille--The-TikTok-Musical&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22166215%2Fratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TodayTix&lt;/a&gt; on January 1st at 7PM ET, with tickets ranging from $5 to $50 (depending on the desired donation); following the premiere, the show will be available to watch on demand for 72 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic turned the volume down on ocean noise pollution</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tnNvUL"&gt;The economic fallout from COVID-19 has temporarily muted some of the noise coming from maritime traffic. That’s given scientists a rare opportunity to study what happens to marine life when humans quiet down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxZpZU"&gt;Humans today pollute oceans with whirring ship propellers and booming air guns searching for oil and gas deposits. Seeing whales and other creatures’ behavior now that the pandemic has quieted things down is like a peek into what marine life was like before humans drastically turned up the volume over the past 200 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kRh3wP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Once in a lifetime opportunity to study whale communication in natural quiet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfPG9I"&gt;“It’s like this horrible pandemic confined us humans into really small spaces but gave the whales back a lot of room to grow, both physically and acoustically,” Christine Gabriele, a wildlife biologist at Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, said in a press briefing. “I’m lucky actually to take this once in a lifetime opportunity to study whale communication in natural quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Soiwsr"&gt;Without the presence of cruise ships and tour boats that bring hundreds of thousands of visitors to Glacier Bay, Alaska, each year, humpback whales had a chance to take up more space and relax. Researchers observed them socializing and even taking naps out in the middle of channels that typically would have been loud and busy with vessels. Median daily sound levels in the bay in 2020 were 50 percent quieter than they were at the same time last year, according to Gabriele. It was so quiet, Gabriele was able to &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/soundclips.htm"&gt;listen in&lt;/a&gt; on what she believed was a long exchange between a mother and calf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWWa3J"&gt;Gabriele and other researchers are tuning into a network of hydrophones, which are basically underwater microphones, to document these changes. She was one of several scientists with the National Park Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Texas A&amp;amp;M University at Galveston who shared preliminary findings from their research today. They held a briefing on ocean noise during the annual American Geophysical Union Fall meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrl4dU"&gt;Along the coastlines of the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, ocean noise levels dropped by about 30 percent this spring, thanks to fewer vessels. Human-created noise off the shorelines of California and Massachusetts also decreased, researchers said during the briefing. They’re still conducting their studies and have yet to publish much of their work. They plan to collaborate with scientists from other regions of the world to get a better global picture of the pandemic’s effects on ocean soundscapes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Gwiwy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Research can inform policies and technological advances&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PuMafw"&gt;The researchers will also continue watching humpback whales closely. They’ll take biopsy samples from the whales to see if there are any differences in their stress hormones this year and next year. And they’re listening in on how the whales’ communication might change. They’re curious about whether whales’ vocalizations get more complex when they can hear each other better and vice versa. Studies in the past have found that whales raise their voices as ambient noise increases — just like humans might in a noisy environment — which doesn’t usually make for drawn-out exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgS2X5"&gt;There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/science/oceans-whales-noise-offshore-drilling.html"&gt;other ways&lt;/a&gt; that diverse sea life depends on sound to navigate their worlds, find food, and avoid becoming food for something else. Scientists are scrambling to make the most out of this quiet reprieve to better understand all that. The hope is that some of this research can inform policies and technological advances that might be able to keep the ocean clamor down to bearable levels in the future, even as economic activity picks back up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2klJc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
