    <title>Who wins when Amazon pulls brands from its store? </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Not the consumer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="u7KYo5"&gt;If you’re looking to buy a new USB cable, wireless charger, or that fast-charging USB power brick that didn’t come with your new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;$1,000&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; (but definitely should have), there’s a typical process many people go through. You open Amazon’s site in a new tab or the app on your phone, type in the thing you’re looking for, scan some review scores, and click Buy It Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byxqkR"&gt;Except now, some of the very best chargers, cables, and wireless pads have disappeared — products that reviewers like us independently recommended and that you could buy at more attractive prices than other brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ6Iha"&gt;Today, a search for USB-C or wireless chargers on Amazon will still turn up products from Anker, Apple, and AmazonBasics, as well as many obscure brands with alphabet-soup-style names. But you won’t find options from a bunch of popular brands that were there just a few months ago. Numerous brand lines have been wiped from Amazon’s storefront, leaving fewer, sometimes less-desirable options for consumers looking for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux0r3Q"&gt;It’s a weird situation to be in, given that Amazon has been referred to as “the everything store” for years. (Journalist Brad Stone titled his &lt;a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/brad-stone/the-everything-store/9780316219259/"&gt;first book about the company&lt;/a&gt; exactly that.) And with Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce world and status as the default shopping location for many, bolstered by its Prime service that guarantees fast delivery and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385370/amazon-prime-subscription-jeff-bezos-2020-shareholders-letter"&gt;has over 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, it means that the average person buying these things has fewer options than they did just a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucyHWoXNAHzY1hxMZ9wH9C3g4tc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026250/aukeybattery.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Aukey USB battery pack. These brands often included things like USB cables with batteries when other brands wouldn’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5GSCo"&gt;Earlier this week, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;pulled Choetech’s products&lt;/a&gt; from its store. That followed the removal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Aukey and Mpow in May&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;RavPower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;Vava, and TaoTronics&lt;/a&gt; in June, and likely others that we’re just not aware of. Amazon confirmed that it removed most of these companies’ listings, but it declined to elaborate why. Logical reasoning points to a response to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;reports that these brands were violating Amazon’s rules&lt;/a&gt; by providing incentives for positive reviews. If you’ve ever bought something on Amazon, you’ve probably seen the little cards inserted in the box offering gift cards or refunds if you post a review of the product. (If you have, my colleague Sean Hollister is collecting pictures of them for another story; you can send them to him at sean@theverge.com.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTwg58"&gt;Gaming the Amazon review system is certainly a problem, and it’s not an activity that I’m condoning. Many shoppers rely on the review scores of products when deciding whether or not to buy something. For smaller, commodity products like cables and chargers, the Amazon review rating is often the only judge of quality you might have before putting your money down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tTgtMu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies Amazon removed sold good, competitive products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNuG77"&gt;Most people would assume that companies engaging in shady activities to promote their products are doing so because the product isn’t any good in the first place. But, in a peculiar twist, that’s not the case with any of the companies I mentioned above. By and large, these companies sold good, competitive products, and put price pressure on other companies making similar devices. RavPower, Aukey, and Choetech make countless versions of the USB chargers, wireless chargers, and cables that are necessary for today’s phones, tablets, and laptops; Vava is known for its line of multiport USB-C hubs; TaoTronics and Mpow sell inexpensive headphones and earbuds that perform surprisingly well for their price. We’ve tested and recommended products from these brands here on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, as have many other publications; I’ve personally purchased numerous products made by them and have had great experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3aIcZ"&gt;These brands differentiated from the rest in a number of ways, including by offering unique designs and port configurations; packing in useful add-ons like a cable with a charger, or a charging brick powerful enough to make a wireless charger work well; or by selling the same effective thing at a lower price. The reasons we specifically called RavPower’s wireless charging pad and stand the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;best ones to buy&lt;/a&gt; were because it performed well, came with the cable and charging brick you needed to use it — a rarity among the field — and was priced better than the competition. I personally bought Choetech chargers because they came with long, high-quality USB-C cables, which you don’t typically get in the box from Anker. A two-pack of compact RavPower 20W USB-C chargers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/15/22435896/microsoft-surface-duo-foldable-android-phone-ebay-4k-tv-tcl-lg-samsung-oled-qled-deal-sale"&gt;cost me less&lt;/a&gt; than a single, bigger one from Apple and less than the similar option available from Anker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ivxf4-BoSiowyWbw-3HH3oR-29g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704521/choetech.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Choetech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A multiport hub from Choetech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z3id4W"&gt;These brands were also around long enough to have established a reputation for quality — I’m more likely to buy a charger from a brand that I’ve got experience with already than to take a flyer on one I’ve never heard of before. These were far from fly-by-night companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmirTw"&gt;Amazon’s removal of these listings is notable because unlike Anker, Belkin, Apple, and other larger brands, you can’t buy products from these companies outside of Amazon or their own websites. They don’t exist in wireless carrier stores or on Best Buy’s or Target’s virtual or in-person shelves. They are, effectively, companies that solely exist because of Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce world. (The exception here is that you now will find these brands sold by third-party sellers through Walmart, which has turned its website into a marketplace, much like Amazon. But you won’t find them at retail stores.) Some of them, like RavPower, were so reliant on Amazon that they sometimes used the retailer as a fulfillment partner for the listings on their own sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="r3Evom"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can’t easily find these brands outside of Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Akr54r"&gt;With that much of their business dependent on Amazon shoppers, it makes sense then that these outfits will do whatever they can to succeed on the platform, where an &lt;a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-now-dominates-google-in-product-search/531822/"&gt;increasing number of people are searching for products to buy&lt;/a&gt; and bypassing other stores and search engines directly. The companies paying people to post reviews of their products are trying to get more people to see what they have: By getting more positive reviews on their products, these companies will rank higher in Amazon’s search results, which will lead to more sales. A positive star rating on Amazon can make or break the success of a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOBEl2"&gt;But instead of examining why these companies are attempting to manipulate its system and making adjustments to its platform to discourage this activity, Amazon has taken a heavy-handed whack-a-mole approach to just banning those that get caught breaking its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td45hF"&gt;Amazon doesn’t seem to be interested in changing the incentives on its platform, preferring to just remove sellers it deems to be bad actors. In its &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2SYAL6T"&gt;June blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company pointed blame at social media companies for not better policing groups that collaborate to game the Amazon reviews system, and boasted that it reported over 1,000 groups in just the first three months of 2021. The company’s position is that this is how it protects shoppers from getting scammed or having a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQBhAh"&gt;But as long as sellers on Amazon are incentivized and rewarded for high star ratings and positive customer reviews on their products, there are going to be those that use tactics that Amazon doesn’t like, and come off as less than scrupulous to those buying the products. Those companies are more likely going to be smaller outfits that don’t have other retail channels or brand recognition to fall back on — even if their product is good enough to stand on its own. That is the reality of the system that Amazon has built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTpznR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So long as review scores impact how visible a product is on Amazon, sellers will try to game the system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iYazoQ"&gt;An even more cynical take on this is that Amazon is just going to supplant these retailers’ products with more of its own AmazonBasics-branded gear. The company has been caught in the past using data from what’s popular on its store to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;inform its AmazonBasics product roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon could be in the process of rolling out lower-priced versions of what Anker and Belkin are selling with its name on it, taking the place of the RavPowers and Choetechs that used to be there. I’m not convinced that this is what’s happening here, but in the service of teasing out all possibilities, there it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1zZTM"&gt;I also don’t have a handy answer for how Amazon could fix this, nor is it really my job to find a solution for one of the richest companies on the planet. Authorities in &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22443153/amazon-seller-supsensions-aukey-mpow-ftc-paid-fake-reviews"&gt;both the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550171/uk-antitrust-watchdog-investigating-amazon-google-fake-reviews"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; have started putting pressure on Amazon to fix its fake review problem, but the tactics the company has taken so far seem to lay all the blame on the sellers bending the rules, not evaluating the flaws inherent in the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DFOjJr"&gt;At the end of the day, Amazon’s policies and platform, while ostensibly protecting shoppers from fraud, end up giving consumers less choice than they would otherwise have. Until the company fixes its platform, shoppers are going to be the ones left holding the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw1trF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBLh3M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is coming to Netflix in August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJq1BeXa5mLZoMOmwx9zi4b51KM=/0x501:1500x1501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562605/E54CqchWQAc5I42.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mn5bMI"&gt;The fantasy world of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is going to expand later this summer. At WitcherCon — a new event dedicated to, obviously, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; — Netflix announced that the animated prequel &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; will debut on August 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0atuRZ"&gt;The show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077253/witcher-netflix-anime-korean-studio-mir-henry-cavill-live-action-show"&gt;which was originally announced last year&lt;/a&gt;, is being handled by Korean studio Mir — best-known for its work on shows like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt; — with &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich serving as a producer. The anime movie takes place before the events of the show, following Geralt’s mentor Vesemir. You can get a sense of the world and setting in the trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoEbKJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; debuted on Netflix at the end of 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21042869/netflix-witcher-top-10-adam-sandler-murder-mystery-stranger-things-6-underground"&gt;almost immediately became a huge hit&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the streaming service has set about turning it into a franchise; in addition to &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;a second season of the main show coming in December&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;a live-action spinoff starring Michelle Yeoh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A sealed copy of The Legend of Zelda just sold for nearly a million dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CxLePdCPteFxRU8KuXo3_1qWprs=/0x33:1796x1230/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562358/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_10.32.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JdjUAl"&gt;A sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for the NES just sold for &lt;a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/the-legend-of-zelda-wata-90-a-sealed-no-rev-a-round-soq-early-production-nes-nintendo-1987-usa/a/7261-28030.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515"&gt;$870,000 at Heritage Auctions&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the previous record for the most expensive game ever sold (as far as I am aware, at least). That record was just raised quite a bit in April when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364245/super-mario-bros-most-expensive-game-ever-record-sealed-auction"&gt;a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; was auctioned for $660,000&lt;/a&gt;, a price that more than quadrupled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;previous known record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwpMI1"&gt;As for why this version of the game is so valuable? I’m just going to leave part of Heritage Auctions’ grandiose explanation here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bnIeuM"&gt;While it is a hard truth, it is a truth nonetheless — none of the copies we’ve offered of this title previously could even attempt to hold a candle to this one due to its incredibly rare variant that holds early production status. This matter is completely inarguable. This is the only copy from one of the earliest production runs that we’ve ever had the opportunity to offer, and, possibly will have the opportunity to offer, for many years to come. Considering this variant was only produced for a few months in late 1987 before it was ultimately replaced by the “Rev-A” variant in early 1988, this statement likely comes as no surprise to collectors. Only one other variant precedes the offered “NES R” variant and that is the “NES TM” variant, which is the true first production run. However, it is also widely believed that only a single sealed “NES TM” example exists, and there is no telling whether or not that copy will ever come to market. Essentially, this copy is the earliest sealed copy one could realistically hope to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0n4a"&gt;All sorts of collectibles have taken on significantly increased value as of late. Many Pokémon cards &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/pokemon-cards-worth-a-fortune-to-collectors-and-startups-alike"&gt;are now worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;, and card grading companies are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22413108/pokemon-trading-card-collectors-overwhelm-grading-collecting-rating"&gt;drowning in Pokémon cards&lt;/a&gt;. NFTs had a hot minute there where they could sell for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;eye-poppingly huge amounts of money&lt;/a&gt;, though prices &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/nft-price-crash-what-next-for-digital-collectibles.html"&gt;appear to have fallen in recent weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4BIad"&gt;Now the question for me is: which video game will be the first to sell for more than a million?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>News Corp gives up on its ‘Knewz’ aggregator after 18 months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8WGyB_ueImawzpl9cnlVwV20B24=/0x9:1846x1240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562314/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_8.36.31_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: News Corp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hNDhz3"&gt;Knewz, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828592/knewz-news-corp-news-distribution-app-facebook-google"&gt;the news aggregation site created by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to gain some leverage against Google and Facebook’s control over what articles users read, is dead. The website, curated by a mix of artificial intelligence and real breathing editors, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewKeysLive/status/1413494562853588996?s=20"&gt;lasted just 18 months&lt;/a&gt; before shutting down, presumably because News Corp began to get concessions from both Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSzdjp"&gt;The garishly yellow front page of Knewz is gone, but you can still see &lt;a href="https://knewz.com"&gt;its farewell message&lt;/a&gt; (and a plug for other News Corp sites). According to Knewz, it had provenance, “but not profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCY-ZtqCZxkJ_uQRJ4F_kELfBvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708338/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_8.25.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knewz’ trusted news sources are News Corp entities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Byq6SE"&gt;Knewz tried to bill itself as a publisher-friendly aggregator, pulling from sources big and small across the political spectrum. If it had &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/news-corp-readies-news-app-to-address-publishers-concerns-about-google-and-facebook-11566497094?shareToken=stad0a5e159ac74cb28ac16c16c55e79b1"&gt;worked as promised&lt;/a&gt;, it would’ve favored original reporting over quick news aggregation, shared data with publishers, and skipped taking a cut of ad revenue. The problem was no one was reading the news through Knewz, and &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/knewz-murdoch-promotion-tool-coronavirus.php"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the site frequently defaulted to News Corp sources over other publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWAZVw"&gt;The timing for a Knewz shutdown makes sense, even if it seems to shatter the illusion that News Corp was doing this for anyone other than itself. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;a law supported by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt; — on News Corp’s home turf — platforms like Google and Facebook are forced to pay, and negotiate with, news publishers to display their stories. This initially did not go down well with either platform (Google threatened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;to pull its search engine from Australia&lt;/a&gt;), but ultimately both &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332658/facebook-news-corp-rupert-murdoch-deal-australia-sky-news"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; ended up striking deals with News Corp. You don’t need a weird and blunt tool like Knewz when you can just get Australian regulators to force people to pay you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US sanctions a Chinese facial recognition company with Silicon Valley funding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hitachi Kokusai Electric Surveillance System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4rb9pGNANzOTx34x7DZawQq_iI=/54x0:587x355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562257/Hitachi_Kokusai_Electric_surveillance_system_640.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4koWkl"&gt;The US Department of Commerce has &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-14656.pdf"&gt;sanctioned&lt;/a&gt; 14 Chinese tech companies over links to human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, including one backed by a top Silicon Valley investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6431e"&gt;DeepGlint, also known as Beijing Geling Shentong Information Technology Co., Ltd., is a facial recognition company with deep ties to Chinese police surveillance, and funding from US-based Sequoia Capital. Today the Commerce Department added it to its &lt;a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list"&gt;Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which restricts US companies from doing business with listed firms without a special license. Sequoia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Idm9Gv"&gt;DeepGlint co-founded a facial recognition lab in 2018 with Chinese authorities in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3008998/deepglint-chinese-ai-firm-helped-police-catch-criminal-who-had-been"&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/a&gt;. It has also gained &lt;a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202101/new-algorithm-pushes-into-biometric-accuracy-leaders-in-latest-nist-frvt"&gt;international bragging rights&lt;/a&gt; through the US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Face Recognition Vendor Test. DeepGlint claimed top accuracy in the test as of January 2021, giving it a &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-u-s-rubber-stamps-facial-recognition-systems-used-to-round-up-uighurs-in-china-595478547f86"&gt;potent marketing tool&lt;/a&gt; in the security and surveillance industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cmbBgb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bill Gates also referred to the startup as “very cool” in 2014&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnAXZc"&gt;While DeepGlint has been accepted for a public offering on Shanghai’s STAR stock exchange, the firm hasn’t seen the commercial success of other AI startups in the country, explained Jeffrey Ding in his &lt;a href="https://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-147-a-deepglint-in-the-eyes"&gt;ChinAI newsletter&lt;/a&gt; last month. Since the firm is so heavily invested in government work, it has to follow slow government procurement cycles and is unlikely to score huge infrastructure projects, Ding writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhSV8W"&gt;Sequoia Capital has funded another company that later ended up on the Entity List. In 2020, Sequoia-backed Yitu Technology was &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-u-s-rubber-stamps-facial-recognition-systems-used-to-round-up-uighurs-in-china-595478547f86"&gt;added to the list&lt;/a&gt; for similar human rights abuses. Sequoia invested in DeepGlint back in 2014, before China’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037"&gt;genocide of Uyghurs&lt;/a&gt; had come to light. (The same year, Bill Gates also referred to the startup as “very cool,” according to &lt;a href="https://kr-asia.com/deepglint-once-a-promising-chinese-ai-pioneer-is-currently-struggling-to-regain-its-glory"&gt;KrAsia&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ur7oI7"&gt;The Commerce Department also sanctioned Xinjiang Lianhai Chuangzhi Company and &lt;a href="http://www.xwsesa.com/Aboutus/index/id/7/type/English"&gt;Chengdu Xiwu Security System Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, two subsidiaries of Chinese military contractors. They both offer surveillance equipment and services, according to their websites and academic reports. Xinjiang Lianhai Chuangzhi Company created an AI-powered checkpoint system that is able to track Uyghurs as they move around cities, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ispionline.it/en/pubblicazione/how-china-uses-artificial-intelligence-control-society-23244"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Italian Institute for International Political Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hp9atD"&gt;Another firm sanctioned today is Leon Technology, a surveillance company that was controlled by Chinese AI giant SenseTime until its role &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/us-money-funding-facial-recognition-sensetime-megvii"&gt;providing oppressive technology in Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; was reported in 2019. SenseTime then divested its 51 percent stake in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSysy"&gt;The Commerce Department sanctions also included nine other Chinese companies for national security reasons, as well as companies in Iran, Russia, and Canada, among other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher’s second season is coming to Netflix on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tnyfmnOBntOK0Fkyw58VKN3eI_I=/157x0:1810x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562220/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_1.34.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="piIkSl"&gt;Sharpen your swords and get your coins ready to toss: Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) is finally back for &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s second season on December 17th, revealed at the inaugural online WitcherCon event hosted by Netflix and CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRudTK"&gt;And while Netflix hasn’t revealed a full trailer yet (fans will have to be satisfied with a behind-the-scenes clip for now) the company has shown off additional teases, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1413554612729257985"&gt;including the episode titles&lt;/a&gt; and a preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21076980/toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-stream-spotify-apple-music-netflix-soundtrack"&gt;fan-favorite coin tossing bard Jaskier’s&lt;/a&gt; new look for season 2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qqll3oUukYEkP62J1h6ki3jynoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708575/E53wYPfXsAEFX4n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YvYg0F"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; shows are based directly on the novels and short stories by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski (not developer CD Projekt Red’s popular RPG games, which are original stories set after the books, although the show’s release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21043014/netflix-the-witcher-3-henry-cavill-game-steam-twitch"&gt;did help boost a new wave of interest&lt;/a&gt; in the games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lnJxpe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix’s The Witcher is a dark, funny, and faithful adaptation of the fantasy series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FVXDJB"&gt;The second season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is just one part of Netflix’s expanded plans for the franchise: in addition to the main show, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a six-part live-action prequel miniseries that will star Sophia Brown, Laurence O’Fuarain, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;Michelle Yeoh&lt;/a&gt;. That series will focus on the original creation of the magically mutated Witchers and how the fantasy world that the story takes place in came about in the first place. Netflix is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077253/witcher-netflix-anime-korean-studio-mir-henry-cavill-live-action-show"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;an anime spinoff film that’s planned for release later in 2021 from Korean animation house Studio Mir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qP2oGY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Destiny has revealed itself. Prepare for The Witcher Season 2, premiering December 17 on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@netflix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WitcherCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WitcherCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/wx5RuCn11Z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wx5RuCn11Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Witcher (@witchernetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1413552041071362048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fLqYfB"&gt;It’s no wonder that Netflix is betting big on &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;: the show has been one of the streamer’s most popular original series and was Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;most-watched season of television&lt;/a&gt; ever when it first debuted, although that title that has since been claimed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252580/bridgerton-netflix-82-million-households-biggest-show-ever-caveats"&gt;Regency-era romance &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (That’s with the caveat that Netflix is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; generous in what it considers a watch: anyone who viewed at least two minutes of an episode of the show.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is teaming up with Tag Heuer on a Mario-themed watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRGP7FK0VnjrMZqq3x4SG-L5r6Q=/0x86:1650x1186/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69562116/Screen_Shot_2021_07_09_at_9.57.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case for Tag Heuer’s upcoming Mario-themed watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tag Heuer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SH2HMd"&gt;Nintendo, which is often associated with being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/13/8945331/satoru-iwata-obituary-nintendo-ceo-president"&gt;a toy maker&lt;/a&gt;, is teaming up with, of all companies, luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer. The two companies revealed their collaboration on an upcoming Super Mario-themed watch in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TAGHeuer/status/1413408490421465089"&gt;psychedelic teaser posted on Twitter early Friday morning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZk6hZ"&gt;You can sign up now on &lt;a href="https://www.tagheuer.com/us/en/announcement/coming-soon.html"&gt;Tag Heuer’s website&lt;/a&gt; to get early access to the “exclusive limited edition” watch which is coming “super soon.” Confusingly, Tag Heuer’s tweet says that you can “power-up on July 13th,” but the website has a clock that’s currently counting down to two days later: Thursday, July 15th at 10AM ET. If you’re interested in snagging one of these watches for yourself, you might want to register on the site to stay up to date on when you might actually be able to order one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uraPxy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Coming Super Soon!&lt;br&gt;Power-up on July 13th.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TAGHeuerxSuperMario?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TAGHeuerxSuperMario&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;For priority access, register now: &lt;a href="https://t.co/8rcnX4sCZV"&gt;https://t.co/8rcnX4sCZV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayTuned?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StayTuned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperMario?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuperMario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nintendo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/n03JXJRPYm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/n03JXJRPYm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TAG Heuer (@TAGHeuer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TAGHeuer/status/1413408490421465089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6yS9nP"&gt;The site doesn’t list any details on pricing, but from what I can tell, most Tag Heuer watches cost at least a grand, so it seems likely that this Super Mario watch won’t be cheap. And I have to say that the collaboration isn’t one I’d expect to see from Nintendo, which I wouldn’t consider a luxury brand. But I’m definitely curious as to what this watch might look like, and I’ll be keeping an eye on the official reveal next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best streaming device to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4898BPrHNtUJ2D0ryKE7CVuH4mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67310264/DSCF2108.7.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NGkXEr"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED still somehow doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pz52a6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503888"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4mn8ET"&gt;BEST STREAMING DEVICES OF 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2VmT6S"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOzUEubtlPeu7op7nTCzq0zBPLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21924603/DSCF2097_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K offers the most consistent, reliable performance of any streaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K (second-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;It’s fair to look at the Apple TV 4K as overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything the box can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;And with the 2021 model of the Apple TV 4K, Apple has finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; with a much simpler, more intuitive button layout that adds power and mute controls. It’s larger and harder to lose in the couch cushions, too. The second-gen Apple TV 4K is also now more future-proofed as a smart home hub with the inclusion of Thread support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ6Oml67NEpEL1BJiRk4Z7fw5Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360395/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zkClUu"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn is dangling a shiny new EV plant in front of Wisconsin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0b4D453mdaLFg6-7BHx2hqYL1FQ=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69561840/fisker_ocean_0134.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckmmtw"&gt;iPhone builder Foxconn is dangling a massive electric vehicle project in front of Wisconsin after burning the state with promises of a multibillion-dollar LCD factory that never happened. The Taiwanese conglomerate has also already fallen behind its own arbitrary deadline for choosing where it will build the EV factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adcA9D"&gt;The Taiwanese conglomerate said Friday that it has started talks to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) about making EVs with California startup Fisker Inc. at the mostly empty site it owns in the state. This is despite chairman Young Liu saying in March that he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;decide between building EVs in Mexico or Wisconsin by July 1st&lt;/a&gt;, and Foxconn and the WEDC agreeing to a far smaller tax subsidy package in April that reflected the failure of the LCD project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkUNcC"&gt;Why did Foxconn take a new deal with the WEDC in April when it knew it had EV ambitions in March, only to announce another negotiation with the state in July? Well, because that’s how things go with Foxconn in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WhE9U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The conglomerate could still choose Mexico or elsewhere&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dzj1q9"&gt;“As part of the site selection process, Foxconn and Fisker have engaged with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to discuss plans for electric vehicle manufacturing,” Foxconn said in a statement. Foxconn and Fisker Inc. first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;announced their partnership in February&lt;/a&gt; and have since shared that they plan to build a low-cost electric sedan, currently called Project PEAR, which stands for “Personal Electric Automotive Revolution.” The two companies signed &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210513006048/en/Fisker-and-Foxconn-Sign-Framework-Agreements-for-Project-PEAR-Confirming-Manufacturing-to-Start-in-U.S.-From-Q4-2023"&gt;a framework agreement in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3QJsR"&gt;If Foxconn ultimately does move forward with trying to build EVs in Wisconsin, it would be another huge promise to a state and a workforce that it has already mightily burned by the company. Foxconn broke ground on the Wisconsin facility in 2018 and said it would invest $10 billion and build a 20 million-square-foot factory that would pump out LCD panels. Former President Donald Trump said it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;the “eighth wonder of the world.”&lt;/a&gt; The whole effort was supposed to create 13,000 jobs. In return, the company was going to get $4 billion in tax credits and other incentives from state and local governments. The local government in Mount Pleasant demolished entire neighborhoods to clear land for the proposed factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5FtlA"&gt;But the project has languished ever since. Foxconn struggled to meet the most basic hiring goals. It has invested just 3 percent of the $10 billion that it promised, and the biggest standing facility on the property measures just 1 million square feet. The company recently agreed to reclassify the building as a storage facility in official documents, and in April, Foxconn and the WEDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393679/wisconsin-foxconn-contract-amendment-shrink"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to amend their contract to reflect the current, far more meager ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGWjnp"&gt;David Callender, a spokesperson for the WEDC, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email that it is the agency’s policy “not to comment on any discussions it may or may not have with a business unless and until a contract is executed.” The agency also cited similar grounds when it denied a public records request from the &lt;em&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; about the talks with Foxconn and Fisker Inc., the &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2021/07/08/foxconn-partner-fisker-talks-wedc-making-electric-vehicles/7909713002/"&gt;outlet reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DHnBEt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8th Wonder of the World","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DSbccD"&gt;Foxconn has spent the last year and a half racking up deals in the EV world. It has agreements with startups that have yet to put a car into production like Fisker Inc. and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese startup owned by state-run First Automotive Works. The conglomerate has also discussed making EVs with established companies like Stellantis (the company created following the recent merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Group) and the largest private automaker in China, Geely. The Geely deal may also result in Foxconn working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;with Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt; (the Chinese automaker recently negotiated a stake in the California startup). Foxconn even recently announced its own electric vehicle platform that it hopes to sell to other automakers, and it’s working with Taiwanese company Gogoro on electric scooters and battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JpZQi3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wisconsin amends Foxconn’s contract to reflect radically smaller project ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393679/wisconsin-foxconn-contract-amendment-shrink"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IY5QZW"&gt;Liu, who took over the Wisconsin project after Foxconn founder Terry Gou left the company, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-wisconsin-mexico-scott-walker-taipei-313ff82519f7ac551f1a149eebf82b4e"&gt;said in March&lt;/a&gt; that he “need[s] to find a product that fits that location.” It’s a search that has stretched on for more than a year now, as Foxconn has considered &lt;a href="https://www.wpr.org/failed-partnerships-and-vacant-buildings-foxconns-wisconsin-commitment-remains-standstill"&gt;making everything from coffee robots&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213269/foxconn-ventilators-wisconsin-plant-medtronic-pb-560-open-source-design-covid-19"&gt;ventilators&lt;/a&gt; at the facility. Still, Liu said at the time that there was no guarantee Foxconn would choose to build electric vehicles at the site. “Whether it’s Wisconsin or Mexico, it’s not political, it’s business from my perspective,” he said in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yffL6S"&gt;Wherever they wind up trying to build it, Fisker Inc. and Foxconn have said they plan to start production on the EV by the end of 2023. Fisker Inc.’s first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, is supposed to go into production in November 2022. It will be &lt;a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-and-Magna-Sign-Long-Term-Manufacturing-Agreement/default.aspx"&gt;built in Austria by automotive supplier Magna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IYVHpJ"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy5Jpj"&gt;For this week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;here are the three biggest stories: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c7BI56"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;Google faces new antitrust lawsuit over Google Play Store fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uDb4iI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model will go on sale October 8th for $350&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rt80j0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568625/stellantis-jeep-dodge-ev-day-shark-drone-autonomous"&gt;Stellantis, parent company of Dodge and Jeep, had an ‘EV Day’ and it was extremely weird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="LVVpIC"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7909667959&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvHOww"&gt;Nilay and Dieter bring back &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter Adi Robertson to discuss these topics and answer questions like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OHScpJ"&gt;Why is Samsung such a big presence in this lawsuit against Google?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="drVWoP"&gt;How much nicer does the new Nintendo Switch OLED model look and feel compared to the original model?&lt;/li&gt;
