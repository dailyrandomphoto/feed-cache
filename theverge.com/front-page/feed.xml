    <title>Former Google and Meta executive launches at-home COVID-19 test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4NXiefUqLnrl0Pqupx6GilY4NY=/600x0:7080x4320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305529/DT_Packaging_ProductSuite_C_Comp_A_Output_v001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Detect&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WVFwy"&gt;A new medical testing startup called &lt;a href="https://detect.com/our-test"&gt;Detect&lt;/a&gt; began selling at-home molecular COVID-19 tests through its website last week. The company also announced its CEO — Hugo Barra, a former executive at companies like Meta and Google who previously worked on hardware products like smartphones and virtual reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABJxLZ"&gt;The timing was sadly serendipitous — the launch coincided with a near-unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States, driven by the omicron variant. It’s nearly impossible to find an at-home test for the virus. Detect’s website shows that its tests are sold out and notes that “limited quantities” will be available at noon each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohu8Ll"&gt;“During this kind of high pressure, high tension period, where people really need these tests, we’re operating just in time — we receive inventory, we put it up for sale and literally ship it out the door,” Barra told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Right now, customers are limited to one test per household, spokesperson Anthony Ramos said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Detect’s multi-use testing platform and one single-use test sells for $75. Additional tests are $49 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jp6dLC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’re operating just in time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SG3Hoe"&gt;Detect’s tests look for the virus’s genetic material, like the PCR tests that get sent to laboratories for analysis. The company joins a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323268/covid-rapid-testing-pandemic-home-disease-pcr"&gt;handful of other groups&lt;/a&gt; making similar at-home molecular tests. They’re different from rapid at-home antigen tests, which look for proteins on the surface of the virus (and can be less accurate than molecular tests). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CPVD1"&gt;Molecular testing is an unusual career pivot for someone like Barra, who previously worked on Android product management at Google, with Chinese cellphone maker Xiaomi, and on the virtual reality team at Facebook (now Meta). He told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he started working with Detect founder Jonathan Rothberg while he was still at Meta, which he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440857/hugo-barra-leaving-facebook-ar-vr-oculus-google-xiaomi"&gt;left in May of this year&lt;/a&gt; to join Detect full-time. Barra says he was interested in taking his experiences in electronics and tech products and applying them to consumer-focused health technology. Health products often look and feel like they were designed a decade or two ago, he says, and aren’t on the same level as consumer electronic products like smartphones and virtual reality headsets in terms of their user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRDIrD"&gt;“Part of my impetus to come into the health tech world, and specifically the consumer health world, was to try and bring that sort of DNA — no pun intended — and these playbooks from the consumer electronics world,” Barra says. While Detect formed specifically to build a COVID-19 test, it aims to expand its test offerings to things like sexually transmitted infections and other respiratory illnesses, according to Barra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1Egyp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;talked with Barra about making the transition from consumer tech to health and how Detect plans to grow during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TacX70"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qcgmm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detect launched with the goal of testing for COVID-19. Are you planning to expand to other viruses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8qhTB"&gt;The platform we built can be reprogrammed to target any other sort of genetic target. We have plans to release home tests in a few different spaces. We’re building an STI test and a respiratory panel test that would look for things beyond just COVID. We’re also looking at a sore throat test, which would be helpful to help parents understand if their child has a sore throat from a bacteria or from a virus. And then there are others, which we aren’t quite ready to go into yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyCd0k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is this type of test useful for, particularly compared with rapid antigen tests, which at this point are cheaper? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCWgpy"&gt;Rapid antigen tests and rapid molecular tests both have their place in the world, and it’s a combination of both of them used in the right way that we think really becomes powerful as a public health tool. Rapid molecular tests are ones that can see the virus earlier than rapid antigen tests. It’s the one you use when you need a really high-quality answer. It also works effectively as a confirmatory test for a rapid antigen test. Antigen tests can produce false-positive results, so if you get a positive result there, confirming it with a molecular test of any sort is generally a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKOgm0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now, your tests are pretty expensive and might be cost-prohibitive for many people — especially right now, when demand is so high and people need to test frequently. Is that something you think could improve in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJqEgA"&gt;Our goal for this product is to be able to get it down to the price of a rapid antigen test. That’s what we want to be able to get to, and we think we can get there because our product is simple enough that we can make it cheaper with volume and more automation. We can definitely do that inside of 12 months and probably inside of six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cddxdz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our goal for this product is to be able to get it down to the price of a rapid antigen test&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jqh95E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is healthcare different than other areas you’ve worked in, and what have you learned over the past year and a half about those differences?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoF91n"&gt;There are two things in particular that you really have to learn quickly if you’re going to enter the consumer health world, aside from all the science. The first is quality. In the world I come from, it’s basically quality control — you test a product and make sure it won’t fail, and there are thresholds for how often it can fail. In the healthcare world, that’s a completely different ballgame. You really have to follow a pretty strict set of guidelines of quality management to ensure you’re paying attention to every step of designing and testing a product. Quite honestly, any company in the world would benefit from that — it just leads to you making better products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C4XgfY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the healthcare world, that’s a completely different ballgame&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YfoLSS"&gt;The second is regulatory. We’ve built a very healthy and successful partnership with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] in the United States, and we’re in the process of building partnerships with regulators in other parts of the world. It’s a humbling experience. These people understand what we’re building better than anyone else and sometimes even better than we do because they’ve seen it across so many companies. At the end of the day, it also forces you to build a better product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eiWXh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech companies are clearly more and more interested in the health space. Are there things that you’ve learned from this experience that you’d tell former colleagues at big tech companies about working in this area? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDgE0z"&gt;I probably would come back to the importance of really being humble and really not trying to do everything yourself. In Silicon Valley, and especially the big tech companies, there’s a general sense of “we can do everything” — because we have some of the best people in the world, and we have infinite investment. But that isn’t really enough. You really need to understand the landscape, you have to partner with public health systems, and you have to be humble. You have to build those partnerships from early days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhQxua"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8 great shows and movies from 2021 to stream on Hulu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hDxsiTFPUybJ9SgbXc0v3JFGdY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305490/RoundUpArt_HULU.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what to stream over the holidays&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qSe7Z4"&gt;When reuniting with loved ones for the holidays, a post-festivities, good old-fashioned movie night may be in order. But the massive libraries many of us have to choose from on our favorite streaming services can feel downright overwhelming — particularly when the whole family is weighing in on what to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW8cdk"&gt;For your kick-back holiday viewing this season, may we recommend a handful of titles from Hulu? Hulu is one of the more popular premium streaming services you can subscribe to, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715403/hulu-price-increase-2021"&gt;fairly affordable&lt;/a&gt; if you can live with ads. Basic Hulu (sans live TV) starts at $7 monthly or $13 per month to go ad-free. Between its originals, FX on Hulu, and its massive library of on-demand shows and movies, it’s a choice pick for anyone looking for a bit of variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewWx9D"&gt;This month, several anticipated titles are scheduled to hit the service. Whether you’re in the market for a sci-fi thriller or something to throw on for the whole family, we’ve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EBDugk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926191" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LwtcwM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MDO3Tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother/Android&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="ot3xPz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36q2jwmte40?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SOzNbY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother/Android&lt;/em&gt; stars Chloë Grace Moretz as Georgia, who, along with her boyfriend Sam (Algee Smith), must face-off against rogue androids who have revolted against their human counterparts. Georgia, who is pregnant, hatches a plan to reach safety in Boston, but the two-week journey will see Georgia and Sam going head-to-head with killer bots in order to reach their final destination before Georgia goes into labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="l1G9Cw"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hnxOwq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trolls: TrollsTopia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="KDXoKu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aezf_y871pk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qB2ey8"&gt;For anyone with little ones in tow this holiday season, all-new episodes of DreamWorks’ &lt;em&gt;TrollsTopia&lt;/em&gt; arrive this month. The animated streaming series is inspired by the &lt;em&gt;Trolls&lt;/em&gt; films and will have plenty of musical fun to keep younger viewers occupied during the holiday festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8T6C4s"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3n4qr"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; (Season 15)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="GJttN6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTGQiJ6sAxU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvw3MG"&gt;Everyone’s favorite clowns returned this month in season 15 of &lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt;. Mac (Rob McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Dee (Kaitlin Olson), and Frank (Danny DeVito) star in eight episodes for this record-breaking season, which cemented the show as the &lt;a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia"&gt;longest-running live-action sitcom&lt;/a&gt; in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJHW9I"&gt;New episodes of &lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; air Wednesdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XY7Rao"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gd7owk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="ApyEWh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yJF2cB4hHv4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5sXrfw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devs&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a new FX title — the limited series originally premiered last year (you can read &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171576/devs-review-silicon-valley-murder-fx-hulu"&gt;full review right here&lt;/a&gt;). But any sci-fi enthusiast who has yet to watch it would be wise to check it out. The mind-bending thriller is set on the remote campus of tech startup Amaya and follows software engineer Lily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno) as she seeks answers about a mysterious murder. Nick Offerman stars as Forest, the eccentric CEO of Lily’s employer and the mastermind behind a new technology that could forever alter Lily’s world as she knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vaD9q7"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l9DP6L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nowhere Inn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="Qq7j1H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7igJaXJreU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aIhZe"&gt;Carrie Brownstein and Annie Clark (known musically as St. Vincent) star in this mockumentary about a musician who teams with a friend to document her life as a performing artist. But when both become fixated on their ideas of which sides of Clark’s persona should be captured on film, the two find themselves navigating increasingly distressing creative landmines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4wVcJC"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qwL9iU"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pen15&lt;/em&gt; (Season 2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="SSuMat"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFAHiU0g0xQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ohWMH5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pen15&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the best choice for a family-friendly viewing affair, but the raunchy teen dramedy about teens Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine captures the hilarious if not painfully awkward experience of navigating teenaged social dynamics. New episodes of season 2 premiered on Hulu on December 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="aiihph"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3fT5jL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Letterkenny&lt;/em&gt; (Season 10)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="9HAStK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGxYBiuvkUw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w5GBUF"&gt;The oddballs of the Letterkennyverse are back just in time for your post-Christmas holiday binge. The small-town comedy series returns for its tenth season on December 26th on Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PC6QQL"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Tiy2qy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="HmkV5t"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5gD0UzXTdw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6DSxbt"&gt;Looking for a binge-worthy, holiday-themed reality series? In this Jackie Sorkin-hosted challenge series, candy artists team up to develop a fully functional, 1,000-square-foot house that’s crafted entirely out of candy — with no surface left un-candified. The artists will have six weeks to build their dream candy home. The series debuted on Hulu on December 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> T-Mobile’s 5G Home Internet: I tried it, and it tried me</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Is cellular good enough for a home internet connection?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZyAzmr"&gt;I was interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile’s Home Internet service&lt;/a&gt; from the first time I heard about it: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711794/t-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut"&gt;$50 (a price that includes the specialized router)&lt;/a&gt;, contract and data cap-free, and is powered by 5G and LTE instead of phone lines or cable. As many people in the US can probably relate, I’m not in love with my traditional ISP — I often push up against its 1.2TB data cap, and $80 per month feels like a lot to pay for the supposedly 400Mbps service I get. So I wondered: could I, a remote worker and heavy internet user who likes to stream video, play multiplayer games, and do cloud backups, actually be fine with internet delivered through the air instead of a cable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axXVco"&gt;After a few weeks of testing, it seems like the TL;DR answer is no; despite &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s site&lt;/a&gt; telling me my address is eligible, the router almost always had a “weak” cellular signal, and there were so many drop-outs and slowdowns that even my non-techie wife was fed up with it after a few weeks. The thing about cellular internet, though, is that my experience won’t necessarily be the same as yours, even if you live a few blocks away from me. So take this review for what it is: one person’s experience with what the service is like in one tiny, non-specific part of eastern Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdvDSP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10926344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="qZ6EeW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Five things to consider before you sign up for T-Mobile Home Internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6UgddWWUxLMIYc4hj811jPDX8oI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086507/mclark_211109_4928_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s router has decent I/O, but the most interesting ports don’t work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLzGp6"&gt;Before we get into the particulars of my experience, though, let’s start with what’ll be universal to those using the service: the router hardware and setup process. The router supports Wi-Fi 6, which is nice to see, and has a small circular touchscreen on top that you can use to see various statistics like how many devices are connected to your network and how good its cellular connection is. On the back, there’s a place to plug in the (frankly massive) power brick, two Ethernet ports, a power button, and a few pins that let you plug in a battery backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqUwQu"&gt;Looking at that picture, you may be just as excited as I was when you see that there’s a USB-C port. I have no idea why the router’s manufacturer, Nokia Solutions &amp;amp; Networks, put it there, but it and the RJ-11 phone port are currently non-functional, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fpublic-files%2Fattachments%2FT-Mobile%2520High-Speed%2520Internet%2520Gateway%2520End%2520User%2520Guide.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22838200%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-5g-cellular-connection-cable-review-gaming-work-from-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the router’s manual&lt;/a&gt; (pdf). Bummer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RncpqR"&gt;After you plug the router in and turn it on, it’ll prompt you to download T-Mobile’s app using a QR code displayed on its screen. I had a lot of frustrations with the app at first, until I realized that I had to connect to the router’s Wi-Fi network before hitting the “setup device” button. As far as I can tell, that step isn’t included in the quick setup guide, nor is it hinted at in the app itself. The setup process was a breeze after I figured that out, though, with the app prompting me to choose a name for my network and to set a password (the default name and password are printed on the bottom of the device if you’d rather just leave it as-is). Then, the app told me it was time to find a good spot to put the router where it could pick up a strong signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mhjayubdszaq6huIKXOa7OOgdYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086515/mclark_211213_4928_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My search for signal didn’t go great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJDoddVDl6Wp_MGWQXiyMyq7uhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086512/mclark_211211_4928_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The router’s power brick is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxzQzT"&gt;That process was actually quite fun. The router has a battery in it, so you can walk around with it and test out the signal strength in different spots. (The battery doesn’t seem to work as a backup power source, though. If it’s not plugged into power, you won’t be getting any Wi-Fi.) As I mentioned before, though, this feature didn’t help me out much; upstairs or downstairs, right next to a window or in the absolute middle of my house, I got a steady two bars of service (out of five) — even taking it outside didn’t help, not that I could’ve left if there had I gotten perfect signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwBhLT"&gt;The app doesn’t make it clear if you’re using LTE or 5G, but digging into the router’s web GUI, you can see what cellular bands it’s making use of. After Googling band designations, I was able to determine that, at time of writing, the router was primarily connected to LTE and was using 5G as a secondary connection. Of course, as T-Mobile says on its site, that could change based on “signal strength and availability, time of day, and other factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The T-Mobile router’s status screen, displaying that the primary signal was on the B2 band, and the secondary signal was on the n41 band." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXOiN5NyMsvNXQejGM3TfJrE1yU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099655/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_12.52.13.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can figure out where your signal is coming from, with a bit of digging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DzCEBE"&gt;I ended up putting the router in what I felt like would be the most advantageous place: on a windowsill upstairs, facing the city. From there, all that was left to do was unplug my current access point (I didn’t want it to talk over the T-Mobile router) and plug my switch into my new cell-powered router to get all of my hardwired IoT devices connected to my new home network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe8klf"&gt;At first, everything seemed all right. I was getting download speeds anywhere from 73 to 135 Mbps, and I even saw upload speeds as high as 20 Mbps. For the first day or two, I really didn’t encounter any issues — when it came to actually using the internet, it seemed to be the exact same experience as when it was coming in over the wire (and Siri could even play Apple Music on my HomePods, something that’s completely broken on my normal setup for some reason). The router also performed admirably — my laptop’s internet was just as fast in my office right next to the router as it was in my living room, which is downstairs and across the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjOamWvfftJV6BkdGJXM9u4V9lQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099744/Screen_Shot_2021_12_15_at_13.23.48.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For $50 a month, it’s hard to complain about these results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUE454"&gt;Slowly, though, hiccups started to pile up. Webpages would occasionally struggle to load, or I’d switch channels in Slack and notice that everybody’s profile pictures were grey squares until their actual smiling faces loaded in one by one (which is how I learned that Slack doesn’t seem to cache those images, for some reason). Once, the speeds were so abysmal that it took Twitter a literal minute to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmk9Xr"&gt;There were even a few periods where the internet would seemingly just be gone for a few minutes at a time, with my web browser immediately telling me that it couldn’t connect when I tried to navigate to a site. The frequency of the outages or slowdowns varied — some days, I only had occasional glitches, and a few days, the internet was basically unusable. There weren’t a ton of perfect days, but they did happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LkVXWn1va8kEhJmH79DSZKh_jpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099757/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_21.12.27.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This result, though, is less ideal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l2A2qC"&gt;From what I can tell, this was almost always an issue with the actual service and not the router (though there was one abnormally long outage that did appear to be a router issue, as it was fixed as soon as I rebooted the machine). I could send packets between the devices in my house just fine — I was just cut off from the outside world. I asked T-Mobile what could’ve caused these issues, and it told me that “while you might see slower speeds during times certain times of the day, due to network congestion, 30 seconds to load a webpage doesn’t sound like a normal experience.” I asked for ideas as to what may have caused it but didn’t receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTMOdT"&gt;As someone expected to be ready to jump on breaking news at any moment, this was obviously not ideal for my use case. I’m sure my boss and coworkers got annoyed with how often I said something along the lines of “okay, I’ll grab that as soon as my internet starts functioning again.” The unreliability also caused issues in my personal life, too — when trying to watch YouTube with my wife, she’d occasionally comment on the “potato resolution.” (Mind you, this is someone who is perfectly content watching DVDs.) I would also run into issues trying to play online games, with my ping swinging like a pendulum from a usable ~30ms to an unplayable 900ms. You can see the results of that in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BCmWyx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What that kind of performance looks like in-game. As a heads up, there is some violence in the clip, so you may not want to watch it if you’re sensitive to that kind of thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5xpMU"&gt;It’s not that T-Mobile Home Internet never worked. I’d say the majority of the time, it was perfectly fine. I was able to play several hours of multiplayer &lt;em&gt;CoD&lt;/em&gt; during my testing, and for the most part, I was shocked that the experience could be as good as it was over cellular. I was also able to do some perfectly acceptable video calls with friends and family. When my service was working, I genuinely couldn’t tell the difference between it and my normal cable provider. It’s just that I couldn’t rely on it working that well, and as someone who works from home, that’s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DCBcHD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10926399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wvunmr"&gt;I was hoping to switch to T-Mobile’s home internet if my tests went well — I’m not the type of person who needs to have a screaming fast 200 Mbps plus connection and am even willing to put up with a little spotiness if it means not having to pay $80 a month for Comcast and its data caps. But the first time I got the notification on my computer telling me that my phone’s battery was dead because I’d been tethering to it all day, I knew those hopes had been dashed. (It would’ve been awkward if my phone ran off T-Mobile, but I’m on the Verizon-powered Visible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sNI7g6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, it did feel ironic having to use cellular internet because my cellular internet wasn’t working&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o2Buei"&gt;That doesn’t mean T-Mobile’s internet won’t work for anyone — I may have had a better experience had I been able to get more than two bars of service at my house (though the app usually showed that it still had two bars of signal during outages), and for some people, even the worst of what I experienced would be better than what they’re currently using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dPj7n"&gt;When I was using DSL a year ago, I still probably would’ve chosen T-Mobile over it — the two connections were similarly reliable, but I got faster speeds over cellular when it was working than I used to get over the phone lines. For people who live in an even more rural setting than I do and rely on the internet less, T-Mobile’s internet could be a huge upgrade from dial-up or extremely spotty satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNPrtO"&gt;Speaking of satellite internet, there’s an obvious comparison between T-Mobile’s service and SpaceX’s Starlink; both promise home internet without the need for infrastructure coming to your house. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;wasn’t pleased when he tried out the Starlink beta&lt;/a&gt;, and the service is significantly more expensive than T-Mobile’s: you have to pay $499 plus shipping for a satellite dish and $99 a month for the service. But Starlink does promise higher speeds, saying you can expect 100Mbps to 200Mbps downloads. While T-Mobile says that many users can expect “speeds in excess of 100Mbps,” it says that the average is “between 35-115 Mbps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="hUJFvh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither service excelled for us, but they could get better if they continue to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot8K5C"&gt;There are other pros and cons for each service. Installing Starlink’s satellite dish is significantly more invasive than plugging in T-Mobile’s router, and I doubt my apartment complex would ever be okay with me sticking something on the roof (even with Starlink’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites"&gt;new, smaller design&lt;/a&gt;). And T-Mobile’s service uses the cell towers that also provide service to our phones — Starlink &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;wants to put 12,000 satellites into orbit&lt;/a&gt; to power its service, potentially obstructing our view of the cosmos. But if your house is in an area without reliable cell service, T-Mobile obviously isn’t going to be an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29L0sB"&gt;It’s conceivable that T-Mobile’s home internet could get better over time — when compared to building out traditional internet infrastructure, adding 5G capacity to cell towers requires much less physical labor. I want to break up with my ISP so badly that I may give T-Mobile another chance every year or two to see if it’s improved to the point that I could use it. The company makes that easy — it’s a no-contract service, so it’d only cost me $50 to get an entire month to give it another shot. If you live at an eligible address and are curious about cellular internet, it may be worth at least giving it a shot. You may end up having a much better experience than I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oaqmi7"&gt;For now, though, I’ll be sadly trudging back to Comcast. It seems that my dream of $50 unlimited internet was just too beautiful to come true in 2021. If you’re thinking of trying it out for yourself, be sure to read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;our list of considerations&lt;/a&gt; before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s AWS logs third outage this month, affecting Slack, Epic Games Store, Asana and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcfUAN03InB_0UTKa7CYDLIq97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305351/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuvhOy"&gt;Amazon’s crucial web services business AWS is experiencing problems today, with issues affecting services like Slack, Imgur, and the Epic Games store for some users. It’s not looking good if you’re working from home, with some Slack users unable to view or upload images, and work management tool Asana also hit by the outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMi62F"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-12/a17eae991fdc437d"&gt;incident update&lt;/a&gt;, Slack said its services are “experiencing issues with file uploads, message editing, and other services.” Asana says the problems constitute a “&lt;a href="https://status.asana.com/incidents/xm08pc5v6mlk"&gt;major outage&lt;/a&gt;,” with “many of our users unable to access Asana.” Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1473644098632441860"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “Internet services outages” are “affecting logins, library, purchases, etc.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJBnzJ"&gt;It’s the third time in as many weeks that problems with AWS have had a significant effect on online services. Two incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837637/aws-west-is-down-twitch-outage-amazon"&gt;involving AWS&lt;/a&gt; ended up knocking out a huge array of platforms and products, taking out streaming sites like Netflix and Disney Plus as well as smart home devices like security cameras from Ring and Wyze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gT4U31"&gt;Today’s outages seem less widespread but still notable, with some users unable to access services entirely and others merely experiencing intermittent faults. &lt;a href="http://DownDetetector.com"&gt;DownDetector.com&lt;/a&gt; shows reports of issues with the platforms mentioned above, as well as news aggregator Flipboard, online learning site Udemy, dating app Grindr, streaming service Hulu, and IoT services from Honeywell, Life360, and Samsung’s SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAowQB"&gt;The official &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS service health dashboard&lt;/a&gt; said at 4:35AM PST that the company was “investigating increased EC2 launch failures and networking connectivity issues for some instances in a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region,” before updating at 5:01AM PST to confirm that power loss has affected “a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIzXbl"&gt;“Connectivity and power to other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, or other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region are not affected by this issue, but we would recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) if you are able to do so,” notes AWS in an update statement. “We continue to work to address the issue and restore power within the affected data center.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6IIXH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Wednesday, December 22nd, 08:36AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story to add responses from affected services. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk: metaverse isn’t ‘compelling’ and Web3 ‘more marketing than reality’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B57EFAEDZn3YjaHhz9z0IcTw-gc=/0x254:3926x2871/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305222/1234657391.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILHVa9"&gt;The metaverse and Web3 are two trends supposedly set to revolutionize the digital world. But the richest man IRL, Elon Musk, is not keen on either. In a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BaRKd4U6Ixg"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO said he couldn’t see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, and derided Web3 — a nebulous concept in which internet services are rebuilt around blockchain and cryptocurrency — as “more marketing than reality,” adding “I don’t get it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iAyTA"&gt;Musk admitted that he might just be “too old” to understand these new technologies. “Am I like one of those people who was dismissing the internet [in] ‘95 as some fad or something that’s never going to amount to anything?” he suggested, before noting that in 1995 he was very much one of the individuals who understood the potential of the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J7YY3Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANMMa8"&gt;Musk’s criticism of the metaverse focused on a lack of compelling use-cases and a disappointing experience for consumers. “Sure you can put a TV on your nose. I’m not sure that makes you ‘in the metaverse,’” he said. “I don’t see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day and not wanting to ever leave. That seems — no way.” He later added: “I currently am unable to see a compelling metaverse situation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qkr6xh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is the metaverse, and do I have to care?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4FdL9m"&gt;Right now, the “metaverse” is mostly an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;over-hyped branding exercise&lt;/a&gt; for a series of virtual worlds, some of which are dependent on VR headsets to access. Critics point out that we’ve basically tried all this technology before, with the failed VR boom of the ‘90s and the rise of spaces like &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;in the early 2000s. What this current iteration mainly offers is improved hardware, a flashy new title, and billions of dollars of backing from giants like Facebook-owned Meta, keen to control what they see as the next big digital platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faskVL"&gt;Web3 is another alternative vision for the future of the internet, with much boosterism driven by the idea that ordinary internet users will be able directly profit from their content and activity online (rather than having this value captured by a few behemoth internet companies). Musk didn’t spend much time discussing Web3, but he’s previously expressed skepticism about the project on Twitter, joining fellow tech CEO Jack Dorsey. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848162/jack-dorsey-web3-criticism-a16z-ownership-venture-capital-twitter"&gt;Dorsey’s criticism&lt;/a&gt; is that Web3 won’t democratize anything, but will simply shift power from existing incumbents like Facebook to upstart venture capital funds like Andreessen Horowitz.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwuDv7"&gt;Elsewhere in the interview with &lt;em&gt;The Babylon Bee — &lt;/em&gt;a conservative and Christian humor site — Musk discussed &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jvGnw1sHh9M?t=2580"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; (“I’m not in the camp of super-alarmist global warming,” he said, but added that negative effects like rising sea levels are “not a wise risk to take”), the existence of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jvGnw1sHh9M?t=3236"&gt;other life in the universe&lt;/a&gt; (“If anyone would know about evidence of aliens it would be me, and I’ve seen nothing”) and said there should be a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jvGnw1sHh9M?t=3625"&gt;regulatory agency&lt;/a&gt; to oversee “advanced AI” that he thinks poses a threat to humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObCjK8"&gt;In the beginning of the episode, Musk also took time to compare &lt;em&gt;The Babylon Bee&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;, which he said had gotten too “politically correct” and “leftist.” (It’s worth noting that Musk used to be a &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-wanted-to-buy-the-onion-now-hes-poaching-its-staffers-for-a-secret-project"&gt;huge fan of &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but changed his mind &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1375214332028444674"&gt;when the publication made fun of him.&lt;/a&gt;) Musk said that &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt; had got “the woke mind virus,” which he &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BaRKd4U6Ixg?t=670"&gt;later described&lt;/a&gt; as “arguably one of the biggest threats to modern civilization.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor teases its first foldable, the Magic V</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2pwUinsJGQl1dhcvrq1b99SY2w=/0x0:9999x6666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304931/HONOR_Magic_V.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0burOg"&gt;Former Huawei sub-brand Honor has teased the launch of its first foldable smartphone, the Honor V. An image shared &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/L7bOzxmnz?pagetype=profilefeed&amp;amp;layerid=4717137157950853"&gt;on its Weibo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1473563964340678658"&gt;Twitter accounts&lt;/a&gt; teases the design of the device, showing a telltale hinge between the two halves of the device. The Weibo post says the “folding flagship is about to be released,” though no exact launch date has been announced and Honor declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b12PHd"&gt;Honor has been open about its desire to release a foldable for some time. As early as 2019, the company’s CEO George Zhao &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/honor-ceo-wants-to-launch-5g-phone-in-2019-foldable-phone-in-2020/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was interested in producing a foldable under the Honor brand, but expressed concerns that the device would be too expensive for Honor’s younger target market. In June this year, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-foldable-phone-report-dscc/"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; that development of such a device was underway at the company, and that its folding display panels were being provided by BOE and Visionox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hL8goF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Unfold all the potential. This is HONOR’s first foldable flagship phone, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HONORMagicV?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HONORMagicV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kijORIGxg1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kijORIGxg1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HONOR (@Honorglobal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1473563964340678658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGNVMH"&gt;There aren’t many details on the exact form the Magic V could take, but a &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3064"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests it could have an 8.03-inch folding inner display paired with a 6.45-inch outer screen. That suggests a device that resembles Samsung’s Z Fold devices (which unfold from a phone form factor into a tablet) rather than its Z Flip (a phone that folds to become more compact). That’s also the form factor used by Honor’s former parent company Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;with its Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, though now that Honor has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;independent for a year&lt;/a&gt; it’s unclear how similar its upcoming device might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOsB69"&gt;Honor joins an expanding list of companies that have either released, or are planning to launch their own foldables. Samsung and Huawei were two early entrants, but more recently we’ve seen foldables from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and Oppo, which officially announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price"&gt;Find N phone&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. As well as Honor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22735454/google-foldable-phone-pixel-fold-pixel-6-samsung"&gt;Google is also rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be planning to announce as many as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;two foldables&lt;/a&gt; of its own in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 starts to fall apart as T-Mobile, Amazon, and others bail on in-person conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;Another year, another gigantic tech tradeshow that looks like it may be falling apart as the COVID-19 pandemic continues — now that T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;has publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; that his company won’t be attending the world’s largest electronics show next month. Amazon has also decided not to attend the show in-person, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CIAE17"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;T-Mobile, Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio have all announced this week that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But T-Mobile is the first major attendee to bail, with companies like Twitter and even Meta having a far more muted presence at the show in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BhyCbS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgCexR"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung and GM, which also have featured keynotes, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like Intel, LG, Panasonic and Sony. We’re asking major companies now if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend as of earlier today, and LG said that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” LG, however, won’t have a traditional booth, as it’s said it’ll be making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that AMD and Samsung are still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus and HTC still plan to attend. Sony, Samsung and Google are all listed as “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;This morning, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” stretch on for some time. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZhLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:09 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Amazon and LG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL resumes selling its Google TVs after rolling out software fixes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ILl9cFmcKCQahDVwdejWRg4y5NA=/20x0:2168x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304410/327063D4_692F_4275_A45A_6A2026E0BFEF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XSuaHS"&gt;After briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826619/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-best-buy-removal-os-bugs-slow"&gt;halting sales of its 6-Series and 5-Series Google TVs&lt;/a&gt; due to sluggish, buggy software, TCL this evening announced that the TVs are back. “Recent software updates have allowed us to make significant improvements on the stability and speed of the TCL televisions featuring Google TV,” spokesperson Rachelle Parks said by email. “With these updates, this product now represents the powerful performance that TCL and Google believe is the future of TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTfkgI"&gt;The Google TVs represent TCLs effort to take a platform agnostic approach with its TV hardware; the company is best known for its popular sets that come preloaded with Roku software, but it has also manufactured Android TV products. The 6-Series (R646) and 5-Series (R546) are the company’s first TVs with the newer Google TV interface, however, and early buyers complained of slow performance and some significant bugs when operating the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFJ4nh"&gt;I can report that the 6-Series unit I’ve been reviewing just received yet another software update today, and this seems to be the version that TCL thinks is up to snuff for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6KZ6S"&gt;The 6-Series Google TV offers improved hardware over the Roku TV version: the Google model has full HDMI 2.1 support for 4K gaming at 120Hz, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuShx0"&gt;Stay tuned for our full review now that TCL has resumed sales of its premium Google TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGXbZr"&gt;TCL’s full statement is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E0qbFc"&gt;TCL is committed to delivering premium products with world-class experiences and the new product featuring Google TV is certainly no different. Recent software updates have allowed us to make significant improvements on the stability and speed of the TCL televisions featuring Google TV. With these updates, this product now represents the powerful performance that TCL and Google believe is the future of TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5OC3pg"&gt;Owners of the TCL Google TVs should be prompted to update their sets to the latest firmware automatically, but they can also manually get the update by &lt;a href="https://support.tcl.com/en_US/perform-software-update-gtvs"&gt;following this process&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new 16:18 monitor looks like a multitasking powerhouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVNWPAC4X6Ycy-L8nVHxgBRCsFw=/93x0:1085x661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304258/LG_DualUp_Lifestyle_00.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J9ivA9"&gt;Are monitors with traditional aspect ratios just not getting the job done for you? LG might have the answer. Today the company has announced what it touts as “a completely new format in the monitor market” called the DualUp. With a unique 16:18 aspect ratio, LG claims the DualUp gives you “the same screen real estate as two 21.5-inch displays and has a vertical split view function that lets users see more in one glance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnqeJY"&gt;With a resolution of 2560x2880 and measuring 27.6 inches on the diagonal, the DualUp (model 28MQ780) tops out at 300 nits of brightness and covers 98 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It attaches to LG’s included Ergo stand, which can clamp to “most” desks and tables to save on space. Aside from the productivity and creative possibilities opened up by this form factor, LG claims the double-height display has ergonomic benefits since it “helps reduce side-to-side head movements, the main cause of neck pain.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pivP0f"&gt;If you’re not into the idea of having multiple displays in your working space, this thing should make it easier to multitask while keeping an eye on Slack, Microsoft Teams, and so on. And as the marketing images show, it seems like a dream for video editors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hm-icD2LZYwj9YPX5IGVnLxIKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23118778/dualup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DualUp monitor has a resolution of 2560x2880.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c82vg8"&gt;LG isn’t yet disclosing pricing for the DualUp, but this isn’t the only new monitor that the company is introducing today. There’s also the 4K 32-inch UltraFine display. This one keeps things more ordinary with a 16:9 aspect ratio, but LG is taking up its “first Nano IPS Black panel” and says this display can output “realistic and nuanced black tones.” The UltraFine can crank a little brighter than the DualUp with a peak of 400 nits and also has a 2000:1 contrast ratio compared to the 1,000:1 of the more unconventional display. LG also includes a self-calibration sensor to ensure you’re seeing accurate color tones when editing photos or video or working on graphic design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XsMAK8"&gt;Both of LG’s new monitors include two HDMI ports, one upstream USB-C port (for your computer), and two downstream USB-C ports — but they aren’t Thunderbolt ports, unfortunately. They can charge external devices like laptops at up to 96 watts through USB power delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9DiYMAF3jfTXFfTH3ze2GG0B5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23118803/LG_UltraFine_Lifestyle_00.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new 32-inch 4K UltraFine monitor also supports variable refresh rate via AMD FreeSync. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p id="wIBgka"&gt;The company says it will share more details on both products during its virtual CES 2022 presentation on January 4th. LG has already made pre-show announcements including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832356/lg-stanbyme-portable-tv-objet-announced-design-specs"&gt;battery-powered TV that can be wheeled around your home&lt;/a&gt; and a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841919/lg-s95qr-soundbar-ces-2022-with-upward-firing-center-channel"&gt;soundbar with an upward-firing center channel&lt;/a&gt; designed to improve speech clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models seems too expensive, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a decent entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and solid build quality — especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range — but it’s also not one we would recommend picking up at this point. The design is aging, the processor is slower, and its paltry 8GB of internal storage hampers some of the more recent features introduced to the Apple Watch, like the ability to store music and podcasts for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgdJbF1VDYU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1159614/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Gen-3-Series-3-38mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Black-Sport-Band-MTF02LL-A%2F706203065%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26wl13%3D3464%26adid%3D22222222277706203065_117755028669_12420145346%26wmlspartner%3Dwmtlabs%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D501107745824%26wl4%3Dpla-293946777986%26wl5%3D9031583%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Dlocal%26wl12%3D706203065%26wl13%3D3464%26veh%3Dsem_LIA%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAk4aOBhCTARIsAFWFP9G_TJDKORUhNa3G4U_DqxBh1QR7hWzDkHW_YAg_-0cShPcKnvnxfPsaAgq9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s also on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Both models are available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for around the same price, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ryWZk"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped Watch SE with the gold aluminum case and the blue Sport Band for $229 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The same size configuration is available at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229766/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; with either the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207183/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F758438118&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold case and the starlight Sport Band&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1159614/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F645876604&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray aluminum case and the midnight Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $10 shy of the lowest price we’ve ever seen this model go for. Walmart also is selling the larger, 44mm model with the space gray aluminum case and the midnight Sport Band for $&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207219/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F634481974&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;259&lt;/a&gt; instead of $309.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. Right now, the 40mm, GPS-enabled model is selling for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207177/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F361742962" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$349&lt;/a&gt; at Walmart in both the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F361742962&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; colorways. If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart in red&lt;/a&gt; for $299 instead of $429.99, one of its best prices to date. Walmart is also selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207219/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F361742962&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver, 40mm model&lt;/a&gt; with GPS for $349 instead of $399.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. Right now, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model in green for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$339&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, its lowest price to date, or one of the other colors for $349 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F728333046&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640160%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
