    <title>DraftKings announces it will now allow betting on drone races in some states</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0z1ast"&gt;Sports betting company DraftKings and the Drone Racing League (DRL)  will now allow betting on drone races in some states, the two &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-drone-racing-league-and-draftkings-take-flight-with-official-sports-betting-agreement-ahead-of-season-finale-races-301203192.html"&gt;companies announced&lt;/a&gt;. DRL, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/draftkings-and-drone-racing-league-partnership-lets-you-bet-on-drone-races.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; describes&lt;/a&gt; as a first-person view racing league, allows pilots to compete for prizes by flying their drones through courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRta0L"&gt;Residents of Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia will be able to bet on the races via their phones, and regulatory approval is pending for betting on drone races in other states, the companies said. The terms of the deal and the amounts of the prize money weren’t disclosed, but drone racers &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/drone-racing-is-worth-100000-in-upcoming-championship.html"&gt;in a 2017 tournament&lt;/a&gt; competed for $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eN4af"&gt;“The sky is now the limit for DRL fans to get skin in the game, and we’re thrilled to partner with DraftKings to transform our high-speed race competition into the ultimate sport to bet on,” DRL President Rachel Jacobson said in a statement. According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;, drones used in the events are built by DRL, and each one is worth about $2,000. The league has deals for media rights to the races with NBC Sports and Sky Sports, and a streaming arrangement with Twitter to host its preflight shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZcbws"&gt;DraftKings first introduced DRL drone races last year as a kind of test run, and says response was better than expected. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellore/2021/01/08/drone-racing-league-partners-with-draftkings/?sh=40faf1572a71"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first free-to-play pool in November drew more than 150,000 entrants. DRL was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fespn%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F13431957%2Fproponents-see-huge-potential-drone-racing-league&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F9%2F22222051%2Fdraftkings-drl-betting-drone-races#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;established in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5H8Cj"&gt;The first races, part of the 2020 DRL Allianz World Championship Season, are slated for Saturday at 4:30PM ET on NBC, Twitter, and Facebook. DRL and DraftKings will host pre-flight shows ahead of the live events to give fans details on how to participate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s 2021, and the pandemic is still here </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dodger Stadium COVID-19 testing site, which is the largest in the U.S., will reopen today after a weekend closure for restructuring to alleviate traffic in the area.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHWLA1"&gt;I regret to inform you that even with all of the other news happening this week, there is still a pandemic going on. It would have been great to sweep it out the door with the old planners and dead Christmas trees. But it’s 2021, and COVID-19 is still here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0l3wX"&gt;More than a year after this &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-virus-discovered-by-chinese-scientists-investigating-pneumonia-outbreak-11578485668"&gt;coronavirus made its big debut&lt;/a&gt;, it’s bigger than ever. Days after it was sequenced on January 7th, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/"&gt;there were 41 cases in China&lt;/a&gt; and one death. A year later, the toll now stands at 88,617,915 infected, and 1,907,608 dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="w91RX9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zFg5oT"&gt;Those numbers are rising rapidly. One in 30 Londoners has COVID-19, London Mayor Sadiq Khan &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MayorofLondon/status/1347530789710426113"&gt;tweeted on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. New &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html"&gt;variants of the virus&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be more transmissible, are spreading in the UK, South Africa, and around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4KcZN"&gt;The US broke records for COVID-related deaths multiple days this week, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/world/fauci-coronavirus-january.html"&gt;topping 4,000 on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe things will get worse as we get into January,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/07/954324536/december-was-pandemics-deadliest-month-vaccine-process-has-been-slow"&gt;told NPR&lt;/a&gt;. “Now’s not the time to pull back on this.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O28Jnr"&gt;It’s the time to speed up the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines. It’s time to keep wearing masks and keep our distance from one another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2H3IOz"&gt;It’s time to prioritize ending the pandemic that stole last year before it takes over this one, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWgu3O"&gt;Hindsight is 20/20. Let’s see if we learned anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL5wsO"&gt;Here’s what else is going on this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JiYo3P"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1nsy03"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/health/coronavirus-variant-tracking.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Is Blind to Contagious New Virus Variant, Scientists Warn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A national surveillance program could help track the new variants, but that kind of program doesn’t yet exist in the US. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"&gt;quirk in some COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; could help labs look for the variant, but they fall short of a more widespread system. (Carl Zimmer, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRAc9R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22215121/new-variants-contagiousness-covid-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why epidemiologists are so worried about the new COVID-19 variants, in 2 charts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This breaks down why the new variants are particularly worrying for experts tracking the new strains. In short: if they are more easily transmissible, it’s easier for more people to get sick or die. (Brian Resnik, &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzeQwS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/08/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-mutation-contagious/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine not affected by mutation seen in contagious coronavirus variant, study indicates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Early research suggests that the Pfizer vaccine may be effective against one of the mutations found in some of the worrying variants. This is a good early sign, but the &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.07.425740v1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was small and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445645/coronavirus-covid-19-studies-problems-limitations"&gt;has not been reviewed by outside experts&lt;/a&gt;. (Andrew Joseph, &lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

They had just two hours to safely administer 600 doses of the Moderna vaccine. Incredibly, they did it. (Anita Chabria, &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To speed up, we’ll need more money, more vaccines, and more communication with the public. (Selena Simmons-Duffin and Pien Huang, &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqqlFm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22214865/covid-vaccine-schedule-doses-fda-uk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FDA tells US health providers not to modify COVID-19 vaccine dose schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The FDA told providers that they should stick to the two-dose schedule for the vaccines that have been authorized in the US. Other countries, including the UK, have decided to delay the second dose, in an effort to vaccinate more people. (Nicole Westman, &lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Adrianna Rodriguez, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHk1WQ"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qGLYWI"&gt;It’s an enviable kind of know-how, the muscle memory of care. But like so much in medicine, it comes with complications, the everyday rifts that open up between your world and others’, the repetitive stress injuries of the soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="46XuC0"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1DFTkk"&gt;To the more than 88,617,915 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBcryY"&gt;To the families and friends of the 1,907,608 people who have died worldwide — 367,635 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkEDsS"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A few deals to get 2021 started off right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0WqZOZe3PbX16UNCFwNFeW4o9k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68642604/akrales_191008_3706_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1sVPDW"&gt;After a brief hiatus over the holiday, we’re back with another Verge Deals dispatch. Since we last sent one of these out, many of the deals that filled our daily coverage around the holidays have come to an end, and recently, whenever a good sale comes around, it usually doesn’t last too long. Simply put, the dealscape is a little barren right now. Nevertheless, I’ve put in some of the week’s best offers for your perusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yUDgsn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H5AZAT"&gt;Save on Nintendo’s fantastic &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v8xiQt"&gt;If you’re one of those people who makes a New Year’s resolution to get fit, there are a few deals you might want to know about. If you own a Nintendo Switch, consider picking up &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a game that requires the use of a Pilates ring to help you work out. The game itself has standalone workouts, or you can hop into a full campaign where the activities will scale up in difficulty. It’s fun! Normally $80, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728851577196507064" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $70 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Given that it was almost impossible to find earlier in the pandemic, it’s cool to see that not only is it in stock, but it’s cheaper, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8IcAWV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lnyl0k"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yntBZt"&gt;Get a 75-inch Hisense 4K TV for $300 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cgZ4ZS"&gt;In time for the Super Bowl, Best Buy has been dropping prices lately on large 4K HDR TVs from Hisense. Its 85-inch model was a popular deal with readers this past week, and while that particular model is no longer discounted, the 75-inch model is. Normally $1,000 even, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728939351250604130" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for $700&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JpSJ3x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="noncpP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xfKlEt"&gt;This is the last week to save 20 percent on six months of HBO Max&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_zpAF3ROEkQleTH1Zz_YYORcEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015310/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="33tgfd"&gt;January 15th is the last day to take advantage of a great deal on HBO Max. You can get 20 percent off the total cost of a six-month membership, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=verge"&gt;bringing the cost down to $70 instead of $90&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this deal requires paying in full for the half-year of service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0aOIR"&gt;I’m highlighting this again because, in case you missed it, Warner Bros. is bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;all of its 2021 films will be released on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, for 30 days, at the same time that they’re released in theaters. So far, you can watch &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; in glorious 4K, but many more will be released throughout the year, like Denis Villeneuve’s take on &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="q8h7Fm"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LQqho2"&gt;OnePlus’ Nord N10 5G includes a free set of wireless earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2pj0G5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G just launched. It’s a confusing name for a phone with a very simple goal: bringing 5G to the masses in a $300 phone that has a 90Hz refresh rate display. To find out more and see some camera samples, read my colleague Allison Johnson’s great review on it. If you want to buy the phone, doing so will get you a complimentary set of OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa’s ‘Tell Me When’ skill combines reminders with contextual information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0CK3D3apVhw4g_aMd4DeNkgurQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68642572/cwelch_191016_3739_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5k3di3"&gt;Amazon has updated Alexa in the last month with a modified version of its popular reminders skill. You can now ask Alexa to “Tell me when” an event happens and your device will give you background information and notify you when it actually occurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mLXYF"&gt;You’ve been able to set a reminder for an event or task at a specific time for a while, and requesting Alexa to tell you when an event occurs can pull up relevant information. “Tell me when” is sort of a synthesis of the two tasks. Amazon provided a few examples: you could ask Alexa to “Tell me when the next Seahawks game is” and Alexa could tell you the time of the game and set a reminder to watch. Another interesting use is for email, you can now ask Alexa to tell you when an email arrives from a specific person, and Alexa can announce the email’s arrival to save you from constantly checking your inbox. Of course, you’d have to be comfortable giving Alexa access to your email for that feature to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPLJga"&gt;“Tell me when” shares some overlap with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21165985/new-alexa-features-nba-severe-weather-commute-directions"&gt;another earlier skill for severe weather alerts&lt;/a&gt;. You can ask Alexa to tell you when there’s a severe weather alert, and the assistant can remind you when there’s one in your area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub2IWJ"&gt;It’s may not be the most exciting feature on its face, but “Tell me when” is a good example of how Alexa has picked up the ability to provide more contextual information and follow-up questions over time. Amazon didn’t provide a full range of events that “tell me when” works for when we asked, but you should already be able to try out the skill.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is deleting Trump’s attempts to circumvent ban</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VHFcNG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter permanently banned Donald Trump today&lt;/a&gt;. For a brief moment, he managed to tweet anyhow — not from @realDonaldTrump, his suspended account, but rather the official @POTUS account reserved for the current President of the United States, one that will be handed over to Joe Biden on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kToazX"&gt;His message, before it was deleted, cryptically suggested that he will “have a big announcement soon” and that he was looking “at the possibilities of building out our own platform.”  Trump is currently deplatformed from most social media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wKwgHeAiHNenKo76izVwUY5HJnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223685/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_8.31.12_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdDfZX"&gt;As I have been saying for a long time, Twitter has gone further and further in banning free speech, and tonight, Twitter employees have coordinated with the Democrats and the Radical Left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me — and YOU, the 75,000,000 great...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcKXgd"&gt;...patriots who voted for me. Twitter may be a private company, but without the government’s gift of Section 230 they would not exist for long. I predicted this would happen. We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPO01w"&gt;...also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED! Twitter is not about FREE SPEECH. They are all about promoting a Radical Left platform where some of the most vicious people in the world are allowed to speak freely...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KGDLvx"&gt;Twitter told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier Friday that Trump would not be able to evade a ban by tweeting from a different account, and that his tweets might be deleted if he tweeted from a government account (like @POTUS). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mat/status/1347722670352158722?s=21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed with Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that is exactly what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoG6uP"&gt;If Trump tries to use a non-government account (say, if he created a new account), it would be permanently suspended “at first detection” according to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="davQJ0"&gt;Later on Friday evening, Trump tested that policy by tweeting the same messages from @TeamTrump, the Trump campaign’s official account. The messages remained active for a few minutes before the account was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3-wp_eyoitewLmupT27aGxQHMSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223744/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_6.30.54_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ALjhlL"&gt;The account also posted this picture shortly before it was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Opc_S2B3rMf95pXD_ZL_7Led5yc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223746/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJmFDa"&gt;Twitter confirmed that it permanently suspended @TeamTrump in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXvpVk"&gt;Gary Coby, listed on LinkedIn as the digital director for Trump’s 2020 campaign, has also had his account suspended after &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anthony/status/1347742612657217536?s=21"&gt;apparently offering it&lt;/a&gt; to White House social media director Dan Scavino for him to use and changing the display name and avatar to Trump’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TnFPh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This was Coby’s last update &lt;a href="https://t.co/IyqFmRo7gQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IyqFmRo7gQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anthony DeRosa   (@Anthony) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Anthony/status/1347742612657217536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGkZGx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th, 10:29PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added Gary Coby’s suspension.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pulls Parler from Play Store for fostering calls to violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgUTQz4YR_CqM727-nvBeR017rI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641548/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hWoAss"&gt;Google has suspended Parler from the Play Store, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrgold/status/1347704721281314823"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ashley Gold&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve confirmed the app is no longer on the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yw0zxX"&gt;Here is the full statement, which was shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6iXjJs"&gt;In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TvZxRE"&gt;Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYoNi9"&gt;Apple has given an ultimatum to Parler to police its app or be removed sometime on Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler?bftwnews&amp;amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;. The app is still available on Apple’s App Store. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bX5bVR"&gt;Both Google and Apple have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;come under pressure&lt;/a&gt; to remove the app, which is known for having less moderation and as a conservative-friendly alternative to other social media platforms. The pressure comes two days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, incited by President Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tbjw23"&gt;Twitter permanently suspended Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;, while Facebook placed an “indefinite” ban on Trump’s account &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLDWgw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th, 8:08PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxeUY9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: We originally said that &lt;/em&gt;Politico&lt;em&gt; reporter Cristiano Lima and &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; reporter Jack Nicas were first to report that Google removed Parler, but &lt;/em&gt;Axios &lt;em&gt;reporter&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ashley Gold tweeted the news before they did. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord bans pro-Trump server ‘The Donald’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbUCivEbkGwjuIWBHBhF1Awhneo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641509/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHrqvT"&gt;Discord has banned a server called “The Donald,” a pro-Trump community linked to banned subreddit r/The_Donald and TheDonald.win. The news was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1347690173748834309"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; writer (and &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;contributor) Casey Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTpubm"&gt;The ban comes two days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol,&lt;/a&gt; encouraged by President Trump, though Discord says that it has no evidence that the server was used to organize the riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qW3lIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In STILL OTHER news, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Discord&lt;/a&gt; says it has banned server The Donald, which was connected to TheDonald dot Win and the Donald subreddit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Made decision "due to its overt connection to an online forum used to incite violence and plan an armed insurrection,” spox says.&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1347690173748834309?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qInvow"&gt;“We have a zero-tolerance policy against hate and violence of any kind on the platform, or the use of Discord to support or organize around violent extremism,” Discord said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “While there is no evidence of a server called The Donald being used to organize the Jan 6 riots, Discord decided to ban the entire server today due to its overt connection to an online forum used to incite violence, plan an armed insurrection in the United States, and spread harmful misinformation related to 2020 U.S. election fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJmOip"&gt;Reddit banned pro-Trump subreddit r/The_Donald &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21304947/reddit-ban-subreddits-the-donald-chapo-trap-house-new-content-policy-rules"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; following an expansion of its policies to ban hate speech more explicitly. The Donald’s Discord server was one of the places former r/The_Donald members congregated following the ban, as detailed in this &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; article &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/the_donald_reddit_discord/"&gt;from October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzVKpO"&gt;Reddit also banned unofficial pro-Trump subreddit r/donaldtrump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220834/reddit-trump-subreddit-ban-violence-us-capitol-mob"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt; “given repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the US Capitol.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter permanently bans Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Donald J. Trump..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UtfFFpp7jfX6inoUrkzkGj_tSM=/0x0:5505x3670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68641193/1223057457.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9BWTi"&gt;Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump on Friday, days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol leaving five dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uXIs8"&gt;“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in a statement Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="au8oLY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After close review of recent Tweets from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.&lt;a href="https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y"&gt;https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkSCC2"&gt;The ban comes after the president incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building, disrupting Congress’ certification of Joe Biden as the President Elect. Twitter initially put a 12-hour ban on Trump’s account for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy” after he posted messages repeating lies that the election was stolen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygTtKY"&gt;At the time, Twitter said Trump would be banned permanently if he continued to violate its rules, including those around civic integrity or violent threats. Twitter said in a statement Friday that two new tweets posted since Trump’s initial suspension violated the platform’s rules, prompting the permanent suspension. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAzEDjOtMBq8lFfqzrh2uLiV0Mo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223529/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_3.22.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter permanently suspending President Donald Trump’s Twitter account Friday evening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OBmP9k"&gt;“Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html"&gt;in its Friday blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYjq67"&gt;Twitter decided the new tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” at the Capitol, and shared its reasoning in five parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHV0r"&gt;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103016311259136"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A91mvh"&gt;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtqrZ8"&gt;The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXDAjH"&gt;The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VbraO"&gt;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jFrZa1"&gt;Twitter declined to comment on other Trump-related accounts like @POTUS when questioned by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If Trump attempted to circumvent this ban by using a separate account, that account would be permanently suspended “at first detection,” according to Twitter. If a government account, like @POTUS, was used to evade @realDonaldTrump’s ban, Twitter said that it would try to limit the account’s use but would not suspend it unless it was necessary to curb real-world violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffehIo"&gt;Earlier Friday, more than 300 Twitter employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221386/twitter-employees-trump-ban-internal-letter-capitol-attack"&gt;signed onto an internal petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for Trump to be permanently banned following the January 6th Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVBVy8"&gt;“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” the employees wrote in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltCwtD"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put an “indefinite” ban on Trump&lt;/a&gt; that it said would last at least through Inauguration Day. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks “are simply too great” to allow Trump continued access after he used the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwGgn6"&gt;The suspension has been a long time coming. For years, Twitter has faced pressure to remove Trump from its platform due to the large megaphone it’s offered him to spread hateful language and lies. The company justified his continued presence on the platform as being in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxq2GB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/8/20 at 7:22PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included new context on ban circumvention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poBSC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/8/20 at 7:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included additional context from Twitter on ban evasions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google face pressure to deplatform Parler over calls to violence</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WDGyqC"&gt;Apple and Google are facing new pressure to deplatform Parler, a social network founded as a less moderated and more conservative-friendly alternative to Facebook and Twitter. Late Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler?bftwnews&amp;amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has given Parler 24 hours to put a moderation platform into place or be expelled from its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAey1R"&gt;Apple wrote to Parler executives Friday telling them it had received complaints about “objectionable content,” according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;, “accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries, and the destruction of property. The app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities.” If Parler doesn’t comply, the app will be removed from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stWIeW"&gt;Activist group Sleeping Giants had called on both Apple and Google to ban Parler from their app stores in response to posts calling for violence against elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBxgR6"&gt;As evidence, the group posted screenshots of Parler posts calling for Vice President Mike Pence to face a firing squad and encouraging “American Patriots” to return to the capital on January 19th “carrying Our weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NSgQ3X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, we asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GooglePlay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GooglePlay&lt;/a&gt; to enforce their own Terms of Service on Parler based on the sheer number of violent threats on the platform with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PullParler?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PullParler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at the VERY CLEAR terms set by these two app stores below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4"&gt;https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1347522919992336387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiVyHk"&gt;The group points out that both Google and Apple have clear rules against violent threats and moderation of content. Apple’s App Store says apps must have “a method for filtering objectionable material from being posted” and “a mechanism to report offensive content.” Google’s Play Store bars apps that “depict or facilitate gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities,” and that “we don’t allow apps that contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or bullying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfmlvL"&gt;Neither Apple nor Google replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Parler also did not reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNiOPG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;Parler saw its numbers skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; after Twitter and Facebook tightened their moderation, with conservative protesters finding a home among like-minded users. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-john-matze.html?"&gt;Thursday interview with Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Parler CEO John Matze said any posts on the site indicating Wednesday’s riots were “illegally organized and against the law” would have been removed. “But I don’t feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we’re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpnbBG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained particular momentum among Parler users, as well as other conspiracy theories around the election that had been debunked elsewhere. In the wake of the Capitol raid, researchers have circulated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;dozens of posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the attack on the Capitol. “Chloroform. Silencers. SHARP knives &amp;amp; keep walking,” reads one, “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” reads another, to which someone replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;On Thursday evening, the site had posts from Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1347570822437863424"&gt;questioning whether his concession speech&lt;/a&gt; was a deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmpzSI"&gt;There is some precedent for removing an app for hosting violent content. After a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned the social network Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic rants on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple had rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google removed the app from the Google Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VayTgj"&gt;Since Apple and Google control the biggest smartphone operating systems, the companies wield immense power over mobile app distribution. The inability to push its app on the two biggest app stores greatly reduced Gab’s reach, forcing users to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;workarounds to use it&lt;/a&gt; on mobile sites. Gab’s desktop site, however, appears alive and well, with a new post from President Trump extolling the “great American Patriots who voted for me” leading the site’s “hot” posts on Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcmjee"&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook have implemented temporary bans on President Trump’s accounts, treating recent statements as likely to provoke violence. The platforms had previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;adopted strict policies against election and voting misinformation&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2N9IJ"&gt;In a post on Parler Thursday, &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/23a2c1d63ea94c74b04d03917ad03339"&gt;Matze criticized Facebook and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for their actions against the president’s posts. “It’s clear that Facebook and Twitter believe the ends justify the means. They believe the American people are weak. They insult our founding fathers by suggesting Zuckerburg [sic] and Dorsey know what is best for us,” he wrote. “Parler is not an arbiter of truth. We believe in you. We believe you are wise enough to decide for yourself and trust that given access to all information we can self govern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lhu6uU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th 6:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added report that Apple gave Parler 24 hours to add moderation or be expelled from the App Store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are Sony’s first 360-degree audio speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gc4a7zTG6NNmscqzyA93l2vNWJg=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640844/jxdfau1hhb1wznu95f1c.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6Xhju"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220223/sony-360-degree-audio-video-speakers-software"&gt;Sony announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be releasing two new speakers compatible with 360 Reality Audio, its spatial audio technology that replicates the feel of live music by placing different sounds and vocals in a virtual sphere around you. It said its plan is to release them this spring, but it didn’t share what the speakers would look like. We didn’t have to wait to learn more about them, though, as Sony’s UK website now has full product pages for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/wireless-speakers/srs-ra5000"&gt;SRS-RA5000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/wireless-speakers/srs-ra3000"&gt;SRS-RA3000&lt;/a&gt; speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50EA4J"&gt;The higher-end SRS-RA5000, pictured at the top of this post, will have three up-firing speakers, three side speakers, and a woofer. It’s also certified for High-Resolution Audio. The SRS-RA3000, pictured below, has two tweeters, two passive radiators, and a full-range driver. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCdfVqh8RVZ_DdvHVORKjDUu9Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223041/imydsjfdmwz4rleeuiah.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s SRS-RA3000 speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwHxvM"&gt;Both speakers can calibrate themselves to the room they’re in with an internal microphone and a “unique Sony algorithm,” too. With the SRS-RA5000, you have to press and hold a button on the speaker, while the SRS-RA3000 can calibrate itself automatically. The two speakers also have Sony’s Auto Volume feature, which adjusts the volume of each track automatically to play them at a consistent volume. And both speakers support Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B55Fyr"&gt;The SRS-RA5000 will cost approximately £500 / €599, while the SRS-RA3000 is priced at about £280 / €359, according to the &lt;a href="https://presscentre.sony.co.uk/pressreleases/change-the-way-you-listen-to-music-at-home-with-sonys-new-srs-ra5000-and-srs-ra3000-wireless-home-speakers-3063448"&gt;press release on Sony’s UK website&lt;/a&gt;. That also says both speakers will arrive in February 2021, which is a bit sooner than the previous “spring” date we had heard before, so perhaps there will be different release dates in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egt1vM"&gt;Sony said it is expanding the 360 Reality Audio platform from audio to video &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/202101/21-001E/"&gt;earlier on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is working with major music labels and service providers to begin streaming video content with the codec later this year. Approximately 4,000 songs currently support the format, according to Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
