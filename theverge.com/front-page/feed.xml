    <title>Respawn stops selling the original Titanfall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="titanfall-560-art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZL7OHIIXKM1ikg0jFG6LwYen7sA=/0x11:560x384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215880/titanfall-560.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HngWCC"&gt;Respawn Entertainment has decided to end sales of the original &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o8YFIW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A note about Titanfall. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ew232HkUIo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ew232HkUIo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1466097260836519938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1HkB2z"&gt;Starting today, players will no longer be able to purchase &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and the game will be removed from subscription services like Xbox Game Pass on March 1st, 2022. Though &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; is no longer purchasable, players who already own the game will still be able to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3O8w6"&gt;“We will, however, be keeping servers live for the dedicated fanbase still playing,” Respawn wrote. It is not known how long Respawn intends to keep those servers around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RMd24EbJvhzdeWo22feHaaHznf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056075/steam_titanfall.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Titanfall is no long available on Steam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B8VWlZ"&gt;The announcement goes on to say that the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; universe is “core to Respawn’s DNA” perhaps to reassure players that the studio will continue to support the series. Earlier this year, both &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; games were subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22563257/save-titanfall-hackers-apex-legends-ea-respawn"&gt;numerous game-disrupting hacks and DDOS attacks&lt;/a&gt; with players accusing Respawn Entertainment and publisher EA of ignoring &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;’s problems in favor of the more popular and more lucrative &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3T5So"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting some much-needed taskbar and Start menu improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMCv170wsj9b-dzSD384ylGQwpA=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215630/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VNLDn6"&gt;Windows 11’s taskbar is a giant step back in usability compared to Windows 10, and now Microsoft is starting to make improvements. A new update that’s currently being tested by Windows Insiders brings the clock and date back to the taskbar on secondary or multiple monitors. It’s a change that multiple monitor users will appreciate, as many have had to install third-party apps like ElevenClock just to get this basic functionality in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmHx3k"&gt;I’ve not been shy about criticizing the changes made to the taskbar in Windows 11. I hate the new taskbar, so I’m happy to see Microsoft make this initial change. There’s still much more to be improved, and hopefully we see the return of being able to drag and drop files onto taskbar apps and the general customization options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WYle5oMIX54zG8jpTOKAw-hnvtw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055934/Start_Resize.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjckhh"&gt;Elsewhere, Microsoft is also making some improvements to the Start menu in Windows 11. The latest 22509 Insider build includes the ability to configure the Start menu to show more pins or more recommendations instead. That makes the Start menu a little more customizable, although many Windows 11 users are also opting for third-party apps here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXmp71"&gt;This latest Windows 11 build also includes more improvements to the Settings app as part of Microsoft’s ongoing effort to include more Control Panel settings in the main Settings app. “We have moved the advanced sharing settings (such as Network discovery, File and printer sharing, and public folder sharing) to a new page in Settings app under Advanced Network Settings,” explains Amanda Langowski, head of Microsoft’s Windows Insider program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="99BaUB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I hate the new Windows 11 taskbar","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673266/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-features-missing-design-changes"},{"title":"These apps let you customize Windows 11 to bring the taskbar back to life ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722202/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-customize-apps-start11-elevenclock"},{"title":"How to customize your Windows 11 taskbar ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22688307/windows-11-microsoft-taskbar-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LKPcd9"&gt;There are also improvements to the pages in the Printers &amp;amp; Scanners section, and some parts of the Control Panel will now redirect Windows 11 users to the main Settings app instead. It feels like Microsoft is moving ever closer to finally removing the Control Panel in favor of its modern Settings app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HLt2s"&gt;All of these features won’t be available for some months yet, though. These are part of the Dev Channel round of updates to Windows 11, and some may debut as cumulative updates in the monthly changes Microsoft makes to the OS. Others may be included in the larger annual update that Microsoft is planning for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok rolls out Creator Next and expands money-making opportunities for creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JsiCbz5CgHXtHa6ujqYERlK8xE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215618/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k1Ny4W"&gt;TikTok has announced that it’s rolling out Creator Next, a single hub for all of the platform's monetization tools, and it also outlined some updates for its existing creator tools (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/tiktok-adds-creator-monetization-features-including-tips-and-video-gifts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-next"&gt;post on TikTok’s newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, the short-form video platform explains that alongside Creator Next, it’s also widely introducing its tipping feature, which lets users send money directly to their favorite creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXyG8z"&gt;This is part of TikTok’s larger efforts to retain creators and prevent them from hopping on other networks that pay creators, like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat. When the platform was just a year old in 2019, users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335404/tiktok-creators-monetization-fund-followers-youtube-content-videos"&gt;struggled to find ways to earn money natively through the app&lt;/a&gt;, as they had to secure deals and sponsorships outside of the app. To help remedy this, the platform later rolled out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362060/tiktok-creators-fund-recipients-david-dobrik-brittany-tomlinson-youtube-adsense"&gt;$200 million Creator Fund in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, splitting up the cash to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362060/tiktok-creators-fund-recipients-david-dobrik-brittany-tomlinson-youtube-adsense"&gt;reward the platform’s most popular creators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPQDr9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751715/tiktok-new-tips-feature-creators"&gt;TikTok started testing Tips&lt;/a&gt; as another way for creators to make money this October, but now it appears that the feature is available to all creators who meet TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/tips/"&gt;eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt;. The qualifications include being over the age of 18, having an account in good standing, and having 100,000 followers or more. TikTok notes that creators will receive 100 percent of every tip, and that they’ll be processed through payment service Stripe, with tippers incurring a small fee. As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; points out, going through Stripe ensures that TikTok won’t have to pay Apple’s required 30 percent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;commission for in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V9mUJ3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creators now need 10,000 followers to access the Creator Marketplace&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xJqIZ"&gt;In its post, the platform also noted that it’s expanding on its Live Gifts feature, which lets viewers gift diamonds — a virtual currency that’s redeemable for cash — during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596718/tiktok-live-video-streaming-events-scheduling-co-host-picture-in-picture"&gt;livestreams&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok is now throwing Video Gifts into the mix, allowing users to donate diamonds during regular, non-live videos. Just like with Tips, creators must have 100,000 followers or more (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/video-gifts/"&gt;among a few other things&lt;/a&gt;) to qualify. This is quite the change from Live Gifts, which only require creators to have 1,000 followers or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JUy1z6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find and create live videos on TikTok ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22576007/tiktok-how-to-live-find-go-gifts-diamonds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lpbg8e"&gt;Additionally, TikTok is giving more creators access to its &lt;a href="https://creatormarketplace.tiktok.com/"&gt;Creator Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, a portal where creators can find and collaborate with business partners to earn money through sponsored videos. Creators now need 10,000 followers to access the Marketplace, as opposed to the &lt;a href="https://armfulmedia.com/tiktok-creator-marketplace/"&gt;previous 100,000 follower requirement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl5wbj"&gt;All of these tools, including the Creator Fund, Creator Marketplace, Live Gifts, Video Gifts, and Tips, will appear within the Creator Next portal. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creator-next/"&gt;TikTok notes&lt;/a&gt; that creators must “meet minimum follower requirements,” which can vary depending on region, as well as 1,000 video views within the past 30 days to use Creator Next. The feature is also only available in the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, with support for Canada and Australia arriving in the “coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox is letting more people test the very latest console features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eGWIOPn7r14tFHH-i6xde4xlz0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215551/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtOF8e"&gt;Microsoft is opening up its invite-only Xbox testing rings for more console testers to get access to the very latest features. Xbox testing includes many levels, and the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead rings typically include the bleeding edge of Xbox dashboard features that may not debut publicly for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IoqsK"&gt;Microsoft keeps these Alpha rings invite-only, reserved for those who regularly provide feedback through other Xbox testing rings. Now, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/30/are-you-interested-in-joining-the-alpha-or-alpha-skip-ahead-rings/"&gt;Microsoft is inviting Xbox testers&lt;/a&gt; to complete a survey to be considered for the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead rings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Tfo8X"&gt;“You will receive a notice on your console if you are selected to participate,” says Austin Olney, an Xbox program manager. “There are limited spots available, so completing the survey does not guarantee an invitation. You also might be selected for a different ring than what you indicated in the survey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDG18A"&gt;The survey is available in the Xbox Insider Hub app, and Microsoft says it doesn’t matter what ring you’re in for testing right now or how long you’ve been a part of its Xbox Insider program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbpxUq"&gt;Microsoft has been testing a bunch of new Xbox dashboard features with Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead testers over the past 12 months, including the early release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318050/microsoft-edge-xbox-chromium-browser-testing"&gt;Edge Chromium browser&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in trying out the very latest features, then Skip-Ahead has the most updates, but be warned there are occasional bugs that often sneak into these builds that can affect games or apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Renewables see record growth in 2021, but supply chain problems loom </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Solar and Wind Farms in Qinghai Province as China Expands Clean Energy Access" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IcqChoxXGr6GYCS9h8DZ9fERQB8=/430x0:5035x3070/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215386/1235228776.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photovoltaic modules at a solar power plant near Golmud, Qinghai province, China, on Saturday, Sept. 11, 2021. | Qilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rwOgJM"&gt;2021 is on course to break a global record for renewable energy growth, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2021"&gt;Renewables Market Report.&lt;/a&gt; That’s despite skyrocketing commodity prices, which could bog down the transition to clean energy in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykcPoC"&gt;With 290 GW in additional capacity expected to be commissioned by the end of the year, 2021 will smash the record for renewable electricity growth that was just set last year. This year’s additions even outpace a forecast that the International Energy Agency (IEA) made in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Att8pA"&gt;“Exceptionally high growth” would be the “new normal” for renewable sources of electricity, the IEA &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-2021"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. Solar energy, in particular, was on track to take the crown as the “new king of electricity,” the IEA said in its October 2020 &lt;a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a72d8abf-de08-4385-8711-b8a062d6124a/WEO2020.pdf"&gt;World Energy Outlook report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nN9EtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Solar continued to dominate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qbJVI4"&gt;Solar continued to dominate in 2021, with an expected record growth of nearly 160 GW. It made up more than half of all the renewable energy capacity added this year, a trend that the IEA thinks will continue over the next five. Renewables will likely make up 95 percent of new power capacity globally through 2026, according to the new report. The IEA also predicts explosive growth for offshore wind capacity, which could more than triple over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMiAj"&gt;By 2026, the IEA says, the amount of renewable electricity capacity globally will likely be equivalent to today’s fossil fuel and nuclear energy capacity combined. That’s a huge shift. In 2020, renewable energy only made up &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021/renewables"&gt;29 percent&lt;/a&gt; of electricity generation globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpF05L"&gt;Still, there are some dark clouds in the IEA’s new forecast for renewables. Soaring prices for commodities, shipping, and energy all threaten the previously rosy outlook for renewable energy. The cost of polysilicon used to make solar panels has more than quadrupled since the start of 2020, according to the IEA. Investment costs for utility-scale onshore wind and solar farms have risen 25 percent compared to 2019. That could delay the completion of new renewable energy projects that have already been contracted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xs0ajU"&gt;More than half of the new utility-scale solar projects already planned for 2022 could face delays or cancellation because of larger price tags for materials and shipping, according to a separate &lt;a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/most-of-2022s-solar-PV-projects-risk-delay-or-cancelation-due-to-soaring-material-and-shipping-costs/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Rystad Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAFV6k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The transition to renewable energy needs to speed up significantly to meet the scale of the climate crisis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3c8ytx"&gt;If commodity prices stay high over the next year, it could erase three to five years of gains&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;solar and wind have made, respectively, when it comes to affordability. A dramatic price drop for photovoltaic modules over the past few decades has fueled solar’s success. &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/evolution-of-solar-pv-module-cost-by-data-source-1970-2020"&gt;Costs fell&lt;/a&gt; from $30 per watt in 1980 to $0.20 per watt for solar energy in 2020. By last year, solar was already the &lt;a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a72d8abf-de08-4385-8711-b8a062d6124a/WEO2020.pdf"&gt;cheapest source of electricity&lt;/a&gt; in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIJZKi"&gt;Renewables haven’t fallen too far behind, however, because costs are rising for all forms of energy. “The high commodity and energy prices we are seeing today pose new challenges for the renewable industry, but elevated fossil fuel prices also make renewables even more competitive,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/renewable-electricity-growth-is-accelerating-faster-than-ever-worldwide-supporting-the-emergence-of-the-new-global-energy-economy"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFyf6P"&gt;Still, the transition to renewable energy needs to speed up significantly to meet the scale of the climate crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels need to virtually disappear by the middle of the century to avoid catastrophic climate change, according to a huge body of &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. To make that happen, new renewable power capacity needs to grow at nearly twice the rate the IEA foresees over the next five years, the agency says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify Wrapped 2021 is here to take over your social media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spotify Wrapped 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KswJpE7orzWXqd1hpuu52f7VTY0=/0x131:1216x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215366/PR_2021_Minutes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify Wrapped 2021 | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1KAT4"&gt;Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/the-wait-is-over-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-is-here/"&gt;has released its eagerly anticipated&lt;/a&gt; Wrapped experience revealing the most listened to artists and albums for (most of) 2021. This year, it’s adding even more social media-friendly features that help you share your favorite music with a customized movie, aura, or playing cards. Naturally, you can share Spotify’s auto-created images on your timeline and, for the first time, directly to TikTok. It’s sure to spark discussions with friends and provide valuable marketing for Spotify that competitors like Apple and YouTube can’t seem to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUsBKX"&gt;Here’s how to find your Spotify 2021 Wrapped experience. To get all of the interactive features, you’ll need to open the Spotify mobile app — it’s not available on the desktop or web version. If you’re on an iPhone or Android device, just &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/"&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; and it should open the correct page inside the app. If you’re not seeing it yet, try refreshing the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jltz5g"&gt;If you don’t have Spotify or aren’t seeing it yet, these are some of the new features it’s added in 2021 to promote sharing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLOJRP"&gt;The Movie feature gives you selected songs for your biopic formatted for your opening credits theme, the moment of reflection, the dance-off, or the big game. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three phones showing Spotify Wrapped’s new feature 2021 the movie" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQdoibudIa5PFHmDxDtlxudgBJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055547/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_9.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s new 2021: The Movie feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zN4Hxg"&gt;Spotify users can also get a visualization of their audio aura based on their top two music moods. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three phones showing Spotify Wrapped’s new feature audio aura" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clHxQVlyD--Vhxxz3Sa3g8ho1tY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055536/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_9.44.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s new audio aura feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yifiwY"&gt;Spotify also released a data-based game that you can play and share with your friends called  Playing Cards. In the style of two truths and a lie, players can look at statements about another user’s listening history and guess which one is a lie. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three phones showing Spotify Wrapped’s new feature playing cards" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GIpeq6msDmeYiI-0cqU3PGSgZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055538/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_9.44.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s new Playing Cards feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qKYhzT"&gt;Spotify is also using Wrapped to expand the blend feature that was released this year by letting users blend their Spotify Wrapped and share the results on social media. Also available is Spotify’s 2021 Wrapped hub, which includes both personalized and editorially curated content and playlists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcsNUw"&gt;Other than TikTok, Wrapped cards are directly shareable to Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUWieq"&gt;So what about people who don’t use Spotify? Apple Music users like me can’t enjoy Spotify Wrapped, but we have access to &lt;a href="https://music.apple.com/replay"&gt;Apple Music Replay&lt;/a&gt; which includes a compilation of a user’s most played songs and lists most listened to artists and albums, plus an option to listen to playlists dating back to 2015. Of course, if you’re seeking your own unique version of today’s Wrapped interactive experience, then 2021 is just another year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997218/spotify-wrapped-year-end-decade-review-apple-music-streaming-audio-service"&gt;reminding you of what you’re missing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB3MSI"&gt;Other music streaming services like YouTube Music and Tidal have released their own versions to commemorate a user’s listening history. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/30/youtube-music-2021-recap/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that some YouTube Music subscribers &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/30/youtube-music-2021-recap/"&gt;have spotted a 2021 Recap&lt;/a&gt; that includes playlists and stats. Tidal &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidal-releases-my-2020-rewind-for-members-to-look-back-at-their-year-in-music-301182905.html"&gt;released its My 2020 Rewind&lt;/a&gt; feature last year on December 1st but has yet to release an updated 2021 version. As far as other streaming services, they might be waiting until the end of December to take a look back on the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google announces grab bag of new Android features for the end of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6BEbICX3NxjzrHkzkVfR1s_xC7k=/118x0:1398x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215130/Untitled__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fijamA"&gt;Google has a bevy of new features coming soon to Android, including new widgets for YouTube Music, Google Play Books, and Google Photos; new Android Auto features; and updates for Google Assistant and Google Photos. The company detailed the new features &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-december-2021/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="To5aJQ"&gt;The biggest car-based addition is that from today Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S21 owners will be able to use their phones as a car key with “compatible BMW vehicles” in select countries. Google announced it was working on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22436410/google-android-auto-os-pixel-phone-key-io"&gt;car key feature for Android 12 in May&lt;/a&gt;, specifically citing BMW as one of the manufacturers with which it would work. Google says the feature will be available “on all BMW 2020 &amp;amp; 2022 model year vehicles,” and that it hopes to add more compatible vehicles in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOhnTM"&gt;Other new Android Auto features that are coming soon include an option to have the car-friendly interface automatically launch when an Android phone is connected to the vehicle, a new play button on the homescreen to start music playback with a “single tap,” a new search icon to quickly find music, and new smart reply options for text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3mc6gD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hp-lGxwPUnI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mGZMUU"&gt;New widgets are also coming to the Android phone screen for the YouTube Music, Google Play Books, and Google Photos apps. The music widget offers playback controls and access to recently played tracks, while the books widget gives shortcuts to your library. There’s also a new Google Photos widget rolling out next week that can be set to specifically show pictures of select people and pets from your library. As well as a new widget, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20860938/google-photos-memories-prints-cvs-walmart-canvas"&gt;Google Photos’ Memories feature&lt;/a&gt; will also start showing curated photos and videos of events like New Years Eve within the standard photo grid interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1JHuV"&gt;Google’s “Family Bell” feature, its alarm-like reminder system that can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353207/google-assistant-smart-display-speakers-family-new-features-homeschool"&gt;broadcast from smart speakers and displays&lt;/a&gt;, is also being updated to work on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PqesWX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CiQEfiZv9s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JquKdK"&gt;Finally, Google has also provided an update on the rollout of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679379/android-11-auto-reset-permissions-android-6"&gt;permissions-reset feature on older Android phones&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically turns off permissions for apps you haven’t used in a while. The feature is already available for devices running Android 11 and above but will now expand to devices running Android 6 and up “starting next month,” the company says, indicating a January rollout. It previously said the expansion would begin rolling out in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxWC3A"&gt;As is typical with these kinds of feature drops from Google, these new options are releasing in a variety of different timeframes, ranging from “today” for the BMW car key feature to the “coming months” for the Android Auto voice search and smart replies features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors announces it will build a new cathode plant in North America </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Visits General Motors’ Factory Zero Electric Vehicle Factory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHX-FwaeOomro4dr_EX80GCEynU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215016/1236631423.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eWzdSt"&gt;General Motors announced that it will construct a new cathode factory in North America for its electric vehicle batteries. The factory, which will be built under a joint venture with South Korea’s Posco Chemical, will process cathode active material (CAM), which represents about 40 percent of the cost of an EV battery cell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CBNii"&gt;Much like the rest of the auto industry, GM is racing to boost its EV offerings, vowing to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025. To accomplish this enormous feat, the company is trying to get a stronger grasp on its supply chain, which includes battery manufacturing. The company has said it will spend over $4 billion on the construction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;two battery factories&lt;/a&gt; in North America in partnership with South Korea’s LG Chem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L76B7n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Much like the rest of the auto industry, GM is racing to boost its EV offerings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKb1TD"&gt;The new cathode facility will supply battery materials to the two factories that are currently under construction: the Ultium Cells facilities in Lordstown, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee. GM is also planning to build two more cell facilities by mid-decade, the company has said. GM did not disclose the location of the new cathode facility but said it would be open by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE7P6r"&gt;The majority of EV battery cathodes are made with NCM — nickel, cobalt, and magnesium. The Ultium batteries will add aluminum — so NCMA — and reduce the cobalt content by 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgbpcW"&gt;Cobalt is &lt;a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/bu_310_cobalt"&gt;a key component of batteries&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also the most expensive material in the battery and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/"&gt;mined under conditions that often violate human rights&lt;/a&gt;, leading it to be called the “blood diamond of batteries.” As a result, GM and other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451678/tesla-new-cathode-plant-north-america-battery-day"&gt;like Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, are rushing to create a cobalt-free battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6jbsv"&gt;“We would like to get out of cobalt altogether and have a zero cobalt situation,” said Doug Parks, GM’s executive vice president focused on global product development, purchasing and supply chain. “We’re going to start with old Ultium NCMA chemistry, and then we will we will advance as we go forward as quickly as possible to improve either the performance or the cost of the battery cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pcjta"&gt;This is the latest announcement from GM regarding its efforts to boost its EV production through vertical integration. The company also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22559718/gm-lithium-ctr-ev-battery-investment-salton-sea"&gt;struck a deal to source lithium&lt;/a&gt;, a key ingredient in electric-car batteries, from geothermal deposits in the US. And it’s building a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709389/gm-wallace-battery-center-ev-ultium-research"&gt;new 300,000-square-foot battery research facility&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan to help it realize its mission of building electric vehicle batteries that are longer-lasting, quicker to charge, and more sustainable for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Barnes &amp; Noble announces new Nook GlowLight 4, says it cares for real this time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HxyWTAGOKs4lK0uhXBA9TG-gHDQ=/166x0:1266x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70215009/nook.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MA5vv4"&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has once again remembered that it ostensibly wants to sell e-readers and has announced the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2Fnook-glowlight-4-barnes-noble%2F1140326110%3Fean%3D9780594149293&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811857%2Fbarnes-noble-nook-glowlight-4-e-reader-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nook GlowLight 4&lt;/a&gt;, a $149 e-reader that offers a refreshed design, more onboard storage, and USB-C charging to the company’s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNEnTl"&gt;The last dedicated Nook e-reader, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/1/16591594/nook-glowlight-3-ereader-eink-barnes-and-noble"&gt;the GlowLight 3&lt;/a&gt;, was announced 49 months ago (to the day) on November 1st, 2017, although Barnes &amp;amp; Noble did give the Nook brand a shot in the arm earlier this year with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340588/barnes-and-noble-new-nook-10-hd-tablet-lenovo-price-release-date-ebooks"&gt;new, Lenovo-made budget tablet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Uay09"&gt;The new GlowLight 4 doesn’t appear to move the needle much compared to the 2017 model, though. The display is an identical six-inch, 300ppi e-paper display with an integrated backlight and adjustable color temperature functionality, although the company has slimmed down the bezels and overall size of the new model. Battery life has been increased, with up to 50 days off a single charge (up from a month on the old model). And the onboard storage has been quadrupled from 8GB to 32GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QEtH4U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first new Nook e-reader in 49 months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QUGAs4"&gt;Those new upgrades also come with an unfortunate $30 price increase, with the Nook GlowLight 4 costing $149, up from the already expensive $119 that the GlowLight 3 went for. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble isn’t adding back more important features like waterproofing or more premium materials. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ulNr9kw-E73kv-wP_v-L40l7SbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055570/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_11.14.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nook GlowLight 3 (left) and the new GlowLight 4 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HWRDBy"&gt;It’s something that’s especially puzzling given that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble was one of the first companies to add both of those features with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9582252/barnes-and-noble-nook-glowlight-plus-waterproof-ereader"&gt;2015 GlowLight Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which offered a sleek aluminum design long before Amazon did with its Oasis. The Nook was also waterproof years before Amazon and Kobo would make that the standard across most of their product lineups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVO0DR"&gt;And given the $149 price tag, the GlowLight 4 is a pretty hard sell. It’s pricier than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books"&gt;Amazon’s new Paperwhite model&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $139 (when not on one of its frequent holiday sales) and has a bigger display, waterproofing, and a larger ebook storefront. And it matches up poorly against Kobo’s Libra line, too, which has a $159 starting price but adds a bigger and better display, waterproofing, and easier access to borrowed library books. The only real benefit that the GlowLight 4 offers is physical page turn buttons, making it the cheapest major e-reader to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IxeAK"&gt;That said, it seems like the GlowLight 4 might just be the tip of the Nook iceberg. “Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is now investing significantly in our Nook line of products,” Barnes &amp;amp; Noble CEO James Daunt promised in an accompanying press release, noting plans to “reinvigorate Nook in the coming months and years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUdETa"&gt;And while Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has a long way to go before it catches up to Kobo or Amazon, getting a third competitive player in the e-reader space would be a good thing — even if Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is only slightly less of a monolithic corporation than, say, Amazon or Rakuten (which owns Kobo). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WV1sI0"&gt;The Nook GlowLight 4 is set to go on sale on Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s website and in stores in one week on December 8th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hawkeye’s trick USB arrow is in desperate need of a dongle</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5JdlCD"&gt;In the third episode of &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld) does something very unexpected: she requests a USB dongle in the midst of a battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGiCIL"&gt;The highlight of the episode is a scene where Kate and her reluctant mentor, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), are fighting their way through the Tracksuit Mafia amidst some hectic New York City traffic. While Clint drives, Kate goes through his collection of trick arrows. Most are the kind of comic book goofiness you’d expect: one arrow creates a bubbling purple foam; another becomes destructively huge. Later, though, Clint hands Kate something much less useful in a fight: an arrow with a USB-A port on the end. “God, I hope he’s got a dongle to make this useful,” Kate quips afterward. (It turns out to not be very useful.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PCKgCv"&gt;This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a trick arrow designed to interface with computers. In the original &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; movie, Hawkeye had an arrow that could hack a very specific and proprietary port on a flying Helicarrier. But the new episode of the show makes it clear that there are much more mundane arrows as well. Unfortunately, given the surprising amount of characters who use a USB C-equipped Pixel phone in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye,&lt;/em&gt; the superhero is going to have to update his arsenal soon.&lt;/p&gt;
