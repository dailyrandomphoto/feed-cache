    <title>Deezer beats Spotify to Apple Watch offline listening</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrGhTedDc1eTCvGaW5IQAYsh4jg=/0x7:1240x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309895/1240x840_logo_3_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Deezer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BrWWhV"&gt;Music streaming service Deezer has revamped its Apple Watch app to let you listen to music without an internet connection, the &lt;a href="https://www.deezer-blog.com/press/apple-watch-app/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Previously Deezer’s Apple Watch app has only been able to &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OiX6symDxJMJ:https://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207989465-Apple-Watch+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;control music playback on a paired iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, but now paid subscribers can download songs for offline listening when they’re away from their phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZWBUf"&gt;Offline listening has previously been &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204691"&gt;available with Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/4/18169040/pandora-app-apple-watch-offline-playback-now-available"&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt;, but similar functionality is yet to appear in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18063838/spotify-apple-watch-download-features"&gt;Spotify’s Apple Watch app&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify recently added the ability to stream music from Apple Watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549483/spotify-apple-watch-streaming-music-rolling-out"&gt;without needing a paired iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature still requires a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. Meanwhile, Google just teased that Spotify users will soon be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;download tracks to Wear OS smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it even more strange that it doesn’t offer a similar feature on Apple’s wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iTSn1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be able to download Deezer playlists for offline listening&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig8How"&gt;Subscribers can download both Deezer playlists as well as their own personalized playlists for offline listening. Naturally, you’ll need enough storage on your Apple Watch to hold the files for offline listening. The streaming service doesn’t explicitly say which models of Apple Watch support the new feature, noting only that it requires the “latest Apple watch software.” Presumably this is referring to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fwatchos%2Fwatchos-7%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22443522%2Fdeezer-apple-watch-offline-listening" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;, which is available on Apple Watch devices going back to 2017’s Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9Lnab"&gt;The new Apple Watch feature follows Deezer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422637/apple-homepod-mini-deezer-third-party-music-integration"&gt;upgraded integration with Apple’s HomePod smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this month. The new functionality lets users control playback with Siri voice controls, and even make Deezer their default music service. Spotify is yet to offer the same option. Then again, with a &lt;a href="https://musically.com/2020/06/23/report-there-were-400m-music-subscribers-globally-at-end-of-q1-2020/"&gt;fraction of Spotify’s market share&lt;/a&gt;, Deezer has to work a lot harder to try and catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big IFA tech show is canceled again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IFA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L5WVFm1-VlPHjBwJw596hz9y69I=/0x166:3987x2824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309871/ifa_vladsavov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMQTLH"&gt;IFA 2021’s physical event &lt;a href="https://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/en/press/press-releases/news_4033.html"&gt;has been canceled&lt;/a&gt; just weeks after &lt;a href="https://b2b.ifa-berlin.com/en/press/press-releases/news_3328.html?referrer=/press/press-releases/#news-en-3328"&gt;promising it would return as an in-person show&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin in September. The event’s organizers cited “global health uncertainties” relating to the Covid-19 pandemic for the cancellation, including the emergence of new variants of the virus and concerns about the speed of vaccine rollouts around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3ZXBW"&gt;This will be the second year IFA has not taken place as normal in Berlin. Last year the show took place in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21230177/ifa-2020-coronavirus-berlin-germany-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;mostly-virtual format&lt;/a&gt;, with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333840/samsung-life-unstoppable-september-virtual-event"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2020/09/ifa-2020-lg-virtual-exhibition/"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; making announcements online coinciding with the dates the show would have normally taken place. IFA is the largest consumer tech show of its kind held in Europe each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FTPdnH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There simply are now too many uncertainties”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3zD5CA"&gt;“Unfortunately, the latest public health developments introduced too much risk into everybody’s planning for the event,” said Kai Hillebrandt, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of gfu Consumer &amp;amp; Home Electronics GmbH. “There simply are now too many uncertainties. Therefore, right now it has become near impossible for anyone to responsibly plan their participation in any trade show.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMFfog"&gt;These uncertainties are yet to force the cancellation of Europe’s other major tech show, MWC, which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;due to take place next month&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple companies including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;Samsung, Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nokia-joins-ericsson-in-bailing-on-mwc-with-oracle-sony-also-reportedly-out-/d/d-id/767983"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/ericsson-bails-mwc-barcelona-2021"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwc-june-2021-barcelona-in-person-sony-nokia-ericsson-oracle-220004011.html"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.telecomtv.com/content/sustainability/what-s-up-with-oracle-mwc-orange-ofcom-5g-spectrum-apple-41023/"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; have said they won’t be attending the conference in-person.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google wants to build a useful quantum computer by 2029</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxi-5MRIWC2nUOJ0OBQbKcW6gOs=/1x0:640x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309618/ezgif.com_gif_maker__11_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Google’s cryostats, which keeps a quantum computer cold enough to reduce errors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ky7RLo"&gt;Google is aiming to build a “useful, error-corrected quantum computer” by the end of the decade, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/unveiling-our-new-quantum-ai-campus/"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The search giant hopes the technology will help solve a range of big problems like feeding the world and climate change to developing better medicines. To develop the technology, Google has unveiled a new Quantum AI campus in Santa Barbara containing a quantum data center, hardware research labs, and quantum processor chip fabrication facilities. It will spend billions developing the technology over the next decade, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-aims-for-commercial-grade-quantum-computer-by-2029-11621359156?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2Eje2"&gt;The target announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22435419/google-io-2021-event-recap-biggest-announcements-pixel-android-12-wear-os-workspace"&gt;Google I/O on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; comes a year and a half after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone"&gt;Google said it had achieved quantum supremacy&lt;/a&gt;, a milestone where a quantum computer has performed a calculation that would be impossible on a traditional classical computer. Google says its quantum computer was able to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken 10,000 years or more on a traditional supercomputer. But competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18171732/ibm-quantum-computer-20-qubit-q-system-one-ces-2019"&gt;racing to build quantum computers of their own&lt;/a&gt; cast doubt on Google’s claimed progress. Rather than taking 10,000 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/"&gt;IBM argued at the time&lt;/a&gt; that a traditional supercomputer could actually perform the task in 2.5 days or less.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtNfmMYgXwI0yWyilhvwDuU4Jlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525094/1_294_R01_1.max_1000x1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Quantum AI campus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VJYZj7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:2235291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LnjMk8"&gt;This extra processing power could be useful to simulate molecules, and hence nature, accurately, Google says. This might help us design better batteries, creating more carbon-efficient fertilizer, or develop more targeted medicines, because a quantum computer could run simulations before a company invests in building real-world prototypes. Google also expects quantum computing to have big benefits for AI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqSEdq"&gt;Despite claiming to have hit the quantum supremacy milestone, Google says it has a long way to go before such computers are useful. While current quantum computers are made up of less than 100 qubits, Google is targeting machine built with 1,000,000. Getting there is a multistage process. Google says it first needs to cut down on the errors qubits make, before it can think about building 1,000 physical qubits together into a single logical qubit. This will lay the groundwork for the “quantum transistor,” a building block of future quantum computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FmySW"&gt;Despite the challenges ahead, Google is optimistic about its chances. “We are at this inflection point,” the scientist in charge of Google’s Quantum AI program, Hartmut Neven, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-aims-for-commercial-grade-quantum-computer-by-2029-11621359156?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We now have the important components in hand that make us confident. We know how to execute the road map.” Google’s eventually plans to offer quantum computing services over the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jQAjF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch Online reaches more than 100 retro games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/neNRmFFMIIa618oiODEKs1HcvTM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69309252/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="678304"&gt;Nintendo has hit a milestone with the ever-growing library of retro games included in its Nintendo Switch Online service. The next batch will take the number of available games past 100, with five new titles resulting in a total of 104.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQPLfx"&gt;In keeping with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;recent form&lt;/a&gt;, the latest additions are, well, not necessarily blockbuster releases. Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SASp2K"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Caveman Ninja: Joe &amp;amp; Mac&lt;/em&gt;, a prehistoric action game released in arcades and ported to the SNES by Data East in 1991&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HuXhNf"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Magical Drop 2&lt;/em&gt;, a 1996 Data East puzzle game for the SNES that was originally on the Neo Geo but never previously got a Western release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7Cyo07"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Super Baseball Simulator 1.000&lt;/em&gt;, a SNES baseball game released by Culture Brain in 1991&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RKzYry"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spanky’s Quest&lt;/em&gt;, a 1991 SNES action game by Natsume about a monkey with a magic bubble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZCyMhT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ninja JaJaMaru-kun, &lt;/em&gt;a popular Jaleco NES action game released in 1985; it was only ever released in Japan but did come to the Wii Virtual Console around the world in 2007&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Iu7L5W"&gt;So no, still no &lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVnb2J"&gt;Nintendo is, of course, constrained in what it can release on the service for various reasons including licensing issues, and it is cool to see some more obscure titles get spotlighted. But it’s clear that there isn’t much left in the NES and SNES pipeline, and it’d be a good time for the company to start thinking about perhaps moving on to the N64 — especially now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which includes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;) has been removed from sale forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jf3AkK"&gt;Until that hypothetical possibility transpires, you’ll be able to play the five new games when they’re added to the service on May 26th. Nintendo Switch Online costs $3.99 a month or $19.99 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At the Epic trial, Phil Schiller got away clean</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phil schiller wwdc 2013" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d436xwVq7YrsJxFcEoXtdek2efQ=/0x0:1014x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69308782/2013-06-10phil_schiller.1419980091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;phil schiller wwdc 2013&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ohf59d"&gt;Phil Schiller is one of the biggest names at Apple, and at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, his job was to make Apple feel small. Over two days of testimony including several hours of cross-examination, he didn’t always succeed — but he left the stand without facing some of Epic’s harshest lines of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0iCoi"&gt;Schiller, whose title is simply “Apple Fellow,” has spent more than 30 years with the company. In his testimony, he recounted joining Apple in the ‘90s and watching Steve Jobs reorganize the then-failing computer maker. He reminisced about the iPod and name-dropped largely forgotten competitors like Handango and BlackBerry Messenger. In court, Epic Games has portrayed Apple as a scolding, disingenuous bully that locks users into a walled garden and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429267/epic-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-trial-peely-day-6"&gt;gets mad at cartoon bananas&lt;/a&gt;. Schiller countered with an iOS product showcase and Apple history lesson, and Epic didn’t do much to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsPov4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schiller countered Epic with an Apple history lesson&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L4INfY"&gt;The iPod bit was a great encapsulation of Schiller’s time on the stand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;As my colleague Liz Lopatto notes&lt;/a&gt;, Schiller famously served as Apple’s longtime marketing head. But at the prompting of an Apple lawyer, Schiller mentioned on Tuesday that he’d also helped invent the iPod clickwheel — one of Apple’s most distinctive hardware designs. And why, Apple’s counsel asked, was a marketing executive working on hardware design? “Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects,” Schiller explained. Different parts of Apple simply aren’t siloed into neat divisions; it’s one tight-knit company that makes a many-featured product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or3Ysc"&gt;That anecdote buttressed a more legally pertinent claim: because of this management system, Apple allegedly has no idea how much the App Store makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbpYiD"&gt;One Epic-paid expert witness has pegged Apple’s operating margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;between 70 and 80 percent&lt;/a&gt;, something Epic calls evidence of monopoly power. Epic used one of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2017%2F06%2Fdeveloper-earnings-from-the-app-store-top-70-billion%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22442395%2Fat-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s PR statistics&lt;/a&gt; to estimate the App Store made $20 billion or more in commissions by 2017. Schiller didn’t dispute the number. But he said Apple never calculated its overall profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iSlQkC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Product marketing works hand-in-hand with engineering on all of our projects”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vcyx62"&gt;“We don’t deny that it likely is. It’s just that we haven’t managed the business that way,” Schiller said of the App Store. He rattled off iPhone features that require lots of work and benefit App Store developers, but don’t involve spending money on the store itself. Epic attorney Katherine Forrest was incredulous: “Apple can do accelerometers, and machine learning, and have some of the most sophisticated technology around, and it can’t figure out if the App Store is profitable — is that what you’re saying?” Schiller, however, never changed his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QtsNu"&gt;Apple used Schiller to put a new spin on Epic’s other evidence against it. Epic has cited a 2008 message where he said opening up iOS would mean “throwing out the whole plan” for the operating system. But where Epic described that plan as a single monopolistic gambit, Schiller says he was just describing the straightforward goal of a central App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bkt8Dr"&gt;“You keep going back to that sentence referring to ‘the plan,’ as if there was one special plan that we referred to,” he complained at one point. Where Epic has pointed out phrases like “lock-in” and seeking “stickiness” on iOS, Schiller emphasized that the “stickiness” involved trying to add features that would discourage phishing. “If there’s any plan here, it’s simply to come up with new features to help protect users from security and privacy scams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n72rMO"&gt;Some choices are tougher to spin as fair-minded altruism. One court filing suggests Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;kept iMessage off Android&lt;/a&gt; to discourage switching ecosystems, and another recounts a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;list of sweetener deals&lt;/a&gt; that Apple discussed offering Netflix, despite claims to not favor individual developers. iMessage and the App Store play a huge role in consumer technology, and Epic’s counsel had a chance to push Schiller on them, helping the rest of us better understand how Apple makes these calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjggQl"&gt;But mostly, Epic... just didn’t. Cross-examination touched on topics like iMessage, but Epic’s counsel favored exhaustive readings of policies and lists that could show Apple in an unfavorable light, including every time it mentions relying on open source software and the search results for “BDSM” on the App Store. Little of this related to Schiller himself, although we did glean details like his favorite &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins (&lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_Agent"&gt;Rogue Agent&lt;/a&gt; and the New England Patriots), his use of Reddit (“I tried it once”), and whether knows what Pornhub is (allegedly, no.) And while Schiller occasionally sounded frustrated, he stuck to his central claims: the App Store can’t be carved out or measured, and even if it’s made Apple rich, it’s helped everyone else as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify and YouTube Music will bring much needed offline tunes to Google’s Wear watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6kJ4haWEfqAd8S4oNpCKg3ae4g=/110x0:1910x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69308705/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_3.50.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0Yflx"&gt;Spotify’s product lead for cars and wearables teased an exciting new feature coming to Wear devices &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D_mVOAXcrtc?t=2515"&gt;during Google’s Developer Keynote&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday: the ability for the streaming services’ &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/"&gt;356 million users&lt;/a&gt; to download music directly to their watch, and listen to it at times when they don’t want to carry their phone (&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/spotify-download-music-podcasts-wear-os/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The feature isn’t included in the redesign that was just released, but Spotify says that it’s currently in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkmrOK"&gt;The announcement came alongside Google’s reveal that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;merging Wear OS with Samsung’s Tizen&lt;/a&gt;. During Tuesday’s I/O keynote, Google promised that the updated OS would bring faster performance and longer battery life, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;currently still issues&lt;/a&gt; for Wear OS watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oZVpLZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spotify: &lt;a href="https://t.co/wpZFJh8hVN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wpZFJh8hVN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kirubhas Shankar (@KirubhasWasHere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KirubhasWasHere/status/1394771887796854784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jBcOmX"&gt;The YouTube Music app is also getting an update, which will similarly add the ability to download music directly to Wear devices, allowing users to listen without a phone nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_N-IMmAkdb8WH9BRzslPy_HcF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524354/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_5.21.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube Music will also support downloads. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HhjlXA"&gt;Google’s smartwatch OS has lagged behind Apple’s in many ways, including offline music listening. The Apple Watch has been able to play songs downloaded through Apple Music when away from a phone for years, and it got to the point where Google decided to release its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21518580/youtube-music-apple-watch-app-wear-os-wearable-problems"&gt;YouTube Music app for the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; before its own Wear OS. When &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-to-listen-to-your-music-on-any-smartwatch-1845624102"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;put out an article&lt;/a&gt; last November on how listen to music phone-free on smartwatches, its Wear OS recommendation was more or less an app that acted as an MP3 player, requiring the transfer of local files that you already own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWzjZE"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-play-music-wont-work-soon-on-wear-os-smartwatches"&gt;the shutdown of Google Play Music&lt;/a&gt;, Wear OS users haven’t had many options for offline music. But now, Google’s Wear watches could potentially even leapfrog the Apple Watch when it comes to offline Spotify playback — to get your Spotify on an Apple Watch without carrying around your phone, you currently need an active internet connection to stream it to one of Apple’s pricier cellular Apple Watch models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549483/spotify-apple-watch-streaming-music-rolling-out"&gt;a feature added late last year.&lt;/a&gt; Some other watches have had offline Spotify playback in the past, though, like Garmin’s flagship Forerunner sports watches and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/listen-to-spotify-offline-from-galaxy-wearable/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some Samsung Galaxy wearables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNvaLL"&gt;You can check out the Spotify and YouTube Music app reveals for yourself in Google’s Wear-specific session from I/O. The YouTube Music announcement starts at 2:38, and the Spotify demo starts at 12:50 in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Top streamer says Twitch revoked her ability to run ads without warning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFR3Mi6W2tBTO3hBbr95mhfXf4U=/124x0:1885x1174/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69308051/amouranth.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amouranth during an ASMR stream. | Image: Amouranth / Twitch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Apva6"&gt;Twitch has removed the ability for Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa, one of the most popular streamers on its platform, to run ads on her videos — even though it’s unclear that she broke any of the site’s rules. Siragusa said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Amouranth/status/1394699159983243268"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that it’s because her streams are “not advertiser friendly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuP4jt"&gt;Siragusa is known for streaming herself chatting and gaming while wearing swimsuits. She’s hugely popular, with more than 20,000 subscribers — putting her among the site’s top 20, &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers"&gt;according to TwitchTracker&lt;/a&gt;. She’s also been the target of relentless criticism because of her appearance, including sexist attacks from Twitch users who argue that the success of some women on the platform is unearned or illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgMxDn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is an ALARMING precedent and serves as a stark warning that although content may not ostensibly break community guidelines or Terms of service, Twitch has complete discretion to target individual channels &amp;amp; partially or wholly demonetized them for&lt;/p&gt;— Amouranth (@Amouranth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Amouranth/status/1394699454654124033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LSQZSq"&gt;The advertising ban comes months into what’s become known as the “&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitchs-hot-tub-meta-has-sparked-off-yet-another-debate-1846600932"&gt;hot tub meta&lt;/a&gt;” on Twitch. It’s become a trend for creators to stream themselves hanging out or playing games in hot tubs or inflatable pools. Siragusa has been a contributor to that trend, streaming from what appears to be a small plastic pool set up inside her home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tD8PJS"&gt;But it’s not known why Twitch revoked Siragusa’s ability to run ads — a punishment the site has never doled out before, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-takes-away-most-popular-hot-tub-streamers-abilit-1846919420"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s part of what makes this situation so concerning for streamers: Twitch has an explicit set of rules that streamers need to follow to avoid a ban, but there’s no specific rules around who can and can’t be supported by advertising. Twitch allows streamers to appear in swimwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnQ0mM"&gt;Siragusa said on Twitter that she reached out to Twitch after discovering she had lost advertising revenue and was told yesterday that she had been “indefinitely suspended” from running ads. “This is an ALARMING precedent,” she wrote, saying there were no communicated guidelines for why her ad privileges were revoked. “There is no known policy for what results in a streamer being put on this blacklist,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vmItW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Twitch for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google employees call for company to support Palestinians and protect anti-Zionist speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WDZSvVvFSo47HQfjNm592iqnxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307824/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6DJ9Y"&gt;A group of Jewish Google employees is calling on the company to increase its support of Palestinians amid Israel’s deadly bombing campaign in Gaza. The conflict started with Israel’s attempt to evict Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/10/22428819/israel-palestine-jerusalem-mosque-violence-biden"&gt;and escalated when militants fired rockets toward Jerusalem and Israel responded with airstrikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBOoOW"&gt;In an internal letter, Google workers ask CEO Sundar Pichai to put out a statement condemning the attacks, including “direct recognition of the harm done to Palestinians by Israeli military and gang violence.” The letter currently has 250 signatures. (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck0yb4OgXJlf5N2Ap21BhW-QNTL0rigFSYsW_o09QkJOJVbw/viewform"&gt;An external version of the note can be found here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SK3kAr"&gt;The request is coming from a new employee resource group which formed last year in response to pro-Zionist sentiment within “Jewglers” — Google’s official Jewish ERG. While Jewglers has tried to be apolitical, two current workers say it has supported pro-Israel discussions and is not a safe space to express anti-Zionist beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tTJrb"&gt;This rift led to the formation of the Jewish Diaspora in Tech — a group of Jewish anti-nationalists within Google. “We were compelled to form our own space because of the fact that we were quite literally not allowed to express our viewpoints in the ERG,” says a product marketing manager in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHYeKc"&gt;Now, members of the new organization are calling on Google to support freedom of expression internally — particularly around anti-Zionist viewpoints. “Google is the world’s largest search engine and any repression of freedom of expression occurring within the company is a danger not only to Googlers internally but to all people around the world,” they wrote in an FAQ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lKJZG"&gt;They also want Google to terminate any business contracts which support “Israeli violations of Palestinian human rights, such as the Israeli Defense Forces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KE5dZ"&gt;Members of the group say they were inspired to write the letter after Jewglers failed to put out a statement condemning the violence against Palestinians. One worker told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that people in the group were promoting pro-Israel funding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsOKf8"&gt;Read the entire letter below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DZ2qtm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10507005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cFYBP3"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon extends ban on police use of its facial recognition software ‘until further notice’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2sz0ifqs-3Qj8Eel3feJqezTrzI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69307460/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GNVmPJ"&gt;Amazon has extended its moratorium on law enforcement use of its facial recognition software “until further notice,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./technology/exclusive-amazon-extends-moratorium-police-use-facial-recognition-software-2021-05-18/?utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ban was set to expire in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEU0CY"&gt;As early as 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492106/amazon-ice-facial-recognition-internal-letter-protest"&gt;Amazon employees&lt;/a&gt; had pushed Amazon to scale back the project, arguing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18291995/amazon-facial-recognition-technology-rekognition-police-ai-researchers-ban-flawed"&gt;documented racial bias in facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; could exacerbate police violence against minorities. Amazon defended the project until June 2020, when increased pressure from widespread protests led to the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;announcing a yearlong moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on police clients for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYv8TW"&gt;Rekognition is offered as an AWS service, and many of Amazon’s cloud computing competitors have similar technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288053/microsoft-facial-recognition-police-law-enforcement-pledge-regulation"&gt;Microsoft announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would also not be selling its facial recognition services to police the day after Amazon’s pledge, and IBM said that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software"&gt;would stop developing or researching&lt;/a&gt; facial recognition tech altogether the same week. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075001/facial-recognition-ban-google-microsoft-eu-sundar-pichai-brad-smith"&gt;doesn’t commercially offer its facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCvvsi"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to request for comment about why the ban was being extended. In a statement provided when the ban on law enforcement use was first issued, Amazon said it hoped Congress would use the year provided by the moratorium to implement rules surrounding the ethical use of facial recognition technology. Part of its statement read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ofTctf"&gt;We’ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xRb4bl"&gt;So far, no federal legislation has addressed police use of facial recognition, but a number of state and local measures have passed paring back use of the technology. San Francisco was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;the first US city to ban government use of facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697821/oakland-facial-recogntiion-ban-vote-governement-california"&gt;Oakland following soon after&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21536892/portland-maine-facial-recognition-ban-passed-surveillance"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; cities of Portland also passed legislation around the tech in late 2020. The state of Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179245/facial-recognition-bill-ban-rejected-massachusetts-governor-charlie-baker-police-accountability"&gt;failed to pass a proposed ban&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020 but &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/07/982709480/massachusetts-pioneers-rules-for-police-use-of-facial-recognition-tech"&gt;has recently passed a modified bill&lt;/a&gt; that adds some restrictions on police use of facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

The Android 12 public beta is currently available for Google’s Pixel phones (Pixel 3 and up) and will also come to devices from OnePlus, Lenovo, Asus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, TCL, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE. You can enroll your Pixel phone on &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;Google’s Android beta site&lt;/a&gt; or find specific instructions for other supported phones on &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;the Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkQBw"&gt;Android 12 brings a cornucopia of new features, but the most exciting are the new visuals. Along with new animations, widgets, and a modified lock screen, Android 12 also offers theming, with the ability to change the colors used across the OS just by changing your wallpaper. Not all of the dramatic visual changes will be available in this first beta, but they should roll out over time as we get closer to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3nlq1"&gt;Google is tweaking other aspects of the Android experience as well, like notifications and quick settings. It’s also making some improvements to privacy and security, with indicators for when your phone’s camera or microphones are in use, and easier access to all of your apps’ various permissions in one dashboard.

&lt;h2 id="pqo2S3"&gt;How to install the Android 12 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DcweJw"&gt;The process of how you get Android 12 beta on your phone ranges from requiring just a few clicks to something more involved. For this beta download, it’s considerably easier to get the it on one of the supported Google Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nukaT"&gt;For a Pixel, begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;visiting the Android 12 beta site to enroll your phone in the beta&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to find your phone listed when you click “View your eligible devices.” After you enroll your device, you might be nudged via a notification on your phone that the software is ready to install. If you want to check manually, open the settings menu on your phone, then head to System &amp;gt; System Update. Tap “Check for update” to see if you can download the new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5turHD"&gt;If nothing happens right away, your only option is to keep waiting. In the past, I’ve gotten the beta update on my phone within minutes of enrolling, though sometimes it takes hours. It may take over 24 hours for the software to be ready to install on your phone, so hang tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feWDkB"&gt;As for supported phones from other brands like OnePlus, Realme, Sharp, and others, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices"&gt;follow the instructions on each page&lt;/a&gt; from Google’s list of eligible phones, as the process for installation seems to differ depending on the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
