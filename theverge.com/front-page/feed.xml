    <title>Resident Evil Village is coming to Stadia, and Google will give you free hardware if you buy this version</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5c1jLxze7MrGRoPhPZxRyfhSZRc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005987/EsRryLBXIAAE_Yd.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q8u65h"&gt;We already knew that &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will release on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;a slew of platforms&lt;/a&gt;, including the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S. And today, Google announced that the game will also arrive on Stadia. To encourage you to buy this version, Google will throw in a free Stadia Premiere kit to anyone who preorders &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; before May 21st. The promotion is available for both the Standard and Deluxe Editions of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, which cost $60 and $70, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6DlPc"&gt;Normally priced at $100, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735364132370054225#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Stadia Premiere Edition&lt;/a&gt; features a white Stadia controller, a Chromecast Ultra, and, for new users, a one-month trial subscription to Stadia’s Pro-tier service. Stadia Pro includes 4K streaming and a growing collection of free games, similar to Sony’s PlayStation Plus service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PPIVzf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google had a similar promotion last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLVKa0"&gt;Google had a similar promotion last year when it offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;complimentary hardware if you preordered the Stadia version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; promotion announcement comes at an interesting time as Stadia’s future looks questionable. In February, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its internal Stadia development studio&lt;/a&gt;. That same month, reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-stadia-games-entertainment-collapse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shed light on some of the tech giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios"&gt;failures in building its cloud gaming platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H52v52"&gt;Before &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; arrives on May 7th, Google also announced today that Stadia Pro members can redeem a free copy of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7 Gold Edition&lt;/em&gt; when the game launches on the cloud gaming service on April 1st. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poco’s new phones have new-ish Snapdragon processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mzt4Y7lQSTgD5NhCWmDF6E_REj0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005989/DSCF7676.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FXJ9tW"&gt;Xiaomi-owned Poco has returned with two new phones that have some notable processor choices at low prices. Both the X3 Pro and the F3 use new Qualcomm chips that are essentially updated and repurposed flagship-class processors from the past couple of years, which make them an interesting price-performance proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7002et"&gt;First up is the Poco X3 Pro (pictured above and below), which is essentially identical to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426866/xiaomi-poco-x3-nfc-hands-on-price-specs-release"&gt;last year’s Poco X3 NFC&lt;/a&gt; but with a new processor. That means there’s still a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p LCD, a 5,160mAh battery with 33W fast charging, and a quad-camera setup headlined by a 48-megapixel primary sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO4fOD"&gt;What’s new is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 SoC, which hasn’t previously been announced. The processor appears to be a new version of the Snapdragon 855, Qualcomm’s flagship part from two years ago found in phones like the Galaxy S10 and the Pixel 4. It uses the same Kryo 485 core based on ARM’s Cortex-A76 CPU, but the clock speed has been slightly bumped to up to 2.96GHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNOKrC"&gt;Poco describes the 860 as “the leading 4G flagship processor in 2021,” which doesn’t strike me as a field with a whole lot of competition. Still, it will likely outperform newer mid-range 5G chips like the 765.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/seAR_5vKNHpwmjslPQBEQtNKlH8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388255/DSCF7678.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OMJJS7"&gt;The Poco F3, meanwhile, is a higher-end device that’s one of the first phones to use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22233584/qualcomm-snapdragon-870-865-plus-refresh-processor-smartphones-2021"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago. The 870 is a similar idea to the 860 but based on the one-year-newer 865, which was Qualcomm’s highest-end chip in 2020. The CPU clock speed has again received a slight bump to a max of 3.2GHz. The 870 won’t be as fast as the 888, but another way to think of it is that it would’ve been the fastest Android phone chip in the world a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybBjzu"&gt;The F3 itself is a rebranded version of Xiaomi’s Redmi K40, which was recently released in China. It has a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p OLED display, a 4,520mAh battery with 33W fast charging, and a triple-camera setup including a 48-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and what seems to be the same 5-megapixel “telemacro” found on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;the Xiaomi Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh2NyF"&gt;Poco hasn’t announced full global release details yet, but the X3 Pro costs €199 for a model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (or €249 for 8GB/256GB), while the F3 is €299 for 6GB/128GB and €349 for 8GB/256GB. Those are early-bird prices — all models will be bumped up by €50 after April 1st for the X3 Pro and April 6th for the F3. Even after that, though, they look like very good value for their segment. Both phones will go on sale later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer sets new goals to cut down its climate pollution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Designs for a video game controller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIycHyO98DgNU3u7s38dhZt9iz0=/0x1:1504x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005985/Raiju_2017_design_story__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer says it will design products to create less climate pollution. | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gJLIzo"&gt;Razer announced today that it plans to become carbon neutral by 2030, meaning it plans to reduce and offset its carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rinai"&gt;As part of that goal, the company says its global offices will run on renewable energy by 2025. It also says it will design products to create less climate pollution and will slash emissions from its manufacturing processes. Razer is also trying to reduce waste by eliminating single-use plastics from its offices this decade and switching to biodegradable packaging for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/razer"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DYMIMD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Razer is the latest tech company to announce new climate goals for the decade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O1ExLD"&gt;It’s the latest tech company to announce new climate goals for the decade. Razer competitor Logitech also recently made commitments to cut down on its greenhouse gas pollution. It set a goal of powering all of its electricity consumption globally from renewables by 2030. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21284528/logitech-carbon-impact-labels-products-packaging"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, it started labeling its products with how much carbon dioxide they generate across their entire lifespan — from manufacturing to usage and disposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPm70l"&gt;Larger tech companies have set even more ambitious goals. Microsoft has been carbon neutral since 2012. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;recently pledged&lt;/a&gt; to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it releases by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWGu0z"&gt;All of these commitments are supposed to prevent climate change from getting much worse than it already is. Global carbon dioxide emissions need to reach close to zero by 2050 in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change, &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/"&gt;according to leading climate scientists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01Ioer"&gt;To keep the world on track, companies like Razer will need to be transparent about their progress toward their new goals. Razer hasn’t specified what proportion of its emissions it plans to actually cut versus how much it will try to offset or cancel out by investing in things like forest conservation projects. The company said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that reducing emissions by turning to renewable energy is “a priority” — but when that’s “not available or possible,” then it will rely on things like forest-related offsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e95cZM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Razer will need to be transparent about its progress&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUTADp"&gt;Razer recently pledged to “&lt;a href="https://press.razer.com/company-news/razer-and-the-global-gaming-community-push-to-save-one-million-trees-with-sneki-snek/"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt;” 1 million trees by fundraising for the nonprofit group Conservation International. It’s selling plushies of its mascot “Sneki Snek” and other merchandise to raise money for the effort. Trees &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; trap and store carbon dioxide — but relying on them to save our butts from climate change has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;faced criticism from scientists&lt;/a&gt;. There’s been a history of &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;forestry projects failing&lt;/a&gt; to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the long term. That means for Razer to have the biggest impact on the climate, it will have to follow through on cutting down emissions as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash will let you order at-home COVID-19 testing kits delivered to your door</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iq-ByWCgYFEMr89hi7KUNXdg1PU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005664/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rwwgy8"&gt;DoorDash has partnered with two US-based digital health companies, Vault Health and Everlywell, to help distribute at-home COVID-19 test kits across the country, the company announced on Monday. The partnerships will allow DoorDash customers to order the testing kits directly from the company’s app in 12 markets or, conversely, to order the kits from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vaulthealth.com%2Fcovid&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22340706%2Fdoordash-covid-home-testing-kits-delivery-vault-health-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vault Health’s website&lt;/a&gt; in 20 markets with same-day delivery from DoorDash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ8N9x"&gt;Both kits contain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which is a molecular test and considered the most accurate of the testing varieties on the market. Both kits have also received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for at-home testing. The Everlywell testing kit ($109) is a self-administered nasal swab that can be done unsupervised, while the Vault Health kit ($119) is a saliva test that involves supervision from a staffer over Zoom. Both companies promise to return results within 24 to 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P4I_CNNHLXjnkCyXjuu2DR-ZMY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388449/PRImage_COVIDTests.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DoorDash&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HC5VXK"&gt;The markets supported by the DoorDash app include Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, and Phoenix, with more cities to be added soon, the company says. Vault Health’s direct online order option will be supported in Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and San Diego, among other markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dUolQ"&gt;The initiative is part of DoorDash’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355625/doordash-dashmart-convenience-store-launch-snacks-groceries"&gt;DashMart convenience store platform&lt;/a&gt;, a new type of virtual marketplace the company launched last summer as the pandemic was in full swing. DashMarts act similar to a CVS or 7-Eleven but they’re available at all hours of the day from the DoorDash app for ordering convenience store items, light food and groceries, and other products you’d typically find at a corner store or pharmacy. The stores also source from a variety of different vendors, so there’s just not one list of limited inventory to choose  from. In some cases, DoorDash even sources local restaurants’ products to give DashMart the feel of a boutique store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixwCgZ"&gt;Now, in addition to buying supplies, food, and other items, you’ll also be able to start buying COVID-19 testing kits in what DoorDash is positioning as a push into health products. “Amidst the pandemic, one of our priorities has been to make health and wellness essentials more accessible for customers, with the goal of helping businesses leverage our last-mile logistics infrastructure to provide more convenient and timely access to their health supplies,” Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart, director of new verticals at DoorDash, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

Each of these phones will arrive factory unlocked and be usable with most carriers that support 4G LTE. They’re in new / open-box condition, which the seller indicates as meaning the phones show no signs of wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV6GXu"&gt;eBay allows up to 60 days to make a return, and the phones are covered with a 90-day warranty. It’s unclear if these models are still covered by Google’s one-year manufacturer warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6AlOh"&gt;This could be a good deal for you if you have either the Pixel 2 or Pixel 3 and want to extend how long you’ll get major software updates without breaking the bank. (The Pixel 2 won’t get Android 12, while it’s the last big update for the Pixel 3.) For the price, the Pixel 4 offers better performance than the Pixel 3A and 4A, as well as a 90Hz refresh rate screen to make everything animate more fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="kuTwx3"&gt;Speaking of video games, if you have a Nintendo Switch, you owe it to yourself to get the best controller made for that platform. Nintendo’s own Switch Pro controller is usually $70 (rarely dropping in price), but it’s $59 at a few retailers right now. I know, that’s the price of a new game, but if you value comfort, long-lasting battery life, and just all-around good build quality, you should pick this up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spJhXlqpS2ljV6inVMR0CTAysv4=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005552/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our desks can tell their own stories — and ours&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CGOpiX"&gt;Now that many of us are working from home (and it looks some will continue to do so, even after we’ve gotten past the worst of the pandemic), one of the most important places in those homes is our workspaces — in other words, our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6iJY2"&gt;Everyone’s workspace is different. What kind of desk — and desk chair — do you use? Is your workspace neat and organized or filled with tchotchkes and toys? Do you have an old-fashioned wooden desk or a mechanized standing desk? Are you sitting on a stool or the latest Herman Miller desk chair? Is your workspace filled with this year’s high-end tech for working and gaming, or are you happy with a five-year-old laptop and a pair of headphones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiPNnQ"&gt;In our “What’s on your desk?” series, we look into how people organize and use their workspace so that you can find out all of the various ways we see our spaces and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C33Cp8"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod mini reportedly has a secret temperature and humidity sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD_fj5raCoRVePli0YJ9Ge0ocWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005418/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HomePod mini, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="77cWg6"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini smart speaker has an as-yet-undisclosed temperature and humidity sensor in its casing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor’s exact location was confirmed by iFixit, and it appears to be placed away from the speaker’s internal components so it can measure the external temperature. The exact sensor used is a 1.5 x 1.5mm HDC2010 Humidity and Temperature Digital Sensor from Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70XPfF"&gt;Although the sensor isn’t currently usable by HomePod mini owners, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Apple has internally discussed allowing the sensor to provide information to other smart home devices like thermostats or fans. This could give smart heating equipment more information about how warm a room is or allow the speaker to trigger a device like a fan if it senses a room has reached a certain temperature. The functionality could work via HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, which currently integrates with dozens of internet-connected thermostats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N5TJSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The sensor may eventually be used with HomeKit devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qi1Th"&gt;Amazon has previously included temperature sensors in Echo speakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;its 2020 model&lt;/a&gt;, where the sensor can be used to trigger other devices via Alexa routines. Meanwhile, Google sells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17820594/nest-thermostat-remote-temperature-sensors-review-price-specs"&gt;standalone sensors via its Nest sub-brand&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Hub announced last week&lt;/a&gt; also includes a similar built-in sensor to help monitor your room’s temperature while you sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQzZm6"&gt;Although Apple declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; on its report (and did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request for comment), on at least one occasion, it’s included hardware in a device that’s only been officially activated months later. Its 2008 iPod touch included a Bluetooth chip, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, but it wasn’t able to connect with Bluetooth devices until the year after its release. The hope is that a similar software update may be on the way for the HomePod mini. For those keeping track, major new HomePod firmware tends to release in the fall of each year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to start reopening headquarters on March 29th, with hybrid workplace focus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L3kUbAJNZQWFne5U2upN_xqabBU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005322/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDr8uT"&gt;Microsoft is planning to start reopening its Redmond and Seattle, Washington-based headquarters later this month. The software giant originally started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164522/microsoft-coronavirus-response-comment-employees-memo-work-from-home"&gt;encouraging employees to work from home&lt;/a&gt; more than a year ago, just as the coronavirus pandemic began, and the company’s main US offices have remained closed for months as a result. This will start to change on March 29th, with a limited reopening of Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond and Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvMu86"&gt;“Currently, Microsoft work sites in 21 countries have been able to accommodate additional workers in our facilities – representing around 20% of our global employee population,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/22/the-philosophy-and-practice-of-our-hybrid-workplace/"&gt;says Kurt DelBene&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of corporate strategy. “On March 29, Microsoft will also start making this shift at our Redmond, Washington, headquarters and nearby campuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdU4Q"&gt;Microsoft says it’s taking this gradual approach to be in line with local authority restrictions and that the company has determined it can now safely accommodate more workers while sticking to Washington state capacity limits. “As we watch for progress against the virus in the region and continue to evaluate our guidance, employees who work at Redmond work sites or nearby campuses have the choice to return to those facilities or to continue working remotely, and also have the flexibility to do a mixture of both,” explains DelBene.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8oBKe1ZLHufCw8onyxAkhusZDWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388422/rXHFyu8.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s hybrid workplace dial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bFlbZ9"&gt;This is the beginning of a reopening of Microsoft’s offices, as part of six stages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349969/microsoft-offices-reopen-january-2021-workplace-dial"&gt;the company outlined last year&lt;/a&gt;. This is stage four, or what’s called a soft opening, to allow more employees back. Stage five moves offices into open with restrictions, before stage six is fully open without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHDZS8"&gt;Alongside this reopening, Microsoft is also focusing on a hybrid workplace as it anticipates a continued demand for remote working and flexibility among its own employees and elsewhere. Microsoft is releasing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fworklab%2Fwork-trend-index%2Fhybrid-work" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 version of its Work Trend Index&lt;/a&gt;, a report that includes data and research on how employees and businesses are responding to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1FuZj"&gt;Microsoft has found that 73 percent of workers surveyed want to continue with flexible remote work. Microsoft itself now considers working from home part-time as standard for employees, and the company is looking into new ways of using technology to bridge the gap between remote work and traditional offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9rTG1"&gt;“We’ve pulled together a group of Microsoft researchers, engineers and real estate and facilities experts to prototype hybrid meeting spaces at our Redmond, Washington, and U.K. campuses,” explains DelBene. “The group is investigating different meeting configurations and technologies like multiple screens, cameras and mixed reality scenarios to understand the most effective, inclusive set-up for hybrid work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wQ54kE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this is what Microsoft Teams and the future of work will look like, according to Microsoft &lt;a href="https://t.co/rpHMtux3c8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rpHMtux3c8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1366814328704409604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDw9u"&gt;This work is still early, but Microsoft is prototyping tweaking existing technology to help with meetings and remote work and even improving Microsoft Teams to bridge the gap. That may well involve turning all of the screens in your home into Teams-capable devices to allow home workers to see employees on the big screen. Microsoft hinted at this type of concept during its Ignite event earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INwA2Y"&gt;“Though we don’t know how far off a new normal is, we are adapting to a new way of working with an expanded understanding of flexibility,” says DelBene. “We know there are thousands of ways of working – in the last year our employees have shown what is possible – and we believe that flexibility is essential to maintaining work-life balance.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine 79 percent effective in US study</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CYPRUS-HEALTH-VIRUS-PANDEMIC-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Z3iWGCe_tOzqTDGNwhRJqyoH5M=/44x0:4198x2769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69005164/1231870504.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Etienne Torbey / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjjM7t"&gt;A fourth COVID-19 vaccine has shown that it can protect people against the worst effects of the disease in a large United States-based trial. Two doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine were 79 percent effective at preventing people from developing symptomatic COVID-19, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the company today. No one in the US trial who received the vaccine was hospitalized for COVID-19, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxUm3Q"&gt;It’s a good result for a vaccine that’s been dogged by clinical trial issues, poor transparency, and skepticism &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274371/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa-variant"&gt;since last fall&lt;/a&gt;. AstraZeneca said the vaccine was up to 90 percent effective in November based on data from the United Kingdom and Brazil, but that number was based on a half-dose of the vaccine given to trial participants by mistake. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/astra-vaccine-shows-82-efficacy-with-3-month-gap-oxford-says"&gt;Additional analyses&lt;/a&gt; found that the two-dose vaccine was around 82 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 when the doses were given three months apart. It has already been authorized and is being used in other countries around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVJvgu"&gt;The company said that participants in the clinical trial did not have any usual or dangerous blood clotting. Over the past few weeks, some European countries halted the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine after at least 13 people who received the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/it-s-very-special-picture-why-vaccine-safety-experts-put-brakes-astrazeneca-s-covid-19"&gt;showed signs&lt;/a&gt; of an unusual clotting disorder. It’s not clear if the vaccine is linked to the disorder, and the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots"&gt;European Medicines Agency said&lt;/a&gt; the benefits of the vaccine outweigh that potential rare risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVnjI6"&gt;Today’s release did not include any information on how well the vaccine performed against variant forms of the coronavirus. South Africa stopped using the AstraZeneca vaccine in February after a small study found that it did not protect against mild and moderate COVID-19 caused by the B.1.351 variant. That variant was first found in South Africa and may dodge antibodies created by vaccines. However, the vaccine &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779160"&gt;appears effective&lt;/a&gt; against the more-contagious B.1.1.7 variant, which took over in the United Kingdom and is now spreading in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIqQXZ"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, this vaccine was made using a weakened form of an adenovirus, which usually causes mild illnesses like pink eye. The gene for part of the coronavirus called the spike protein is inserted into that virus. When the vaccine is injected, the body makes copies of the spike protein and produces antibodies that can fight the coronavirus. This vaccine can also be stored in the refrigerator and is relatively cheap, especially compared to the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHpy8B"&gt;AstraZeneca said it plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization in the United States “in the coming weeks.” But the US may end up not using much of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the vaccine, even if it is authorized. The country already has orders for enough doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines to cover every adult &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/merck-johnson-johnson-vaccine.html"&gt;by the end of May&lt;/a&gt;. The US has tens of millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on hand, and it announced last week that it plans to send at least 4 million of them &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/world/americas/usa-mexico-vaccine-coronavirus.html"&gt;to Canada and Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Envy x360 15 with AMD Ryzen chips starts at $749.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Envy x360 15 in tablet mode on a purple desk. Above it is a red beanie and to its right is a stylus. The screen displays a photo editing software. The carpet has a green square pattern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SMIBGTIXrjVmuSyRyUm5BmmEW-A=/0x0:8071x5381/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69004936/AMD_HP_ENVY_x360_15_NightfallBlack_5173_v06.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Envy x360 15 (AMD). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGhb6Y"&gt;HP has announced two new budget workstations for content creators: an Envy x360 15 and an Envy 17. The 15-inch convertible, starting at $749.99, is available with both AMD Ryzen 7 and Intel 11th Gen processors. The 17-inch clamshell starts at $999.99 and is Intel only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43AIh3"&gt;The Envy x360 comes in either “natural silver” or “nightfall black” and includes a magnetic active pen. Its bezels appear to have shrunk slightly since last year’s model. Models have an 88.7 percent screen-to-body ratio and weigh around four pounds. (Not that last year’s model had terrible bezels, but I’ll never say no to more screen real estate.) You can configure it with a 4K OLED display as well as an Nvidia MX450 graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOL0BS"&gt;The top Intel model will include a Core i7-1165G7, while AMD models go up to a Ryzen 7 5700U. I tested the former in last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, and it delivered a noticeable performance increase over its 10th Gen predecessor, particularly in integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Envy 17 on a desk, open. The screen displays a photo editing software. On its left is a camera and a bin of notebooks, on its right are a notebook, a pair of earbuds, and a lamp." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8aVJN_yPLUrQDbPaHcdCzxpXBFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383856/HP_ENVY_17_NaturalSilver_FPR_HD_Cam_Lifestyle.jpg_renamed_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Envy 17, in “natural silver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Glkqv"&gt;The larger Envy 17 has an 86.3 percent screen-to-body ratio and weighs just over 5.5 pounds (a bit less than last year’s model). It also comes with an MX450 and a 4K display (though there’s no OLED option). You can configure it with up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage and 32GB of memory. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Intel Envy x360 15 model in “natural silver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t7ZgxH"&gt;Both models have a 19 percent larger touchpad than their predecessors as well as a physical camera shutter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvfGja"&gt;In the past, I’ve been very impressed by the Envy line. Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt; was one of my favorite laptops of 2020 and my favorite under $1,000: it delivered a sturdy and attractive chassis, a great keyboard, strong performance, and all-day battery life. (Basically, I had very few complaints.) They tend to be good options for budget and midrange shoppers who are still looking for excellent specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZS9zUx"&gt;Last year’s Envy x360 15 offered great value for its price. At the $749.99 price point, this year’s base model (with a Ryzen 5 5500U) seems like it will be fairly competitive with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo’s Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt; (which starts at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FLenovo-Yoga-C740-14%2Fp%2F88YGC701292%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22340902%2Fhp-envy-x360-15-17-intel-amd-new-price-release-date-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$794.99&lt;/a&gt; for more storage but a weaker 10th Gen Intel processor). The Envy 17 is also competing on price with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS 17&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fxps-17-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-17-9700-laptop%23configurations_section&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22340902%2Fhp-envy-x360-15-17-intel-amd-new-price-release-date-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,000 more&lt;/a&gt; for comparable specs. I’ll have more information about how this device actually compares to those when I’ve gotten my hands on one myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mGRo9"&gt;All of the models are available for preorder now and will ship in April. The &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/DVVm3d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Envy x360 15 &lt;/a&gt;starts at $749.99, and the &lt;a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/LPP12M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Envy 17&lt;/a&gt; starts at $999.99. &lt;/p&gt;
