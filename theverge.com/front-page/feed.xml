    <title>Windows 11 is getting a new Task Manager design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-60_7eMujDpoL-DdFysOtrhvvY=/75x0:1455x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411262/unknown.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MaK7zh"&gt;Microsoft is getting ready to overhaul the Task Manager in Windows 11. Like the rest of the operating system, the Task Manager is getting a new design that matches Microsoft’s new Fluent Design language. It seems Microsoft hid the new design in the bowels of recent Windows 11 builds, but engineering student &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gus33000"&gt;Gustave Monce&lt;/a&gt;, who previously got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558999/microsoft-windows-11-windows-phone-port-developer-engineer"&gt;Windows 11 running on a phone&lt;/a&gt;, uncovered the work-in-progress and shared it on Discord this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s01iqn"&gt;It’s possible to enable the new Task Manager inside the latest preview builds of Windows 11, but Microsoft hasn’t officially announced the redesign. “This is a hidden feature in the new build,” says Monce. “Everything is broken though.” It’s clearly early days for this new design, but it already includes a dark mode and interface that closely matches the big design changes in Windows 11 — rounded corners, pastel shades, and a focus on simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yU42B"&gt;The tabs in the existing Task Manager have been replaced with a sidebar that allows you to switch between the various sections of the app. Task Manager is a big legacy part of Windows that originally debuted with Windows NT 4.0. It hasn’t had any significant changes for nearly 10 years after it was last overhauled in Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKHBhi"&gt;Microsoft is gradually redesigning most of the legacy parts of Windows. A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785617/microsoft-windows-11-media-player-app-audio-video-features"&gt;Media Player app is currently in testing&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows 11 is also getting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822651/microsoft-windows-11-notepad-redesign-find-replace-insider"&gt;redesigned Notepad app with dark mode support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are personally lobbying senators against antitrust legislation: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-APPLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgEeo5Gn3bN60msYwvZmF4lS3gk=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411252/1032853198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read NOAH BERGER/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wCISDb"&gt;The United States’ biggest tech companies are seriously worried about new antitrust legislation. So much so that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have been personally “calling and meeting with senators,” urging them to oppose the mooted legislation, according to a &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/punchbowl-news-am-1-18-22/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cites “​​multiple Senate aides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZJVRO"&gt;The legislation in question is &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The legislation is currently in its early stages, and is set to be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee today. The bill would need to pass votes from both the House and Senate to become law, but it’s still easy to see why it’s ruffling feathers with Silicon Valley’s biggest beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJSCyS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The legislation only affects the biggest US tech firms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NAJ6oL"&gt;The legislation prohibits online platforms from advantaging their own “products, services, or lines of business” over those of rivals. It applies only to the biggest tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, and Alphabet’s Google (though &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/u-s-antitrust-bill-expanded-to-include-tiktok-tencent-s-wechat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it will be expanded to cover Chinese tech giants TikTok and WeChat, too). These platforms would be barred from behavior like biasing search results in their favor, limiting rivals’ access to platform data, and using non-public data from customers to compete against them (activities that companies including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changed-search-algorithm-in-ways-that-boost-its-own-products-11568645345"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22544921/european-commission-google-antitrust-investigation-ad-tech-advertising-services"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are accused of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztjJyh"&gt;Although the exact impact of the legislation is difficult to predict, one aspect that worries Apple in particular is a possible threat to its App Store business model. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890100/antitrust-bill-apple-google-big-tech-senate"&gt;letter sent by the company&lt;/a&gt; to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Apple said that if the bill became law it would be forced to allow users to “sideload” apps onto iPhones and iPads as it does Macs — meaning installing them from sources outside the App Store. Apple says this threatens the security of its users by allowing unvetted apps onto devices, and cuts into one of its main revenue streams (Apple collects up to 30 percent commission on App Store sales). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EZF9j"&gt;In response to Apple’s arguments, a spokesperson for Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The bill does not force Apple to allow unscreened apps onto Apple devices. All of Apple’s arguments about ‘sideloading’ really amount to a desperate attempt to preserve their app store monopoly, which they use to charge huge fees from businesses they are competing against.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVoGXM"&gt;Although the Klobuchar-Grassley bill is roundly opposed by tech’s largest companies, smaller players have &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;come out in support of the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. A coalition of 35 tech firms recently wrote a letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee arguing that the legislation is necessary to curb “the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYvh3v"&gt;“For too long, dominant technology companies have made it difficult for other businesses to compete in the digital marketplace by abusing their gatekeeper status to give themselves and their partners preferential treatment and access on their platforms,” said the letter’s signatories, which include DuckDuckGo, Patreon, Sonos, Wyze, and Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYg3I5"&gt;It’s not the first time Big Tech’s top executives have personally mobilized against antitrust legislation. Last year, when US politicians were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;considering five new antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to “deliver a warning” against the impact of “rushed” legislation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony expects Microsoft to ‘continue to ensure’ Activision games stay multiplatform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWf_GnVfVC0jvnD9Lhs1RkS_JmU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411203/sonylogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Knv2ut"&gt;Sony has responded to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft’s blockbuster proposal to buy Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; with a comment on what that might mean for the future games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation consoles. “We expect that Microsoft will abide by contractual agreements and continue to ensure Activision games are multiplatform,” a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-expects-microsoft-to-keep-activision-games-multiplatform-11642665939"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izpw1z"&gt;That statement’s wording is less than definitive. It’s not surprising that Sony would expect Microsoft to honor any existing contractual agreements regarding PlayStation games, as it did when PS5 console exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; was released after Microsoft’s acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of publisher Bethesda Softworks. Once existing agreements expire, it opens the door for Microsoft to pursue Xbox exclusivity for the many franchises it’s acquiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gpCrQZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will Call of Duty be Xbox exclusive?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5OrIO"&gt;The big question is around &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. The franchise is hugely popular across both Xbox and PlayStation, but Sony has had a&lt;em&gt; Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; marketing deal in place with Activision for more than five years. “&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/15/8787135/call-of-duty-playstation-exclusive-deal-black-ops-3"&gt;PlayStation is the new home of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” declared former PlayStation CEO Andrew House during Sony’s E3 2015 press briefing. &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/11/12/playstation-5-turns-one-today/#sf251182436"&gt;Sony revealed&lt;/a&gt; in November that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War &lt;/em&gt;was the second most played PS5 game for the whole of 2021, behind only &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; also secured both of the top spots for US game sales for the whole of 2021, according to NPD, highlighting its impact on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EquwRS"&gt;Once Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal closes, Sony will be powerless over &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s long-term future on PlayStation. Microsoft’s Bethesda acquisition led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; becoming an Xbox and PC exclusive&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is hinting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783314/elder-scrolls-6-xbox-exclusive-pc-phil-spencer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;will also be an Xbox exclusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXstjT"&gt;“Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward,” said Spencer earlier this week. It’s easy to imagine a future where Microsoft maintains &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; across multiple platforms, but any future &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games go Xbox exclusive. After all, Microsoft isn’t spending $68.7 billion to keep publishing PlayStation games forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s EOS R5C is a 2-in-1 stills and cinema camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih2RQwKG-oLXLm4s2n_Z5DoRnWU=/0x0:1179x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411082/Canon_EOS_R5_C_with_BG_R10_battery_grip.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgcLTn"&gt;Canon has announced a new camera that brings cinema-grade video capabilities to a conventional full-frame mirrorless body. The EOS R5C looks a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;the EOS R5,&lt;/a&gt; which in turn looked a lot like a Canon DSLR, but it’s much bulkier in the back. This is to accommodate an active cooling system so it can shoot for long stretches without overheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjBjmj"&gt;How long? Well, Canon says the cooling system allows the R5C to shoot up to 8K/60fps indefinitely. This was an issue with the R5; it was advertised as being able to shoot 8K for about 20 minutes, and Canon later released a firmware update to improve overheating problems. The R5C also supports 8K HDR recording in HLG and PQ formats as well as 4K/120fps recording in 4:2:2 10-bit color without cropping the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRL4mdogITyRsxlg04sKVVhYIAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181655/Canon_EOS_R5_C_Stills_Video_Switch.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F6kSdk"&gt;As a stills camera, it’s essentially identical to the R5 except for the lack of in-body image stabilization. The full-frame sensor is 45 megapixels and you can shoot at 12fps with the mechanical shutter or 20fps with the electronic shutter. The camera’s three-way power switch lets you boot it up into photo or video modes, with the menus and button functionalities changing accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opDhtI"&gt;The EOS R5C will be released in March for $4,499. That’s $600 more expensive than the EOS R5, but then you’re almost getting another separate camera at the same time. For some creators and producers, the all-in-one convenience could be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku outage leads to frozen TVs and unresponsive devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCO9TkRmPGLT-UjRAOAvWXKew3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410747/DSCF3624_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YKOl6u"&gt;Roku experienced a significant service disruption on Wednesday evening, which resulted in some of the company’s streaming devices and even Roku TVs getting stuck on the loading screen or going through a reboot loop and becoming effectively useless. Roku TV sets from TCL, Hisense, and other manufacturers were affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve2Q4h"&gt;Users took to social media and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/"&gt;Roku’s subreddit&lt;/a&gt; to report problems with their Roku hardware, and &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/roku/"&gt;Down Detector showed a spike for Roku’s services&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s support account &lt;a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Playback-Issues-Audio-Video-Power/Service-Interruption-Activation-and-and-service-interruption/m-p/759715#M36686"&gt;acknowledged the ongoing issues at around 8:30PM ET.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8X1iJx"&gt;“Roku is aware of an issue reported by users who are unable to access some Roku services,” the company said. “If you are trying to activate your device, please try again later. Our priority is to get this resolved as soon as possible, and we ask that you bear with us as we manage this issue.” By late Wednesday night, the company’s services appeared to be operational again for those who had experienced the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3kmuZ"&gt;In a damning indictment of smart TVs, some customers had trouble using devices connected to the HDMI ports of their Roku TV, such as cable boxes or gaming consoles, during the service outage since the TVs were unable to activate after a factory reset.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hG04OW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Roku for more information on what went wrong. Not all customers were impacted by the service problems. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now save $20-$36 a year on YouTube Premium and Music Premium with new annual plans</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K8BTJH"&gt;If you’re a new or existing user of YouTube Premium and Music Premium, which let you watch and listen ad-free, you might be able to save up to $36 a year with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/11417260?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;oco=0"&gt;Google’s new annual plans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/18/youtube-premium-music-annual/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. From now until Sunday, January 23rd, users can receive an extra discount with the promo rate, but the new annual plans cost less than the current monthly rate either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlEdJC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium’s new annual plan&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling for $107.99, roughly $36 less than you’d pay for a year at its current monthly price of $143.88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf2PuU"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium/annual"&gt;YouTube Premium Music&lt;/a&gt; subscribers, the annual rate is currently $89.99, but will be priced at $119.88 after Sunday — still nearly a $30 savings over paying monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UrrVNQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"After years of false starts, YouTube is now serious about music streaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17391686/youtube-music-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JVhxao"&gt;Users are still able to sign-up for a month-to-month subscription, too — $11.99 for YouTube Premium and $9.99 for YouTube Music Premium, the same price as they were before. Both services offer a 7-day free trial period for new users before the user is charged for the full month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzCaAR"&gt;Though the annual subscription offers a one and done option for YouTube Music Premium users, it might not make sense if you’re grandfathered into an earlier, cheaper plan. You’d be paying 11 cents more for an annual plan if you’re currently paying $9.99 a month for YouTube Music, and it’s an even worse deal if you still have the old $7.99 plan, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdO524"&gt;With an annual plan, you have to pay for either service upfront, and YouTube says it won’t automatically renew at the end of one year. For existing subscribers, you may need to change your plan to qualify: It’s not available for those on family and student plans, and existing individual users on monthly subscriptions have to cancel their current plan before they can purchase the annual service. The plans are also only available in the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Germany, Thailand, India and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyGfbb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT meta-review: even desperate gamers should think twice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S8o9vWSs3oHgObLq32plMh6u-Fg=/0x0:1446x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410587/rx_6500_xt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nPHaQF"&gt;You’ve heard that PC graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22698588/falcodrin-gpu-hunters-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-tricks-bots-scalpers-miners-gamers"&gt;are nearly impossible to find&lt;/a&gt;, or that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;you’ll have to pay exorbitant sums&lt;/a&gt;. But if you were hoping the $200 budget AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT was about to change that, we have some very bad news. Reviewers are &lt;em&gt;positively ripping it a new one&lt;/em&gt;, and not just because of its cost, or the fact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891092/amd-4g-vram-claim-gpu-launch-rx-6500-xt"&gt;it only has 4GB of VRAM&lt;/a&gt; — but apparently because this brand-new GPU is laughably bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEyanU"&gt;“[T]his is the worst GPU release since I can remember, and I’ve been doing this job for over two decades,” &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/"&gt;writes &lt;em&gt;TechSpot’s&lt;/em&gt; Steven Walton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzKJD8"&gt;“AMD RX 6500 XT is worse than 2016’s GPUs,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFpuJqx9Qmw&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;declares &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jLfKH"&gt;“WTF AMD!?” and “WTF is AMD thinking?,” ask &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArW4-mkGHSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hardware Canucks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmE8iZWaLWE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuruTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; respectively. “A GPU you might be able to buy... but shouldn’t,” writes &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYp6pEDm4E8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linus Tech Tips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Worst GPU,” declares &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5_oM3Ow_CI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DJ21h"&gt;“Gigabyte’s RX 6500 XT Gaming OC card gives us our first bitter taste of what a ‘budget’ GPU means in 2022,” writes &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-benchmarks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, adding “as a modern graphics card it looks like pretty weak sauce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD05Sv"&gt;“The year 2022 just started, and this potentially looks to be the most insufficient graphics card series of the year,” concludes &lt;a href="https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/radeon_rx_6500_xt_review,28.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guru3D&lt;/em&gt;’s Hilbert Hagedoorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZihzB"&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever seen a graphics card dragged this hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PI0PZI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Radeon RX 6500 XT really shows the world everything that’s wrong with the current state of the GPU market” — Tom’s Hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehccNL"&gt;Even relatively respectful outlets offer few compliments, with &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605952/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-affordable-graphics-cards-are-back.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld&lt;/em&gt;’s Brad Chacos suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that AMD may be able to tap “an unserved market” if it can actually hit $199 and calling it “a capable budget option” for medium to high settings at 1080p. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-xfx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; thinks&lt;/a&gt; $199 is optimistic, though. “At least buying an RX 6500 XT guarantees you’re getting a brand-new card, which can’t be said for the various used GPUs being sold on eBay and other second-hand markets,” writes Jarred Walton, damning with faint praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMexno"&gt;According to reviewers, the problem is multifaceted but fairly simple to sum up: AMD cut serious corners on a GPU while also failing to improve performance. They point out that performance is roughly equivalent to the card’s direct predecessor, the RX 5500 XT — a card that came out two years ago, &lt;em&gt;for less money, &lt;/em&gt;with more video outputs. (Here, you only only get one HDMI and one DisplayPort.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKdg4I"&gt;And if you look further back, like &lt;em&gt;Gamers Nexus&lt;/em&gt; and others did, you might notice performance hasn’t meaningfully improved over AMD’s RX 580 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060 — mid-range cards from 2017 and 2016 respectively. (The RX 580 seems to beat it in some of the benchmarks I’m seeing — if AMD sometimes loses to a five-year-old card that originally retailed for $229, that seems bad, no?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y77WxI"&gt;But it gets even worse if you’ve got an older PCIe 3.0 motherboard, some point out, because AMD reportedly decided to limit the card’s bandwidth to 4x, instead of the full 16 lanes of bandwidth, when it’s plugged into a PCIe 3.0 slot. &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/"&gt;Here’s TechSpot again&lt;/a&gt;, talking about testing &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; using one of those older boards: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mQkgAC"&gt;The average frame rate also fell by 28% and this saw the 6500 XT go from 65 fps to just 47 fps. It also meant although it was able to match the &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1961-radeon-rx-5500-4gb-vs-8gb/"&gt;5500 XT&lt;/a&gt; when using PCIe 4.0, when installed in a PCIe 3.0 system you’re looking more at base GTX 1650 performance, which is worse than the &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/1411-radeon-rx-570-vs-geforce-gtx-1060-3gb/"&gt;RX 570&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N7kGgn"&gt;Here are some other choice quotes from reviewers attempting to find a silver lining in the RX 6500 XT (power consumption seems to be a bright spot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m32jHD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-xfx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tSEIwR"&gt;Of the six games with ray tracing that we tested — and admittedly, we used more demanding RT games, as otherwise the effects are largely wasted — only one qualified as even remotely playable: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. And even it wasn’t without trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OZQtF4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605952/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review-affordable-graphics-cards-are-back.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCWorld&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AUJnro"&gt;But the modest GPU and bizarre memory configuration mean you’ll need to be careful about the settings you use. If you crank visuals up to ultra or run into a game with especially high memory demands, the limited memory capacity and bus width could result in jarring frame-time spikes when your PC exceeds the 4GB barrier and needs to tap into your system’s general RAM pool for help. Don’t push this GPU harder than it’s intended for and you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6RyCSK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-review?page=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HotHardware:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yCCv3v"&gt;The new Radeon RX 6500 XT is one of the more power-friendly GPUs of the bunch. Despite offering much better performance (more often than not) then the GeForce GTX 1650, the 6500 XT consumes only slightly more power. In comparison to the Radeon RX 5500 XT and Radeon RX 570, however, the new 6500 XT uses significantly less power when under load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e1ltnQ"&gt;Maybe sit out this one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to clean your $19 Apple cleaning cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OUWNdpAMJQaWMPg0BN1He4njZkE=/143x0:1859x1144/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410545/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t just throw it in the wash.&lt;/em&gt; | Image of cloth: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fkw4NC"&gt;Here’s the scenario: you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;managed to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s hottest product, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;$19 polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt; meant for cleaning nano-texture screens and other Apple devices. But oh no! Instead of hanging it up with the rest of your priceless artifacts, you accidentally used it to actually clean something, and now it’s &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfully, Apple has bestowed us with a guide on how to make our cloth good as new, and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/19/apple-explains-how-to-clean-its-polishing-cloth-without-buying-a-new-polishing-cloth/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; has brought those instructions to our attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="howto-title"&gt;Are you ready? Here’s how Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210229"&gt;“How to clean the nano-texture glass on your Apple display” support article&lt;/a&gt; describes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p6tXWq"&gt;1. Hand wash the polishing cloth with dish soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxbtus"&gt;2. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJZx08"&gt;3. Allow the polishing cloth to air dry for at least 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vuuGd8"&gt;The instructions have been on Apple’s website for at least a few months, according to the WayBack Machine, but despite a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-polishing-cloth"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/26/apples-cleaning-cloth-is-sold-out-through-january----get-this-instead"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; mentioning them, I hadn’t come across them. That’s really a shame — other people who also hadn’t known about the instructions might’ve been throwing away their priceless polishers all because of a little grime, wasting $20 simply because the cleaning instructions are buried on a support page instead of being included on a tag, or embossed on the cloth itself. (I would also settle for prime placement on the Apple home page, where all people of the cloth spend their day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0Mv0"&gt;The instructions themselves are also a little disappointing — ultimately, Apple is telling us to wash the cloth like we would any other delicate fabric. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;At least it’s back in stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2022 won’t stream in 4K on NBC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hollywood Exteriors And Landmarks - 2022" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axVrAuCls7r8ogh3DIuWRNr4cxA=/0x74:3100x2141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410509/1237814418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXemvT"&gt;The 2022 Super Bowl won’t be broadcast or streamed in 4K again this year when the game takes place on February 13th, NBC Sports has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The lack of a 4K stream marks the second year in a row that the big game won’t be available with the higher level of picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcHBIK"&gt;“The game will not be in 4K,” Dan Masonson, a spokesperson for NBC Sports, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erBWxf"&gt;NBC, which is hosting the big game this year, has never actually aired an NFL game in 4K or HDR before, despite hosting the nationally televised Sunday Night Football game every week during the regular NFL season. NBC, for what it's worth, isn’t the only network: CBS doesn’t produce any of its games in 4K (the network cited COVID-19 issues for the lack of a 4K Super Bowl in 2021), nor does ESPN with Monday Night Football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ5zep"&gt;Fox Sports started broadcasting some of its Thursday Night Football games in 4K in 2019, and three seasons later is still the only broadcaster to offer NFL games 4K/HDR quality. And even that has limitations: Fox only does it for select Thursday night games — and Super Bowl 2020, the only Super Bowl to date that has been broadcast in 4K — and its footage is actually shot in 1080p and HDR, then upscaled to 4K for broadcast, rather than true, native 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOvnAG"&gt;Still, there was some hope that NBC would manage to pull off Super Bowl LVI in 4K, given that the network has started to slowly expand its 4K sport offers. Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/4k"&gt;Tokyo Olympics&lt;/a&gt; had an (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22589928/peacock-2020-olympics-streaming"&gt;extremely messy&lt;/a&gt;) slate of 4K programming, and the network has already announced plans to air large portions of the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in 4K, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSKi0v"&gt;Part of the problem is that NBC still doesn’t have a 4K distribution method for the vast majority of fans; last year’s Olympic broadcasts &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; in 4K and HDR (some events event had Dolby Atmos), but the 4K programming wasn’t actually available in any of NBC’s apps (including the regular NBC app, the NBC Sports app, and &lt;a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/828265/11640?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2Fcan-i-watch-content-in-4k-on-peacock&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;). Rather, the 4K broadcasts were limited to partners like Altice, Xfinity, Fubo TV, YouTube TV, DIRECTV, Dish, and other cable and over-the-top service with 4K support. And even then, coverage was limited to specific events at specific times in specific TV markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNOUop"&gt;Plus, as the lone 4K Super Bowl in 2020 showed, actually airing one of the biggest sports games of the year to the millions of fans who tune in is a huge undertaking: there’s the dozens of cameras and slow-motion shots for instant replays, the graphics packages, and of course, the halftime show and the slew of commercials, all of which need to be turned into a cohesive, 4K and HDR package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKkf0k"&gt;There is some good news on the horizon for football fans, though: 2023’s Super Bowl LVII is set to be broadcast on Fox, which could potentially return us to a 4K game day — if we’re lucky!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now make a Playdate game right in your browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ao0U4DPihic4AGFRdP2qkyjC7M=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410503/FJe_bFrVUAEqToY__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playdate Pulp is in public beta.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Playdate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0QXYO"&gt;Panic, the maker of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;quirky Playdate handheld&lt;/a&gt;, has released a public beta of its &lt;a href="http://play.date/pulp"&gt;Playdate Pulp in-browser game builder&lt;/a&gt;. The company describes it as “a friendly tool for making tiny but visually and narratively rich games for Playdate,” &lt;a href="https://play.date/pulp/docs/"&gt;in its developer documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylH5GS"&gt;In the Pulp editor, you’ll be able to do things like make pixel graphics, build levels, write music, and even create custom fonts. As you’re working on your game, you can test it right in your browser, and when you’re ready, you can export your game as a .pdx file (a clever reference to Panic’s Portland roots) so you can load it onto a Playdate handheld. You don’t have to write any code to make a game in Pulp, but if you do want to try your hand at some coding, you can use the &lt;a href="https://play.date/pulp/docs/pulpscript/"&gt;PulpScript scripting language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Playdate Pulp is now available in public beta!! Pulp is a super fun (and free!) game making tool for Playdate. With a few clicks, anyone can turn a game idea into Playdate reality. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cWPGcxFDhi"&gt;https://t.co/cWPGcxFDhi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/C1qtbJpgGd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C1qtbJpgGd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Playdate (@playdate) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1483905526652026886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="ZgjIM1"&gt;I’m no game developer, but Pulp seems relatively easy to use in my few minutes of messing around with it. I already figured out how to turn the player sprite in the default game Pulp loads with into a big letter J, which of course will be totally necessary for my future masterpiece. I’m really looking forward to seeing what people cook up with the tool once they spend some time with it, and have my fingers crossed for some off-the-wall, &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;-style games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPQ33v"&gt;Releasing the public beta of Pulp now could also mean that the Playdate will have a bunch of fun games for people to try when the device comes out. Panic has so far only announced one curated season with 24 games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609923/playdate-handheld-crank-panic-game-season-one"&gt;and you’ll only get two new games per week&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Pulp, though, you might have a lot of other games to choose from that you can side-load onto your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeGocZ"&gt;Panic says it expects to deliver its first shipments of the Playdate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776649/panic-playdate-delay-2022-handheld-battery-chip-shortage"&gt;in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. You can still pre-order the device, though Panic cautions on &lt;a href="https://shop.play.date/"&gt;its Playdate store page&lt;/a&gt; that pre-orders placed now won’t ship until late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
