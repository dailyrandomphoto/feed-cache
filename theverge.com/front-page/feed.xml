    <title>Four years later, we are all BBC Dad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bbc-dad" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7MqC6B5cOwCis4zqXfPgpXrEaho=/0x0:771x514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949809/personal_space_bbc_dad_kids_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WNT1VP"&gt;Four years ago yesterday, a meme was born: professor Robert Kelly, who will be forever known as “BBC Dad,” had &lt;em&gt;the gall&lt;/em&gt; to get interrupted by his kids during a live video interview &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/10/asia/bbc-interview-robert-kelly-children-trnd/"&gt;broadcast around the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WNrSuM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you aren’t feeling old yet, here’s the daughter in that video above &lt;a href="https://t.co/meL81Rd0fM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/meL81Rd0fM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Lewis_/status/1369628467394936832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T20iXn"&gt;I remember thinking: isn’t this just a cute video? Why would anyone drag him for working at home? But of course I’d see things that way, seeing how I’ve spent most of the past decade working from a home office myself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCOsMq"&gt;Initially, BBC Dad had to &lt;em&gt;own it&lt;/em&gt;. He had to lean into the meme, making his kids part of his public persona and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195340/bbc-dad-work-from-home-calls-south-korea"&gt;even featuring them in later interviews&lt;/a&gt;. Even today, he’s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; trying to explain that yes, he WAS wearing pants at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qlctIs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;like this. It is genuinely the comedy of errors you see in the vid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. You didn't stand up to usher out your kids, bc you weren't wearing pants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no dignity left ‍♂️. I remained seated, bc the show must go on. I'd done enough TV by then to know that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pic: James at Xmas &lt;a href="https://t.co/gUOXL04p9h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gUOXL04p9h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Robert E Kelly (@Robert_E_Kelly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Robert_E_Kelly/status/1369804666771447809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66qqfx"&gt;The kids-interrupting-the-call part, though? Not so much. Everyone understands that now. You or someone in your family or circle of friends has &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; BBC Dad, making some hilarious gaff in a work call, counting yourselves lucky &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;your upside-down floating head&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;deep-seated-desire to become a cat&lt;/a&gt; didn’t get shared with the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93smHy"&gt;We’ve lost an awful lot in the COVID-19 pandemic, but one incredibly tiny silver lining is that remote work is better understood now. I don’t need to explain to anyone that my desk is my office, or that kids will magically phase in and out of my video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvqtQv"&gt;Okay, that felt a little somber. Let’s end on a brighter note! &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/06/can-i-have-two-biscuits-the-best-of-kids-interrupting-television-interviews"&gt;Here are more children interrupting live video interviews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Hyundai Staria is the coolest-looking minivan in years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLs-jPQto9v5om6r10Dr7Hm9qVo=/403x614:3775x2862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949721/_Photo_3__STARIA_Premium_EXT.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Hyundai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqvMus"&gt;Minivans are &lt;a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2020/02/minivan-market-share-is-now-at-2-percent-in-america-and-its-rapidly-getting-worse/"&gt;pretty much dead&lt;/a&gt; in the US, but Hyundai’s new Staria looks so slick that it makes me believe there could be a revival some day soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvUhhQ"&gt;Revealed &lt;a href="https://news.hyundaimotorgroup.com/MediaCenter/News/Press-Releases/Hyundai-Motor-Offers-First-Peek-at-STARIA-New-MPV-with-Premium-and-Futuristic-Design-#none"&gt;in teaser images on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, the Staria is easily the coolest-looking minivan since the spaceship-styled ones that prevailed in the 1980s. In fact, Hyundai describes the Staria’s exterior as “strikingly futuristic and mysterious ... resembling a spaceship” in the press release, so maybe this is just my personal preference for this style showing. But whether or not you like it, the Staria is certainly one of the most mold-breaking vans that we’ve seen in a long time — especially considering that modern minivans have basically mutated into &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-kia-carnival-first-look-review/"&gt;really large SUVs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyAbdS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10386691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiIh1e"&gt;Hyundai hasn’t provided dimensions, but the Staria is nothing like that. Its stubby nose and exterior proportions seem to more closely resemble the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/06/the-nissan-van-taxi-that-will-rule-nycs-streets-is-actually-great/"&gt;Nissan vans that make up part of New York City’s yellow taxi fleet&lt;/a&gt; or a small delivery van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zy7gYE"&gt;But Hyundai has taken that basic shape and given it a retro-futuristic spin that clearly tracks with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;new design language it’s been developing for cars like the forthcoming Ioniq 5 EV&lt;/a&gt;. The interior also looks pleasantly roomy, with big windows and a panoramic windshield that stretches up above the driver’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="font-size"&gt;Hyundai hasn’t said whether the Staria will be electric, or where it will be sold. (More details are expected “in the coming weeks.”) I wouldn’t exactly bet money on the former being true, and given the sad state of minivan sales in the US, it’s not hard to imagine Hyundai being cautious about bringing the Staria here regardless of its powertrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fsMw7"&gt;But one thing’s for sure: Hyundai Motor Group’s designers are pushing the look of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323438/kia-ev6-electric-car-hyundai-apple-platform"&gt;company’s new vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in really daring ways, and the Staria is the latest example. Now if the company could only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;get a handle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/03/09/kia-recall-optima-soul-forte-sorento/4642536001/"&gt;quality assurance&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bumble’s new Night In feature is an attempt to break the ice on virtual dates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aMPb9_kf2lvnrCdwWybYJgsQmKM=/113x0:1807x1129/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949238/Night_In_Press_w_logo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bumble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWxfjD"&gt;Dating app Bumble has announced Night In, a new feature that lets you play games on a virtual date. The feature is available to users in the US and Canada, and the game available at launch is a series of trivia questions you can answer together. However, Bumble says it plans to offer more games and virtual experiences in the “near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USOJAz"&gt;Night In is an expansion of Bumble’s existing video dates feature, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19121374/bumble-dating-app-video-voice-chat-call-first-date"&gt;launched back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The feature has seen a marked increase in demand as a result of the pandemic; Bumble says its voice and video calling features were used 70 percent more after the pandemic started. Hopefully, being able to play a game will act as a nice icebreaker and help mitigate some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;more awkward elements of virtual dates&lt;/a&gt;, even if they’ll never match the intimacy of being in the same room as another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9mF730"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bumble added video dates in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8MiuN"&gt;Bumble’s Night In can be organized using the icon in a chat message. The virtual date can be scheduled ahead of time for between 6PM and midnight on any day of the week. Once scheduled, both participants will be sent reminders and notifications by the app ahead of the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZlxYM"&gt;Bumble’s video chat features were in place before the pandemic, but other dating apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316317/tinder-face-to-face-rollout-video-calls"&gt;Tinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21209801/hinge-video-call-chat-date-from-home-feature-launch"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt; have had to rush to catch up over the past year. Although the introduction of these features was undoubtedly influenced by the pandemic, it sounds like they might live on after this current era of social distancing. In a recent survey, Bumble says almost half of respondents in the US said they preferred a first date to be virtual rather than in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqj0KM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvQUYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will soon let you draw on a map to fix it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3m6HgJn1optvQNEvBo0G239qLD4=/349x33:2880x1720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949184/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_4.14.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFgh7D"&gt;If you’ve ever been frustrated by a road simply &lt;em&gt;not existing&lt;/em&gt; on Google Maps, the company’s now making it easier than ever to add it. Google will be updating its map editing experience to allow users to add missing roads and realign, rename or delete incorrect ones. It calls the experience “drawing,” but it’s closer to using the line tool in Microsoft Paint. The updated tool should be “rolling out over the coming months in more than 80 countries,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/three-new-ways-anyone-can-update-google-maps/?_ga=2.110865477.1901867856.1615485216-809046695.1615485216"&gt;according to a blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYTXZ9"&gt;Currently, if you try to add a missing road, you can only drop a pin where the road should be and type in the road’s name to submit that information to Google. The new tool should make it easier to not only add missing roads, but to make corrections such as fixing a road’s name or its direction (for example, if the road is one-way but Google Maps says it isn’t).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eiqj_-8RcexSEqLoJYwumqUF1y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361266/Google_Map_edit.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new map editor lets users visually add in missing roads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvcz9706AtSAqAifoTJUNShJvzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361359/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_4.03.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current correction screen is more rudimentary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GP5pNI"&gt;Of course, Google will still be vetting your corrections to make sure they’re accurate. After you submit a change with the new tool, you’ll see a screen where Google warns that it doesn’t want a bike path to be marked as a road, or for someone to make a road intended to hurt people, for example. That screen also says that it’ll take about seven days for the company to review your submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfd5n"&gt;Google Maps will also be getting a feature called “photo updates” which will let you share small details about a place without having to leave a full review. In the app, you’ll be able add images of a location as well as see recent photos with text snippets others have submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUCJ34xkgfJ6ORb1AcAYh_Rwnfs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361222/Photo_Updates_Hero_Image___Updates_Tab.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updates should help surface the most recent information about a location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MNygFL"&gt;General Motors announced a new joint venture with SolidEnergy Systems, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is focused on improving the energy density in lithium-ion batteries. The two companies plan on building a test facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, for a high-capacity preproduction battery by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oiE7Y"&gt;The partnership was announced Thursday by GM president Mark Reuss at a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post Live&lt;/em&gt; virtual conference. Prior to the announcement, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Kent Helfrich, executive director of GM’s global electrification and battery systems, about what the joint venture will mean for the automaker’s plans to electrify its entire fleet of vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wgwRqG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1LlWWx"&gt;“In the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost,” Helfrich said. “And it’ll also mean most likely smaller batteries, so a lighter weight vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hbuEb"&gt;When GM first unveiled its modular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium battery platform&lt;/a&gt; last year, it said the new energy system would enable electric vehicles that could travel “400 miles or more” on a single charge. Last November, the automaker increased the estimated maximum range to 450 miles. The first vehicle to be built with an Ultium battery will be the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, which the company says will have an estimated 350 miles of range. The Hummer is expected to go into production at the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu7dBt"&gt;The company is sticking with its estimate of 450 miles of range for now, declining to speculate as to how many more miles it anticipates adding through its battery venture with SolidEnergy Systems. That company has been focused on improving the energy density in li-ion batteries for nearly a decade. According to MIT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cSXyDW"&gt;Founded in 2012 by MIT alumnus and former postdoc Qichao Hu ’07, SolidEnergy Systems has developed an “anode-free” lithium metal battery with several material advances that make it twice as energy-dense, yet just as safe and long-lasting as the lithium ion batteries used in smartphones, electric cars, wearables, drones, and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="W1yPLC"&gt;GM is interested in the company’s intellectual property, which includes the manufacturing process for lithium metal anodes and electrolytes to improve the battery’s overall life cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A8Eqle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Anode-free” lithium metal battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ITodtK"&gt;Despite its name, SolidEnergy still works with liquid electrolytes and does not consider itself a “solid-state” battery company. Solid-state systems have been the subject of intense focus from the auto industry in recent years, as companies seek to develop EV batteries that will charge faster, hold more power, and last longer than traditional EV batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKeT8o"&gt;While the focus of this joint venture with SolidEnergy is the production of “wet” li-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes, GM is looking closely at solid-state technology for the future. “Is our advanced team also looking at solid state type technology? Absolutely,” Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology, said. “We wouldn’t leave anything off the table at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gwu9SE"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-batteries/gm-says-it-is-almost-there-on-million-mile-electric-vehicle-battery-idUSKBN22V2FS"&gt;a top GM official said&lt;/a&gt; the company was “almost there” on developing an electric vehicle battery that will last 1 million miles. Speaking to a group of investors, GM executive VP Doug Parks wouldn’t specify a timeline, but said “multiple teams” at the automaker are working on such advances as zero-cobalt electrodes, solid-state batteries, and ultra-fast charging. Typical EV batteries today last up to 100,000 to 200,000 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JtHD"&gt;GM has been an investor in SolidEnergy Systems since 2015 through its venture capital arm, but it isn’t the only battery startup to attract the automaker’s interest. In 2010, GM invested &lt;a href="https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/g-m-ventures-invests-3-2-million-in-battery-company/"&gt;$3.2 million in a Michigan-based company called Sakti3&lt;/a&gt; that was working on solid-state batteries. The automaker is also in talks to construct a second massive battery factory in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhOLVD"&gt;But GM isn’t the only company to view advances in EV batteries as a way to accelerate the future in which zero-emission vehicles replace all of the gas-guzzling cars on the road today. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla announced&lt;/a&gt; its own plan to take more control over its battery-making process. And next week, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/09/vw-tesla-like-battery-day-produce-cells-spain/"&gt;Volkswagen will unveil its own vision&lt;/a&gt; for EV batteries during its virtual “Power Day” event. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story on how Facebook’s focus on growth stopped its AI team from fighting misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISLUwsBpJSPwzNeuULDvD_FjH2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949135/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQpWBY"&gt;Facebook has always been a company focused on growth above all else. More users and more engagement equals more revenue. The cost of that single-mindedness is spelled out clearly in &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;this brilliant story from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It details how attempts to tackle misinformation by the company’s AI team using machine learning were apparently stymied by Facebook’s unwillingness to limit user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1LTzI"&gt;“If a model reduces engagement too much, it’s discarded. Otherwise, it’s deployed and continually monitored,” writes author Karen Hao of Facebook’s machine learning models. “But this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DI9Ty"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ibchUl"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_KarenHao/status/1370008460918743045"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Hao noted that the article is not about “corrupt people [doing] corrupt things.” Instead, she says, “It’s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing. But they’re trapped in a rotten system, trying their best to push the status quo that won’t budge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOURCQ"&gt;The story also adds more evidence to the accusation that Facebook’s desire to placate conservatives during Donald Trump’s presidency led to it turning a blind eye to right-wing misinformation. This seems to have happened at least in part due to the influence of Joel Kaplan, a former member of George W. Bush’s administration who is now Facebook’s vice president of global public policy and “its highest-ranking Republican.” As Hao writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tCJ6qq"&gt;All Facebook users have some 200 “traits” attached to their profile. These include various dimensions submitted by users or estimated by machine-learning models, such as race, political and religious leanings, socioeconomic class, and level of education. Kaplan’s team began using the traits to assemble custom user segments that reflected largely conservative interests: users who engaged with conservative content, groups, and pages, for example. Then they’d run special analyses to see how content-moderation decisions would affect posts from those segments, according to a former researcher whose work was subject to those reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYL5Hb"&gt;The Fairness Flow documentation, which the Responsible AI team wrote later, includes a case study on how to use the tool in such a situation. When deciding whether a misinformation model is fair with respect to political ideology, the team wrote, “fairness” does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean the model should affect conservative and liberal users equally. If conservatives are posting a greater fraction of misinformation, as judged by public consensus, then the model should flag a greater fraction of conservative content. If liberals are posting more misinformation, it should flag their content more often too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yQK6y"&gt;But members of Kaplan’s team followed exactly the opposite approach: they took “fairness” to mean that these models should not affect conservatives more than liberals. When a model did so, they would stop its deployment and demand a change. Once, they blocked a medical-misinformation detector that had noticeably reduced the reach of anti-vaccine campaigns, the former researcher told me. They told the researchers that the model could not be deployed until the team fixed this discrepancy. But that effectively made the model meaningless. “There’s no point, then,” the researcher says. A model modified in that way “would have literally no impact on the actual problem” of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjb9kb"&gt;The story also says that the work by Facebook’s AI researchers on the problem of algorithmic bias, in which machine learning models unintentionally discriminate against certain groups of users, has been undertaken, at least in part to preempt these same accusations of anti-conservative sentiment and forestall potential regulation by the US government. But pouring more resources into bias has meant ignoring problems involving misinformation and hate speech. Despite the company’s lip service to AI fairness, the guiding principle, says Hao, is still the same as ever: growth, growth, growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MTBQnQ"&gt;[T]esting algorithms for fairness is still largely optional at Facebook. None of the teams that work directly on Facebook’s news feed, ad service, or other products are required to do it. Pay incentives are still tied to engagement and growth metrics. And while there are guidelines about which fairness definition to use in any given situation, they aren’t enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qSYdPq"&gt;You can read Hao’s full story at &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Soon you’ll be able to buy a one-foot-tall figurine of ChilledCow’s lo-fi chill beats anime girl</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxUfn7EGMDU717v3Tygsh2d4J9w=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949041/youtooz_lofi_hip_hop_radio_beats_to_relax_study_to_girl_1_ft_figure_release_info_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Youtooz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo5o6O"&gt;Jesus. Okay. Look, I like capitalism as much as the next schmuck who blogs for a living, but what is going on right now with regard to the efficient allocation of the Earth’s precious resources?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1bFKK"&gt;Let me paint a word picture for you. Youtooz, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262329/stonks-vinyl-figurine-gamestop-dogecoin-reddit"&gt;the company that made a stonks guy figurine&lt;/a&gt;, has now created a one-foot-tall version of the lo-fi chill beats anime girl, complete with desk and study materials. You know her; she’s always studying while you’re listening to said beats. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2F2021%2F3%2Fyoutooz-lofi-hip-hop-radio-beats-to-relax-study-to-girl-1-ft-figure-release-info&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325348%2Fyoutooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypebeast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the figurine drops for public consumption on April 2nd at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dpWHF"&gt;In theory, I like whatever’s going on here. Before it became something of a meme, lo-fi chill anime beats to work and study to was an inaccurate description of the post-Nujabes diaspora — you know, the stuff that Jun Seba did on &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo Music Record: Departure&lt;/em&gt;, the soundtrack to Shinichirō Watanabe’s brilliant anime. Whatever happened between 2004 (when the TV show and the record were released) and now must have been pretty traumatic; the sound wended its way through innumerable producers and turned into something like Muzak — &lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/28274/muzak-history-background-story-background-music"&gt;music to be productive to&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5pNDT"&gt;Anyway, we’re in the deep end now. Over on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;ChilledCow&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most recognizable channel for lo-fi goodness, streaming as they do to tens of thousands of listeners at any given minute on any given day. And yes, Youtooz’s figurine is a replica of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; perpetually studying anime girl. It looks cool; she has a backpack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMOpdN"&gt;But that still doesn’t answer my question. I guess it doesn’t matter? I do love the statuette, but I’m not sure it needs to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Najtpq"&gt;Whatever. Do Canti from &lt;em&gt;FLCL&lt;/em&gt; next, cowards. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taser maker Axon teams up with Skydio to sell drones directly to cops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YlTIIslun73Iygb2cv7xvC1aEPs=/250x0:1750x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948975/Skydio_X2_commercial_drone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Skydio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xayVO3"&gt;Axon — the law enforcement company that makes Tasers, police body cameras, and other police and military technologies — has announced a new partnership with US drone company Skydio. Through the new deal, Axon will become the exclusive provider of Skydio’s drones (like the Skydio 2 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"&gt;X2&lt;/a&gt;) to law enforcement and police agencies, while Skydio will be able to offer Axon’s drone-based software tools, &lt;a href="https://www.axon.com/products/axon-evidence"&gt;like Axon Evidence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.axon.com/products/respond"&gt;Axon Respond&lt;/a&gt; on its drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBcczl"&gt;Both tools are largely observational in nature, so they wouldn’t be turning the drones into weapons. Axon Evidence is used to compile footage, similar to how Axon’s existing body cameras work, so that the drones can offer additional perspectives on a situation. Axon itself explicitly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761084/axon-taser-facial-recognition-ban-ethics-board-recommendation"&gt;announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that it won’t be “commercializing face matching products.” Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21323448/skydio-x2-consumer-military-enterprise-ceo-adam-bry"&gt;Skydio’s CEO has previously&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it won’t be weaponizing its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rakNJM"&gt;Skydio itself already sells drones to police departments, too — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22156987/go-read-this-police-drones-skydio-dji-privacy"&gt;Chula Vista, California police department&lt;/a&gt; is already a customer, for example, complete with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;limited FAA approval&lt;/a&gt; to use those drones beyond visual line of sight in emergency situations. But the Axon deal opens the door to make it much easier for departments to buy Skydio’s products in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l0IbCy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Autonomous drone maker Skydio shifts to military and enterprise with its first folding drone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MGr4B3"&gt;The Skydio deal isn’t Axon’s first drone partnership; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17429908/dji-axon-air-taser-drones-police-officers-program-sale"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it launched its “&lt;a href="https://global.axon.com/products/air"&gt;Axon Air&lt;/a&gt;” program in partnership with DJI, offering Axon software on DJI drones sold directly by Axon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX4h9o"&gt;But in the years since, DJI’s Chinese ties have effectively sidelined it from US government work. DJI is headquartered in Shenzhen and its drones are largely made in China with Chinese parts, leading some officials to worry that DJI drones could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack by the Chinese government. The Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded its DJI fleet&lt;/a&gt; in October 2019 over security concerns from spying or cyberattacks. The Department of Justice banned the purchase of foreign-made drones &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/520269-justice-department-issues-policy-banning-use-of-grant-funds-for-certain"&gt;with agency funds last October&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;Department of Defense’s list of approved drones&lt;/a&gt; only includes products from Skydio, Parrot, and Vantage, with DJI notably absent from the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIYuQD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;DJI was also recently added&lt;/a&gt; to the US Department of Commerce’s Entity List, which aimed to sanction DJI for enabling “wide-scale human rights abuses within China,” when the &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2F2020-03-26%2Fdji-s-drone-supremacy-comes-at-a-price%3Fsrnd%3Deconomics-vp%26sref%3DExbtjcSG&amp;amp;a=1722098870466579501&amp;amp;uuid=0129be77-04d4-4fff-93e3-0a2eea64f11f&amp;amp;uid_bam=1720778310608519800&amp;amp;ar=1726904878611144427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company provided drones&lt;/a&gt; to the Chinese government to surveil detention camps in the Xinjiang province. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5S24DB"&gt;And while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22193660/us-government-dji-drone-entity-list-export-ban-effects"&gt;DJI is still able to sell its drones&lt;/a&gt; in the US to consumers, Skydio in particular has already managed to capitalize on the government’s blacklist of Chinese drone companies, and it recently became the first US drone company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded"&gt;to reach a $1 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGzJH"&gt;Skydio CEO Adam Bry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21323448/skydio-x2-consumer-military-enterprise-ceo-adam-bry"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that it still intends to stay in the consumer drone business and that it won’t be arming its drones. “We have more products coming in that market that we’re excited about,” said Bry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQFi9l"&gt;But government and military deals are unquestionably a big part of Skydio’s plans.

    <title>Anker’s Liberty Air 2 Pro pair good noise cancellation with a low price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;And they have a surprisingly great app&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="7fJcCf"&gt;It is increasingly hard to stand out in the wireless earbud market. You can find a pair of earbuds at nearly every price point with a range of different features sprinkled throughout. Being within a particular ecosystem, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; for iOS users or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; for Samsung’s users, is an easy way to choose earbuds that are right for you. Anker doesn’t exactly have a phone of its own to sell alongside its Liberty line of earbuds, so its strategy is to deliver desirable features at a competitive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4Ac12"&gt;The $129.99 Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro buds do a lot of things well, but so do a lot of other earbuds at this price. It’s their competitive active noise cancellation and well-designed app that helps them stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="feEcgh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10384906"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5G7GX"&gt;The buds themselves are the same stemmed design with a silicone ear tip as Apple’s AirPods Pro. (I guess the name isn’t the only way Anker took inspiration from Apple.) The Liberty Air 2 Pro have a gold fan-like cover over their speakers, which serves no purpose other than looking cool, and a textured, matte finish. They come in “onyx black,” “titanium white,” “sapphire blue,” and “crystal pink.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Included in the box are nine different-sized silicone ear tips, ranging from XXXS to XL, to create the best seal and hopefully keep movement in your ear canal from happening.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QTMx4yAhUIVNaIOUtXxWNLXVPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360983/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro come in black, white, blue, and pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xhzWgb"&gt;Fit is extremely important in earbuds, not only for ANC but also for the best sound quality experience, especially in the lower frequencies. To confirm you have chosen the best-sized tips, Anker has a Tip Fit Test within the Soundcore app.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The app plays about 10 seconds of ringtone-esque orchestral music, then displays a “good seal” or “bad seal” result for each earbud. (Yes, it’s basically just like what Apple does with the AirPods Pro. Inspiration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtfrn"&gt;There is also an audio test called HearID that claims to map your personal hearing sensitivity at multiple frequencies to best tailor the EQ settings for you.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It plays about 30 different tones per ear and asks you to confirm if you can hear the tone or not.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Next, you are presented with a graph of your results and an EQ preset saved to the app. My test resulted in deep bass and less treble, which did make my music sound fuller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt2KWn"&gt;Both the fit tests and EQ settings test are something several other earbud makers are doing these days, and although not everyone finds these tests useful, I appreciate having the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PLYeeW077BLcza6TBH82WFT5z5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360979/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0003_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro case slides open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YbjWARftIxaHe8UjMblAR_UZ7po=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360980/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a decorative gold fan-like cover over the earbud’s speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wbFAZL"&gt;The case, large and almost stone-like in appearance, slides to open and close with a satisfying click. It most closely resembles the case of the Galaxy Buds Pro — it’s longer than it is tall — but its larger size makes it not as pocketable as most earbud cases. There are three battery indicator lights on the front and a button for pairing around back. That may sound like a small detail, but I’ve come to really appreciate earbuds that have a physical button for pairing. It’s far easier to use than tapping the earbuds to pair like you have to on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Jabra Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQeVDK"&gt;Like most earbuds, the Air 2 Pro have tap controls when you’re wearing them: double-tap on the left bud to skip the next track, double-tap on the right for play and pause, or hold down for two seconds on either bud to toggle ambient sound modes. It’s great that the buds respond quickly to my taps, but I’m frustrated by how limited the controls are. All of them can be customized in the app, but I wish there was a single-tap or even triple-tap option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJ4xRS"&gt;Either bud can be used independently of the other, and in-ear detection can be toggled on and off in Anker’s app. Take an earbud out of your ear, and your music will stop; put the bud back in your ear, and it will resume. The in-ear detection was a bit sensitive for my liking. When I had a hood on, for example, every time the earbud was knocked by my hood, my music would pause even if the bud was still seated in my ear. A quick readjustment of the bud would get my music playing again but ultimately turned off the in-ear detection feature entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLnscI"&gt;The battery life is on par with other ANC earbuds. Anker claims seven hours of battery life with ANC turned off or six hours with it turned on. There are three additional charges in the case, which can be recharged wirelessly or via the USB-C port on the back. This was more than enough juice to get me to the point of my ears needing a break from the buds’ tight, in-ear seal. There is also 15-minute fast charging that can get three hours of listening time when the case is plugged into an outlet via USB-C. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jA6ItNw0-5LdIgqmJcrfmSXbX2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360978/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three battery indicator lights on the front of the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H4eFYG"&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro support SBC and AAC audio codecs. They have 11mm drivers that create a more treble-heavy sound. While music felt full and immersive with crisp separation, I often wanted more bass. Lifting the lows in the app’s EQ helped, but it wasn’t as clean-sounding as the bass in the AirPods Pro. 1970s funk and soul sounded great, but more contemporary R&amp;amp;B felt a bit flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKjfWA"&gt;I was most impressed with the active noise cancellation on the Liberty Air 2 Pro. Outside of Amazon’s Echo Buds, there really aren’t many options at this price that even include it, much less do it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jLtV7"&gt;The Air 2 Pro have three ambient sound modes: full noise cancellation, transparency mode, and normal. Within the full ANC and transparency modes, there are more specific controls for managing the levels of passthrough sound. You can enable a Transport mode for canceling low-end frequencies, such as train rumbles; Indoor mode for midrange frequencies; an Outdoor mode that Anker claims is best for city spaces; or build a custom mode for dialing in the best setting for you.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I set my ANC to Transport and left it there for most of my time and found it comparable to the ANC in the Jabra Elite 85t, a set of earbuds that costs $100 more than Anker’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrEyQM"&gt;The noise cancellation let the outside world fade away, but it wasn’t as isolating as the AirPods Pro or Galaxy Buds Pro. And although the transparency mode is serviceable, it doesn’t have the same earbud-less feel of the AirPods Pro either. There is a Vocal transparency mode that takes out lower frequencies while allowing higher frequencies, such as voices, through. It was helpful when listening for train announcements, but ultimately, taking an earbud out to hear an announcement was far easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3JO_fZOB27cjAXZ1QJLwk34WfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360985/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Soundcore app is is well-designed and easy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3wCO_npLr0ARMjYGoOeKEUCWZs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360986/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The app contains many ambient sound controls that are fun to play with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="21jJej"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10386178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mYywUV"&gt;Most apps for wireless earbuds are so bad that I open them once to set EQ settings and some custom touch controls, and that’s it. The Soundcore app had me coming back to it time and time again, though, mostly to play with all of the different controls it offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RACrzN"&gt;When I was bored on the train, I would open the app and start testing out all of the transparency modes while strangers spoke to each other across the car. I also had fun turning the EQ settings up and down. The app is filled with pleasing colors and is easy to navigate, which is surprisingly rare in the earbud market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ogyvn"&gt;In a wireless earbud market full of worthy (and not so worthy) competition, it is increasingly hard to be impressed by a new pair of buds. But the competitive $130 price tag of the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro brought me in, and their true active noise cancellation and well-designed app kept me coming back for more.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They could certainly use a bit more bass and a smaller case, but Anker has made a pair of wireless earbuds that bridges the gap between a more budget-friendly option and a reliable, all-around great earbud that I was excited to put into my ears every day.&lt;/p&gt;
