    <title>The latest Oculus Quest update lets you easily invite others to play</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-OIU1O4ix0BYc7bDFEoqVw6k_M=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613411/echovrinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UTi0bV"&gt;Oculus is rolling out its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fnew-oculus-software-update-makes-it-easier-to-play-games-with-friends-and-adds-new-security-settings%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;v31 software update&lt;/a&gt; to Quest and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Quest 2 headsets&lt;/a&gt; starting today, and it’s filled with some nice quality-of-life improvements. The big one is it’ll be easier to invite friends and recent teammates who aren’t friends to play a game or experience an app together. When you’re in game or in app, pressing the Oculus button will pull up the universal menu as usual, but soon, more apps will show a new “Invite to App” button next to the “Resume” and “Quit” buttons. If friends accept your invite, you’ll be able to see them in the menu. This feature will roll out soon in games like &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blaston&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demeo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Echo VR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ForeVR Bowl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hyper Dash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PokerStars VR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBeCSI"&gt;If you don’t want to corral the group within VR, an upcoming update to the Oculus app on iOS and Android will let you create a multiplayer session then and there. For supported games and apps, you’ll be able to whip up a link that can be shared with others to join the group. You can also choose how long the link will be active. Any major platform with a social component should have intuitive invite tools like these, and I’m glad to see that Oculus is making some progress here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qpLsGKr0C8er9zdGEvhzi-JLdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731449/oculussecurity5.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qy0kpr"&gt;Other features coming in v31 may or may not get as much use, depending on how you use your Quest headset, but are nevertheless important. With the update, the Browser app will also gain the ability to save and autofill passwords, secured with an unlock pattern. Both the unlock pattern and passwords are stored on device, Oculus says in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fnew-oculus-software-update-makes-it-easier-to-play-games-with-friends-and-adds-new-security-settings%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX0uI0"&gt;Oculus is also adding send and read receipts to the Messenger app as well as reaction emoji — straight from Facebook. Admittedly, this should make it easier to respond to people instead of fumbling with the virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgkRsa"&gt;If you’re waiting for v31 to hit your headset, keep in mind that it may take a few weeks to arrive on yours.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix thinks games matter more than buying movie studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Netflix stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKPCifbL-c4n7OssZgfLOJGpchw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613287/netflix-stock-0883.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghjZPn"&gt;As Netflix’s streaming rivals like Prime Video and HBO Max’s WarnerMedia focus on consolidation and studio acquisitions, Netflix is instead prioritizing its own service and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;investment in games&lt;/a&gt; over snapping up any available studio IP. It’s a refreshing shift away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;buying distressed movie studios&lt;/a&gt; or long-forgotten catalogs. But will it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HRDnf"&gt;Netflix spelled out its streaming strategy in its &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;second quarter letter&lt;/a&gt; to its shareholders. Citing recent mergers between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;WarnerMedia and Discovery&lt;/a&gt; and the last decade of acquisitions and mergers between major media properties — for example, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;Disney and Fox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/13/20746894/cbs-viacom-merger-acquisition-all-access-mtv-bet-streaming-value"&gt;Viacom and CBS&lt;/a&gt; — the company said it doesn’t “believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if at all.” (If I’m a streaming service right now, surely that one has to sting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhE8ao"&gt;Moreover, Netflix isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;shopping for studios&lt;/a&gt; in the same way its rivals have been. Netflix’s strategy instead continues to be simply making itself better. Put another way, Netflix wants to be more like social apps than other streaming services. Its main competitor in the space, according to Netflix, is itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwQkhV"&gt;“While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as ‘must-have’ and we haven’t yet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon,” the company wrote in its shareholders letter. “In the race to entertain consumers around the world, we continue to compete for screen time with a broad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok (to name just a few). But, we are mostly competing with ourselves to improve our service as fast as we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRvH9V"&gt;For a company that seems uninterested in shopping for movie studios, Netflix executives touched on the acquisition and consolidation race a number of times during the earnings call on Tuesday. While Netflix is open to the right opportunity, the company’s top brass said that Netflix is “picky” when it comes to assets and IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fJqqwc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as ‘must-have’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CwcIcx"&gt;To be clear, Netflix is still leading in the ongoing battle for our eyeballs (and our money). Netflix, which has around 209 million paid subscriptions, is most closely tailed by Disney Plus, which has roughly half that number of paid memberships. With its decade-plus lead on other streaming services, Netflix has more runway to experiment with its product and take the kinds of risks that smaller services simply cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DlqWw"&gt;That brings us to games. While Netflix hasn’t given us a specific timeline for game releases, beyond saying the initiative would be a multiyear endeavor, the company did say it believes “the time is right” to explore the expansion. Netflix has said repeatedly that it believes its primary competitors are high-engagement venues like TikTok and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But Netflix’s dive into gaming in earnest — rather than through one-off experiments like a &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; game or even &lt;em&gt;Bandersnatch —&lt;/em&gt; comes at a transitional time for the streaming giant as the world begins to reopen and streaming faces new hurdles for hooking and retaining subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5XIXc"&gt;The company said that it added 1.5 million paid memberships in the second quarter of 2021 over its 1 million guidance forecast, even while it lost some 400,000 paid net adds. But while the company said its business is healthy and its churn rate — the number of members leaving the service — is down when compared to a more “comparable” quarter from 2019, CFO Spencer Neumann said during the company’s earnings interview that Netflix is still feeling “a little bit of that drag in terms of our acquisition growth as we’re kind of working through what we hope is — and we can’t be sure — but what we hope is the tail end of this covid chopiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8a0xp"&gt;When looking at the company’s future challenges this way, Netflix’s big bet on gaming tracks. It creates new ways to extend the shelf life of content and characters that are already resonating with viewers. But what would Netflix games even look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tv4xuL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix believes games will help it build engagement around its content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cev1P5"&gt;Speaking to the company’s strategy for gaming moving forward, Netflix COO and chief product officer Greg Peters reiterated during the call that the company viewed gaming as “an extension of the core entertainment offering that we’ve been focused on for the last 20 years.” It plans to develop games for mobile first, though other formats may be considered down the line. And while Netflix plans to experiment with its approach to gaming, Peters said it will include licensing opportunities, games that build on its existing IP, and standalone games. According to Peters, that could even include a game that generates enough hype to be spun into a film or series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yEuX4"&gt;“Just as we’ve continuously expanded our offering by adding new genres, unscripted, film, local-language programming, animation, on and on, we think we have an opportunity to add games to that offering and deliver more entertainment value to our members,” Peters said. He added that the company planned to “start relatively small” and that Netflix’s foray into the gaming space would be a “multi-year effort.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWfn1U"&gt;Whether the gamification of Netflix content will help it scale in any meaningful way is impossible to say right now. But Netflix’s focus on content and product over IP acquisitions and mergers — the preferred play by most of its streaming peers at present — indicates that Netflix is very much still operating in a league of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC pledges to fight unlawful right to repair restrictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfbtWGEnAjvFfrFzdf_YMqEGuRY=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613129/1232439143.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDOho7"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission formally pledged to take on unlawful “right to repair” restrictions in a new policy statement issued Wednesday. The new policy could spell trouble for smartphone manufacturers like Apple that strictly inhibit users’ abilities to repair their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nditej"&gt;Wednesday’s new right to repair policy statement commits the FTC to encouraging competition in product repair markets with “vigor,” according to Chair Lina Khan. The statement, which was approved unanimously, makes it official FTC policy for the agency to use its existing authorities to support independent repair shops and lower repair costs for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77QymA"&gt;“While efforts by dominant firms to restrict repair markets are not new, changes in technology and more prevalent use of software has created fresh opportunities for companies to limit independent repair,” Khan said Wednesday. “These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunities for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, delay timely repairs, and undermine resiliency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li1Iyl"&gt;The statement comes just days after the White House endorsed similar rules in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; on economic competition. In the order, signed by President Joe Biden on July 9th, the White House explicitly calls out smartphone makers that “impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools.” At Wednesday’s meeting, the FTC did not name any specific companies or industries that it could target in future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2qAEj"&gt;The move was lauded by right to repair advocates like iFixit. In a statement Wednesday, iFixit’s US policy lead Kerry Sheehan said, “The FTC’s progress addressing repair restrictions shows how much momentum Right to Repair has achieved, and how powerful our community can be when we work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j8wy9"&gt;“The adoption of today’s policy statement makes clear that the Commission will investigate unlawful repair restrictions, using the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and other consumer protection laws, as well as antitrust law to promote fair and open repair markets,” Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KImRzw"&gt;Wednesday’s open session was just the second since Khan was confirmed as chair at an agency that traditionally works behind closed doors. In the first proceeding earlier this month, Khan’s FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559131/ftc-open-meeting-antitrust-chair-lina-khan-sherman-act-powers"&gt;passed a pair of competition measures&lt;/a&gt;, setting the agency up to take more aggressive action on antitrust violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRBzO5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 7/21/21 at 3:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from iFixit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this WSJ investigation of TikTok’s algorithm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMtiMh2tey_Xd8nIfRb4KxX7x-I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613102/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dru3s"&gt;TikTok users often express awe or dismay at the seemingly uncanny accuracy of the app’s recommendation algorithm. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/inside-tiktoks-highly-secretive-algorithm/investigation-how-tiktok-algorithm-figures-out-your-deepest-desires/6C0C2040-FF25-4827-8528-2BD6612E3796"&gt;published a video&lt;/a&gt; today that dives into how TikTok customizes your feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk7cbr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; investigators ran an experiment where they created bot accounts with assigned interests. The bots “watched” videos in TikTok, pausing or replaying any that had images or hashtags relevant to those interests. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; team reviewed the results with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth"&gt;Guillaume Chaslot&lt;/a&gt;, an algorithm expert who previously worked at YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psGVNF"&gt;The findings line up with TikTok’s explanations of how its recommendations work. TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you"&gt;has previously said&lt;/a&gt; the For You feed is personalized based on the kinds of videos you interact with, how you interact with them, details about the videos themselves, and account settings like language and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TXUmq"&gt;If you hesitate on a weird video that caught you off guard, there’s no way for the algorithm to differentiate that from content you actually like and want to see more of. That’s how some people end up with a bunch of For You recommendations that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/your-tiktok-feed-embarrassing/619257/"&gt;don’t seem to reflect their interests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K3wysh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Look at this hashtag map we put together. In the middle is the mainstream of TikTok. The arms are the rabbit holes. As you go down the arms, the content has less views and can be less moderated. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Niva4NT7LO"&gt;https://t.co/Niva4NT7LO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dKp2NtQ3lu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dKp2NtQ3lu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joanna Stern (@JoannaStern) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1417856559611359239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJEMS"&gt;Though humans have more diverse tastes than bots, the experiment demonstrates how quickly a user can be exposed to far reaches of potentially harmful content. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, TikTok identified the interests of some of the bots in as few as 40 minutes. One of the bots fell into a rabbit hole of depressive videos, while another ended up at videos about election conspiracies. Though as Will Oremus &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1417866336609488898"&gt;points out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, algorithmic rabbit holes can also bring people to positive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub3Sd3"&gt;The video has a lot of details and visualizations, so it’s a good way to wrap your head around the “magic” of how TikTok works. Watch the video above or &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/inside-tiktoks-highly-secretive-algorithm/investigation-how-tiktok-algorithm-figures-out-your-deepest-desires/6C0C2040-FF25-4827-8528-2BD6612E3796"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; site&lt;/a&gt; — though be warned it includes clips from TikToks that reference depression, suicide, and eating disorders. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ brief trip to space was also a commercial for Rivian</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iA6X63ZZHK1q1VUfjTOWbI_Q6So=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613044/rivian_blue_origin_4830.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos by Joey Roulette / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ush37m"&gt;After years of preparation and billions of dollars spent on the project, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos got to be one of the first people to ride a rocket built by his &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;company, Blue Origin, to the edge of space. But the event itself was also a chance for Bezos to promote a third investment in the wider Amazon portfolio: EV startup Rivian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mu78zh"&gt;Throughout the broadcast, Rivian’s electric pickup truck and SUV could be seen shuttling Bezos and his fellow astronauts around — an unsurprising decision considering Amazon now owns &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;more than 10 percent of the EV startup&lt;/a&gt; after leading and participating in multiple funding rounds. The hosts of Blue Origin’s livestream made sure to let everyone watching know what they were seeing, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r2ErQG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With commercial space, everything’s an ad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0W5BsR"&gt;“And here the astronauts come. There you see Jeff Bezos in the foreground, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578356/blue-origin-new-shepard-teen-jeff-bezos-space-anonymous-auction"&gt;Oliver Daemen&lt;/a&gt; stepping into the Rivian,” Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s director of “astronaut and orbital sales,” cheerily said during the broadcast as the group hopped in one of the startup’s SUVs to head to the rocket for their ride to space. Then we got a long, continuous aerial shot of the electric SUV driving toward the pad, split side-by-side during an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558908/wally-funk-flight-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-new-shepard"&gt;Mercury 13 legend Wally Funk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng3D2D"&gt;After the crew safely landed an hour later, there they were again: a set of Rivian pickups and SUVs rumbling over the West Texas landscape to greet the recently returned astronauts. (The electric vehicles were tucked in among a few other pickup trucks and SUVs made by Ford — which also owns more than 10 percent of Rivian.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CrcqTB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10662656"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ljI34"&gt;The Rivians — likely on loan, due to the fact that they’re still wearing manufacturer plates — weren’t just there for the sake of the broadcast, either. At one point, Blue Origin used the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/rivians-camp-kitchen-in-action/"&gt;slide-out camping kitchen&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of Rivian pickups to cook up sausages and carne asada for guests attending the launch — an optional feature that the startup has promoted a lot in the run-up to production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5icsb"&gt;Blue Origin is a private company, and much like Virgin Galactic — which launched founder Richard Branson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;to the edge of space&lt;/a&gt; less than two weeks ago — this first mission was as much about promotion as it was about science or exploration. But while Branson’s event had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;music festival vibe&lt;/a&gt;, Blue Origin’s was more in line with Bezos’ notorious calculation. It was a chance for him to promote the things he plans to spend his time on now that he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;no longer Amazon CEO&lt;/a&gt;, like his space company and his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321793/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-new-president-ceo"&gt;climate fund&lt;/a&gt;, and to toss a bone to the electric vehicle company that Amazon has dumped a bunch of money into. Perhaps the only surprising thing is that the delivery van Rivian is building for Amazon wasn’t there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LgV6GY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian already has plenty of money — but it is planning an IPO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2bGwLB"&gt;It’s not like Rivian, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;delayed the first deliveries of its pickup truck and SUV to later this year&lt;/a&gt;, really &lt;em&gt;needs &lt;/em&gt;the attention. The startup has already raised more than $8 billion to date. Rivian has also already proven adept at coming up with &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33548089/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-long-way-up-tv/"&gt;its own effective cross-promotions&lt;/a&gt;. But Rivian &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;currently in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;preparing an initial public offering&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s possible this display of corporate synergy plays right into the hands of the bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3En8Y"&gt;The commercialization of the space industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/20981714/spacex-commercial-spaceflight-space-industry-decade-nasa-business"&gt;been happening for a while&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s really ramped up in recent years as companies like Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX matured. These companies have set out to dominate everything from the “boring” tasks like cargo runs and science missions to the riskier endeavors like strapping people inside a spaceship. They’ve realized the value of the eyeballs these missions attract, too. After all, before SpaceX launched the first humans to space from United States soil last year, those astronauts also took a promotional ride to the rocket — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/05/13/tesla-model-x-new-official-vehicle-transport-nasa-astronauts-spacex/#"&gt;in a Tesla Model X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos eyes space as a new ‘sacrifice zone’  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin New Shepard Space Vehicle Flies The Billionaire And Other Passengers To Space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CWbi8sK0ejk0rmkxLfl1MYKhsp0=/0x6:3000x2006/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612961/1329731025.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rRQWd"&gt;After Jeff Bezos’ brief &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;escape from&lt;/a&gt; Earth yesterday, the founder of retail giant Amazon had an idea. “We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry, and move it into space and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,” he said in an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/jeff-bezos-says-spaceflight-reinforced-commitment-solving-climate-chan-rcna1467"&gt;interview with NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s going to take decades to achieve, but you have to start. And big things start with small steps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9qnqiI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Long before rich, white men were catapulting themselves into space, they approached whatever was the “frontier” at the time with dollar signs in their eyes and destruction in their wake&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e7dafJ"&gt;Big things do start with small steps, but this particular idea is a big step backward. Jetting up to space to manufacture stuff in zero gravity is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/jeff-bezos-we-need-to-move-all-polluting-industry-into-1847328711"&gt;logistical nightmare with astronomical costs&lt;/a&gt;, to say the least. And it’s not actually a very innovative plan. Sticking unwanted stuff in a place that’s seemingly out of sight, out of mind is a tired idea. It’s the same old mindset that has dumped industrial waste on colonized peoples and neighborhoods of color for centuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8q61p2"&gt;Long before rich, white men were catapulting themselves into space, they approached whatever was the “frontier” at the time with dollar signs in their eyes and destruction in their wake. As a result today, land sacred to the Shoshone and Paiute tribes was designated a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17765538/san-onofre-nuclear-generating-station-radioactive-spent-fuel-waste-yucca-mountain"&gt;nuclear dump site&lt;/a&gt; in Nevada. A rural stretch of land along the Mississippi River, where formerly enslaved people and their descendants made their homes, became &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086172"&gt;Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley”&lt;/a&gt; after more than 150 refineries and petrochemical facilities moved in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP6y5v"&gt;Their land and homes became “sacrifice zones” for industry and Western development, environmental justice advocates often say. As Amazon’s founder, Bezos is responsible for the creation of new “sacrifice zones” for his retail empire’s warehouses. Those still need to be addressed — maybe he could start there, before creating any new ones in space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uz1W2R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You know what's also amazing? Paying taxes, treating workers with dignity &amp;amp; taking stock of one's carbon footprint as floods &amp;amp; fires rage. For too long, frontline communities have been the sacrifice zones for the excesses of rich. Our communities need real climate action NOW. &lt;a href="https://t.co/C080jaO9U5"&gt;https://t.co/C080jaO9U5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GGJ (@ggjalliance) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ggjalliance/status/1417557915389419520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ReFRXh"&gt;Speaking personally, Amazon now has a huge footprint in the region where I grew up, California’s “Inland Empire.” When I was a kid there, the place was still sort of the badlands of Los Angeles — a potential pitstop for city and beach town dwellers on their drive through the desert to Las Vegas. It was a place that was out of sight and out of mind for the Bezoses of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rB54R"&gt;Now the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;region is increasingly dominated by retail warehouses&lt;/a&gt; that butt up against peoples’ houses and are magnets for polluting trucks and planes. The Inland Empire has some of the &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/san-bernardino-county-california-air-pollution-logistics-industry/"&gt;worst air pollution in the nation&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is its biggest private employer in the region, and it’s faced pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;residents&lt;/a&gt; and its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt; to clean up its act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TStmB"&gt;“Every time I see one of those [Amazon] trucks with a smiley face on it, it feels like it’s taunting people,” says Adrian Martinez, a senior attorney with the nonprofit organization Earthjustice. Earthjustice currently represents environmental groups that have filed suit against the developer of a new air cargo logistics center in the Inland Empire that &lt;a href="https://www.sbsun.com/2021/04/28/amazon-begins-operations-at-san-bernardino-airport-hub/"&gt;houses Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An Amazon Prime truck drives into the BNSF rail yard.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Amazon Prime truck drives into the BNSF rail yard across the street from a soccer field and community center in San Bernardino, California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IjKGcH"&gt;Amazon and Bezos have both made splashy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;pledges to combat climate change&lt;/a&gt;. But the residents Martinez represents are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;still breathing in Amazon’s pollution&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s what they are, they’re pledges. And I think I’ll feel a lot more confident when I see zero emission trucks rolling through the neighborhoods of my clients,” Martinez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jurjA"&gt;People like Martinez aren’t asking Bezos, Amazon, or other corporate polluters to move their pollution into space. They’re asking for things like more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;electric delivery vehicles&lt;/a&gt; on the road, a much lighter lift than figuring out how to expand industry in space. They’re asking for the pollution to stop in the first place, and for billionaires to stop engineering new “sacrifice zones.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa finally gets a masculine-sounding voice option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eWzPn1Dd31yriz53CqGjX-jtMac=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612703/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xk1l0q"&gt;Amazon has quietly started rolling out a new &lt;a href="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/fa/c1/7a7f256f4a8d8905a253bf234cf6/traffic.wav"&gt;masculine-sounding voice option&lt;/a&gt; to its Alexa virtual assistant along with a similarly masculine-sounding wake word to trigger the assistant: “Ziggy.” (The odd choice of name is presumably to fit into Amazon’s love of “A to Z”-style branding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITORBH"&gt;The new voice option was actually added several days ago alongside an announcement for new celebrity voices like Shaq and Melissa McCarthy, but it went largely unnoticed until it was &lt;a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/news/alexa-male-voice-now-available-ziggy-2675"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Ambient&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You can hear a sample of the new voice option &lt;a href="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/fa/c1/7a7f256f4a8d8905a253bf234cf6/traffic.wav"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ddqlDt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new voice for Amazon’s digital assistant&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zjqck0"&gt;The “Ziggy” wake word joins the existing “Alexa,” “Computer,” “Echo,” and “Amazon” wake words that have already been available to use with Alexa for years. Amazon isn’t specifically associating “Alexa” with the feminine-sounding voice and “Ziggy” with the new masculine-sounding option; users can use either of the voice options with any of the wake words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QO80c"&gt;You can switch between the two voice options — which Amazon refers to as “Original” and “New” — by asking Alexa to “Change your voice,” and you can similarly select a new wake word by asking it to “Change your wake word.” The change seems to be device-specific, though, so you’ll have to set the new voice on each of your Alexa devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmUuRs"&gt;Amazon has been a holdout when it comes to offering a masculine-sounding voice option for its digital assistant; Apple and Google offer multiple voice options for Siri and Google Assistant, respectively. Neither of those companies associates specific voices with gender anymore, either: Apple’s Siri options are presented as “Voice 1” and “Voice 2,” while Google’s voice options are listed under a variety of colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s43rj90HfgzAuy2Y_Rv8vbH4iB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731112/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s new “Alexa’s Voice” setting menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jX_gyj_41v1nGKvcxnAhOoBndBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731104/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now choose between the “Original” feminine-sounding voice and the “New” masculine-sounding option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v1fle9"&gt;Amazon has only offered its feminine-sounding option since the Echo was first introduced back in 2013. And while &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/us/alexa-bots-female-voice.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Alexa will respond to questions about gender by replying “I’m not a woman or a man, I’m an AI,” Amazon itself still tends to refer to the Alexa personality using gendered “she” and “her” pronouns in &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/contact-pr"&gt;its documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHGkTQ"&gt;That’s despite that same documentation emphasizing that Alexa is not “a person with a physical body or a gender identity” and that “Amazon doesn’t let organizations (for example, skills or AVS) refer to Alexa as ‘she’ or ‘her.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVpXRk"&gt;The new masculine-sounding Alexa voice option is reportedly only available in the US for now, but it will presumably be making its way to other regions soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘PlugWalkJoe’ arrested in connection with 2020 hack of famous Twitter accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A2oj96oEEcSERl5_AYH9Lalh8hY=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612639/VRG_ILLO_1777_twitter_bitcoin_verified.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ubzir0"&gt;Joseph O’Connor, a 22-year-old UK citizen who goes by the handle “PlugWalkJoe,” was arrested in Spain on Wednesday for his connection to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;the 2020 Twitter hack&lt;/a&gt; that compromised the accounts of former President Barack Obama and Elon Musk, and ran off with over $100,000 in Bitcoin. In &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-arrested-connection-alleged-role-twitter-hack"&gt;a press release announcing the arrest&lt;/a&gt;, the US Justice Department writes that O’Connor is also being charged with “computer intrusions related to takeovers of TikTok and Snapchat user accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgsl2C"&gt;O’Connor was arrested on multiple counts of conspiring to and illegally accessing computers without authorization, and “with the intent to extort from a person a thing of value, transmitting a communication containing a threat,” among several other charges, the Justice Department writes. According to &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krebs on Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, O’Connor was a well-known sim-swapper, a method of hijacking valuable social media accounts by manipulating cellular network employees to duplicate phone numbers so hackers can intercept two-factor authorization requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dpdRrH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They can come arrest me. I would laugh at them. I haven’t done anything.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tfXbdt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;In an interview for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;conducted with several of the hackers associated with the Twitter breach, O’Connor openly identified himself as “PlugWalkJoe” and confirmed that the hackers had obtained Twitter credentials to take over the accounts via an internal company Slack. At the time, O’Connor was fairly bullish about his involvement and apparent safety, “They can come arrest me. I would laugh at them. I haven’t done anything,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlUaD8"&gt;Today’s arrest is just the latest in the fallout from the breach. Graham Ivan Clark, the “teenage mastermind” of the entire plan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349920/twitter-hack-arrest-florida-teen-fbi-irs-secret-service"&gt;was arrested alongside&lt;/a&gt; Nima “Rolex” Fazeli and Mason “Chaewon” Sheppard in July last year. Clark has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334421/twitter-hacker-bitcoin-plea-deal-agreement-graham-ivan-clark-three-years"&gt;sentenced to three years in prison&lt;/a&gt; for his role in the hack.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse is no longer invite-only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TKHB35Lk5kjnpFYyCfpHrJUOluc=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612529/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XV6Gcb"&gt;Clubhouse is going wide. Co-founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth announced today that the app is no longer invite-only. Around 10 million people are currently on the waitlist, a spokesperson confirms, and they’ll slowly be added to the app over time. (Essentially, millions of users won’t be added today, but seemingly, if you attempt to sign up anew, you’ll be able to do so.) Along with the news, Clubhouse showed off a new logo, as well as a new app icon: Justin “Meezy” Williams, rapper 21 Savage’s manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5U2C6"&gt;“The invite system has been an important part of our early history,” a blog post about the changes says. “By adding people in waves, welcoming new faces each week in our Wednesday Orientations, and talking with the community each Sunday in Town Hall, we’ve been able to grow Clubhouse in a measured way, and keep things from breaking as we’ve scaled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYazJs"&gt;This change comes only a week after Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576771/clubhouse-dm-backchannel-update-message"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its DM product, Backchannel, which the team now says saw 10 million messages sent within the first day of launch, and more than 90 million over the first week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8U9Mp"&gt;Of course, the app opening up comes amid increasing competition. As Clubhouse built out its product and acquired a waitlist, other social audio products, like Twitter Spaces, opened to everyone. If Clubhouse wants to compete, and keep acquiring new users, it’ll have to make sure everyone can actually access it. Part of that journey was bringing the app to Android, in addition to iOS, and now it’s completed the second major step, which is removing any gating around new user signup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WHO head cheers Olympic ‘hope’ as COVID-19 cases in athletes’ village rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Before the Tokyo Olympics" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQzk6Q-vEXHQ-jWGH9UjbrVvUHE=/0x223:6633x4645/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612289/1234022012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jVJpmA"&gt;Olympic athletes in Tokyo continue to test positive for COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://gtimg.tokyo2020.org/image/upload/production/rbhzrrsabvocck506t2s.pdf"&gt;by the dozens&lt;/a&gt;, the United States gymnastics team &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/20/u-s-womens-gymnastics-team-bolts-olympic-village/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow"&gt;left the Olympic Village&lt;/a&gt; for a hotel in an attempt to avoid the virus, and the chief of the games’ organizing committee said there &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/31847805/tokyo-2020-organizing-committee-chief-rule-cancellation-summer-olympics"&gt;could still be a last-minute cancellation&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the head of the World Health Organization said Wednesday that the Tokyo Olympics could “inspire” and “bring the world together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzp9LH"&gt;“It is my sincere hope the Tokyo Games succeed,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday. He said it was impossible to expect zero cases of COVID-19, and that the most important thing would be to isolate people, contact trace, and stop the virus from spreading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t78KYz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Beyond competition, medals &amp;amp; records, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tokyo2020?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tokyo2020&lt;/a&gt; Games bring the nations of the   together in celebration of sport, health, excellence, friendship &amp;amp; respect. But ultimately, they are a celebration of something that our   needs now, more than ever:     "-&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DrTedros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1417654668776415235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXwzQ3"&gt;His optimism around the games stands in contrast to the Japanese medical community, which has called for the Olympics &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/olympics-tokyo-covid-19-1.6032206"&gt;to be canceled&lt;/a&gt;. COVID-19 cases are rising in Japan, and only around a third of medical providers are vaccinated. The games offer a chance for the virus to spread and are a risk to the health of the athletes and people in the community. Still, it’s a risk the WHO seems to think is reasonable to take, even as Ghebreyesus said that governments should commit to public health measures in the face of rising case counts. “If we throw caution to the wind, it will blow back in our faces,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1417650711203139593"&gt;also said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3CJLO"&gt;The WHO has a close relationship with the International Olympic Committee that stretches back decades. The two groups signed their first memorandum of understanding &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-and-who-strengthen-ties-to-advocate-healthy-lifestyles"&gt;in 1984&lt;/a&gt;. They reaffirmed that partnership in a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/07-01-2011-who-and-the-international-olympic-committee-sign-agreement-to-improve-healthy-lifestyles"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; memorandum focused on promoting healthy lifestyles, and signed another &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-and-who-strengthen-ties-to-advocate-healthy-lifestyles"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoSbBq"&gt;Experts worried about the relationship ahead of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, which were held as the Zika virus — which the WHO called a Public Health Emergency of International Concern — spread through Brazil. A group of physicians called for the games to be moved or rescheduled and said &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2016/05/Zika-Olympics-Open-Letter-to-WHO-current2.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_17"&gt;in an open letter&lt;/a&gt; that they did not feel the WHO was appropriately assessing the risks of the virus. “We are concerned that WHO is rejecting these alternatives because of a conflict of interest,” the letter read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B91Pk7"&gt;The WHO’s support of the Tokyo Olympics also creates the appearance of conflict, wrote MacIntosh Ross, an assistant professor of sports management at Western University in Canada, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-who-and-the-ioc-are-playing-with-lives-at-state-of-emergency-tokyo-olympics-164291"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The stakes of holding the games during a pandemic are high for people in Japan, but the IOC stands to benefit financially if they go ahead, he wrote — and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-olympic-games-2020-tokyo-olympics-dd49a7aaaa6c59defea9670c5b19475c"&gt;lose billions&lt;/a&gt; if they don’t. It’s disconcerting to have even the suggestion that the WHO’s concerns aren’t first with the community in Tokyo. Yet, Ross adds: “When the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it’s difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
