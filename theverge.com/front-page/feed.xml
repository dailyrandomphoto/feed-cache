  &lt;p id="qjE3c0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21026128/apple-arcade-best-games-iphone-ipad"&gt;This time last year&lt;/a&gt;, Apple Arcade was still a fledgling service, but one with a lot of potential. For $5 a month, you could get unlimited access to a big library of interesting games, the kind that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;no one really sells in the App Store anymore&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still not a place to find the latest blockbusters, but Arcade has steadily evolved into one of the best deals in gaming. Its lineup of games is varied and consistently surprising, with everything from family-friendly multiplayer games to engrossing puzzlers to weird story-driven adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="i9dgoI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Apple Arcade","description":"$4.99 a month from Apple","label":"Subscribe now","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-arcade%2F&amp;amp;amp;xcust=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="J2w1I7"&gt;If you just picked up a new Apple device and have signed up for Arcade (a new device gets you &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1529488016?ign-itsct=arc-0-arc_ovp-promo-apl-offer-191019&amp;amp;ign-itscg=10000"&gt;three months free&lt;/a&gt;) the sheer number of games available can be overwhelming. Here are a few great places to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N15Jwh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951417"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android phones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21943103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21952855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M1-equipped Macs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; our favorite mobile games from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942272"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21934070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and our top choices for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929534"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gaming PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929530"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox One and Series X / S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938238"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

(Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IopIyY"&gt;Butter Royale&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Butter Royale" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EGMKe8BCucArqWxryU1hRngx2bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19704422/03_SquadFight.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mighty Bear Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butter Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FTiuTa"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402888/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-update-iphone-ipad-mac-battle-pass"&gt;no longer a viable iOS experience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21128166/butter-royale-apple-arcade-iphone-ipad-fortnite-mighty-bear-games-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butter Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might just be your next best option. Like Epic’s massive hit, &lt;em&gt;Butter Royale&lt;/em&gt; is a colorful shooter where the goal is to be the last player standing. But there are a few key differences. Battles play out from a top-down perspective, like a classic arcade game, and the game is decidedly nonviolent, with weapons that shoot ketchup and popcorn instead of bullets. Perhaps the best part is that, because it’s part of Arcade, there are no in-app purchases, so you don’t have to worry about dropping real cash on a cute giraffe costume for your character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sUMVML"&gt;Creaks&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Creaks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJy7i5dsBAGzn7SoJHQloc6v4UI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174602/ss_a83a79a1a87ca1e5841ee1bdf11d79cd3eff5861.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amanita Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RSDeKD"&gt;Czech studio Amanita Design is known for dark, atmospheric point-and-click adventure games, but it’s also a developer that isn’t afraid to experiment. &lt;em&gt;Creaks&lt;/em&gt; keeps the unsettling vibe, but transposes it onto a sort of puzzle / platformer hybrid. You explore a sprawling mansion, one that never seems to end, while finding ways to manipulate machines and monsters to help you get through to the end. As with Amanita’s past work, it takes place in an absolutely gorgeous hand-drawn world, but the action is a bit more cerebral this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm4vKm"&gt;Games of Thrones: Tale of Crows&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Games of Thrones: Tale of Crows " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1CqGvquWVnwlSV5jpFm7_RNS02M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21730735/Game_of_Thrones_Tale_of_Crows___Screen_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Devolver Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games of Thrones: Tale of Crows &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pQpGDe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365603/game-of-thrones-got-tale-of-crows-review-apple-arcade-iphone-ipad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones: Tale of Crows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a game where you don’t actually do very much. It fits snugly into the idle genre, where the idea is to set plans in motion and then see how they play out. Here, you’re put in charge of the infamous Night’s Watch from &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;. It’s sort of a management game. People come to you with problems, you’ll have to send rangers out on scouting trips, and kingdoms from around Westeros will ask for your help. All of these things take time; you might have to wait a few hours before a group of rangers sends back a raven detailing their battle with some wildlings. &lt;em&gt;Tale of Crows&lt;/em&gt; is a game full of death and danger, but it’s also surprisingly soothing. And it fits neatly into your life: all you have to do is play a few minutes every so often to see the story unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qPUKcq"&gt;Grindstone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="hOwQvq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UI9MLk521Es?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGKISB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grindstone &lt;/em&gt;was one of Apple Arcade’s best launch titles, a game that takes the addictive nature of match-three puzzle games and blends it with absolutely brutal fantasy action. Imagine &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; by way of Frank Frazetta. Since then, &lt;em&gt;Grindstone&lt;/em&gt; has received a steady stream of updates that have only improved the experience, with plenty of more levels, weapons, and enemies to keep things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qj09zl"&gt;Reigns: Beyond&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Reigns: Beyond" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjYbrn7lPCiTRn6LbuT_f-xwWyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174650/Reigns_Beyond_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Devolver Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reigns: Beyond &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AoG9kZ"&gt;Across its first few entries, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16743406/reigns-her-majesty-review-iphone-android-steam"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Reigns&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; has been all about exploring stories in a fantasy realm. It plays out sort of like an interactive version of Tinder: as you push through the story, you’re constantly confronted with options, and you either swipe left or right to decide what to do. &lt;em&gt;Reigns: Beyond&lt;/em&gt; takes this same formula and blasts it into space, while also adding a musical element. You’re the captain of a sentient ship, guiding a crew through the cosmos while also booking gigs for your intergalactic rock band. It’s silly and strange, and almost impossible to put down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J9aPEv"&gt;Roundguard&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="roundguard" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ryMb33JbT10TPleSmhQjZSxO_yU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174734/Roundguard_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wonderbelly Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Roundguard&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AGqchY"&gt;The classic puzzle game &lt;em&gt;Peggle&lt;/em&gt; is one that feels timeless, and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178357/roundguard-review-peggle-rpg-switch-xbox-ps4-steam-apple-arcade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roundguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has managed to put a fascinating new spin on the formula. Essentially, the game takes the peg-breaking action and melds it with a fantasy roleplaying game, where you’ll fight monsters and use spells, while still firing little balls to clear out the level. The two elements fit so well together it’s a wonder no one has tried this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lJbojC"&gt;Skate City&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="skate city" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8anVPxu18GYVuL2Jp1g3u1ohCPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174754/02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Snowman&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skate City &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJ4bi"&gt;Skateboarding games were thrust back into the spotlight this year thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4"&gt;the remastered collection of &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;em&gt;Skate City&lt;/em&gt; remains the best approximation of the sport on mobile. It simplifies things, with a side-scrolling perspective and swipe-based controls, but it manages to capture the feeling of exploring a neighborhood in search of new ways to pull off tricks. It has also grown since launch, with the addition of new cities like Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wVopx6"&gt;World’s End Club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="LQm4mZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/orHx-T6WbG0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHSuug"&gt;Famed Japanese writers Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka are known for some incredibly dark games, including the &lt;em&gt;Zero Escape&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Danganronpa&lt;/em&gt; series, and &lt;em&gt;World’s End Club&lt;/em&gt; on Apple Arcade fits into that mold very nicely. At the outset of the game, a small group of students awakens in an underwater amusement park and they all have to fight — or work together — to find a key to escape. The twist is that they only have an hour, and only one person can actually get the key. Imagine &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; as a psychological thriller, and you’re partway there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We deserve The Muppet Great Gatsby</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Muppets promotional still" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFTr37hCLlfjXIDxDRJ0FSFliaw=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68602419/themuppets.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T2qGaz"&gt;When the clock strikes midnight this New Year’s, &lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2021/#fn1text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; and other works copyrighted in 1925 will enter the public domain&lt;/a&gt;, becoming freely available for re-publication and — most importantly — puppet-themed adaptation. More than anything in 2021, I need the Muppet version of &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8JnPo"&gt;Picture this: Kermit in period-specific 1920s dress, playing the mysterious host to a huge party in West Egg. Or Miss Piggy, decked out in flapper regalia, in an abusive relationship with Fozzie Bear as her cruel, philandering husband, Tom Buchanan. There’s obvious aesthetic charms to The Muppets version of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s great American novel, but beyond that, &lt;em&gt;The Muppets’&lt;/em&gt; takes on classic stories are often better. Writers for &lt;a href="https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2019/12/20/a-grand-yuletide-theory-the-muppet-christmas-carol-is-the-best-adaptation-of-a-christmas-carol/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bright Wall/Dark Room&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/21/a-meta-masterpiece-why-the-muppet-christmas-carol-is-the-perfect-festive-film"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have made compelling cases for &lt;em&gt;The Muppet Christmas Carol &lt;/em&gt;as the best adaptation of Charles Dickens’ work and I can’t imagine it would be any different for &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vHqAKG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Look. Listen. Why aren’t there a million muppet remakes of old IP. It’s all anyone wants. It would make literally the entire world happy. It would end hunger and cure several of the more prominent diseases. Jesus would come back just to watch them&lt;/p&gt;— Siobhan Thompson, mysterious European heiress (@vornietom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/1342316456453824514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 25, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rSPoc3"&gt;There’s a real demand for Muppet adaptations and I think the reason is twofold. First, seeing a puppet perform a traditionally human role is inherently funny and second, seeing human emotions in a non-human character allows for new connections to the feelings at the core of these stories: we can often have an easier time finding the humanity in the living toys of &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; than in our own neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpvZmV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Dalloway&lt;/em&gt; and other works’ availability on January 1st, 2021 is actually an adjustment from when they were originally set to become public domain. Thanks to the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 (sometimes called the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” due to &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/08/10/cq/disney.html"&gt;Disney’s lobbying for the bill&lt;/a&gt;), many older titles copyrighted between 1923 and 1977 had 20 years added to their copyright terms. It’s fairly recently that we’re seeing those works enter the public domain again; 2019 was the first year a batch of them became available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7oU2A"&gt;So far, major copyright holders like Disney haven’t managed to convince lawmakers to extend copyright even further. Works published before 1978 are generally now protected for a maximum of 95 years. There’s a whole lot of internet activism that might have kept Disney and co from pushing harder; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/a-whole-years-worth-of-works-just-fell-into-the-public-domain/"&gt;to get the full picture, you should read this &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybrxlHhS3pLr1ssQirx22g10g1Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22205422/SteamboatWillie_mickey_mouse_640x532.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The specific Mickey Mouse that will enter the public domain in 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fyM1rt"&gt;Disney, of course, has a notable copyright coming to its end. The earliest appearances of Mickey Mouse, including the animated short &lt;em&gt;Steamboat Willie&lt;/em&gt;, are set to expire in 2024. It’ll be interesting to see how Disney attempts to protect its claim to Mickey ahead of, and after, that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIqwOx"&gt;Unfortunately, Disney also owns The Muppets, and the earliest copyrights on those characters might not expire until 2050 at the earliest. To actually produce my epic puppet tale of disillusionment with the American Dream would require Disney to dip into the same public domain where it seemingly doesn’t want its own characters to wind up. So for now, it’s probably best to celebrate these works in their original forms, before making harebrained (or genius) plans to elevate them with skilled puppetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVLjwv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This maker built a working Batman grappling gun in only a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gif of Built IRL using his grappling gun" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8qGk1gDehn8BbIrc72axYdBPBU=/22x0:618x397/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68600944/grapple_hook_built_irl.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Built IRL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13SPgQ"&gt;If you’ve ever watched a Batman movie or played &lt;em&gt;Just Cause&lt;/em&gt;, you’ve probably thought “wow, using a grappling hook would be so much fun.” YouTuber Built IRL, whose name is JT, thought so too — and he’s been working on making that happen for the past year. The end result is a grappling hook gun that functions pretty similarly to the ones we’ve seen in movies and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJzYG1"&gt;As you’ll see in the video above, this new grappling gun is more impressive than many previous attempts. For one thing, it’s self-contained — the entire unit fits on his arm, including the CO2-powered blasting mechanism that shoots the hook using standard cartridges, and a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; powerful 10,000W motor that’s properly fast and can completely pull him up into the air. (He shows off some previous historical attempts to build such a gadget, and definitely seems like his hook would win the grappling gun race.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdGkeZ"&gt;Unlike some other DIY grappling hooks, JT’s contraption can also bring him back down to earth. He can control his direction and speed with a wheel near his thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of JT holding his grappling hook device" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MG3LSszW71QqVX_7fIe1k3eUi0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22205647/Screen_Shot_2020_12_30_at_2.00.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Built IRL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty small for a device that can haul a human at such speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UXpLrH"&gt;You can also see some of the real-world limitations of a grapple gun, ones that Batman never had to deal with since he’s a work of fiction. The device can be hard to control — partly because JT’s trying to use his thumb while also supporting all his weight with one hand. For the most part, he uses it attached to a harness, so the impact of being yanked up into the air can be spread across his whole body instead of being dragged by a single arm. (Just thinking about that makes my shoulders hurt.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Nv5UN"&gt;It also turns out that wrapping a grappling hook around whatever you’re trying to climb isn’t as easy as it seems in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Titanfall 2&lt;/em&gt;. That’s especially true when it’s being fired out of something attached to your arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bws1Qx"&gt;Despite the drawbacks, the device still works shockingly well for something so small, and it’s awesome to see a project like this come together. He’s also working on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEcfkcrYBN8"&gt;a version of Spider-Man’s web shooters&lt;/a&gt;, and his success with the grappling gun makes me think he may actually have a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTQnnY"&gt;If you want to see the origins of the project, you can check out the video &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GmtvxAkPJXo"&gt;JT made with Hacksmith Industries&lt;/a&gt; in November 2019. If you want to see the entire build process, you can  also check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMF8JftKd__PAFNXvYrNqqrP0JVF5a4IP"&gt;this playlist of videos detailing the project’s evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ESPN Plus is raising its annual subscription price to $59.99 in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ymr6jaUeCakEmF97qVgzDHbGldE=/0x1:1872x1249/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68600845/Screen_Shot_2020_06_30_at_2.34.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hu2w0C"&gt;The cost for an annual subscription for ESPN Plus subscribers will increase from $49.99 to $59.99 in 2021, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/espn-plus-ufc-price-increase-annual-subscription-1234876797/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ESPN raised the monthly price of ESPN Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308377/espn-plus-price-increase-date-streaming-disney-hulu-annual-membership"&gt;earlier this year to $5.99&lt;/a&gt;, and now the annual subscription is getting the same treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C04Tpy"&gt;New subscribers will start paying $59.99 on January 8th, 2021, and the new price will reportedly trickle down to existing subscribers a few months later in March. Disney had already announced that Disney Plus and the company’s bundle of Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus would each &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165869/disney-price-hike-united-states-bundle"&gt;cost $1 more starting in March 2021&lt;/a&gt;, raising those prices to $8.99 and $13.99, respectively. Streaming price hikes have been a theme of 2020; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV raised its price&lt;/a&gt;, Fubo followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309678/fubo-tv-subscription-price-increase-cost-family-plan-standard-youtube-disney-warnermedia"&gt;not long after&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix raised the cost of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;most popular streaming plan by $1&lt;/a&gt;, and Hulu’s Live TV service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;got a price bump as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLfBI5"&gt;The pricing for ESPN Plus’ UFC pay-per-view events will also change in January. Currently each match costs $64.99 to watch, but after January 8th, that will change to $69.99. UFC pay-per-view matches are exclusive to ESPN Plus in the US, so the price change will affect anyone who keeps up with MMA regularly. Outside the US, the availability of matches varies depending on the region, but the &lt;a href="https://www.ufc.com/events"&gt;official UFC site&lt;/a&gt; has the most up-to-date information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plyQTT"&gt;These kinds of streaming service price hikes aren’t unusual, and if anything it gives some insight into ESPN and Disney’s confidence in their service. There are new ESPN Plus exclusives coming to the service next year, but ESPN’s biggest get is streaming rights to Southeastern Conference football, which &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/espn-sec-sports-rights-deal-cbs-1234851019/"&gt;will bring SEC games to the streaming service in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have to see if these are enough for existing subscribers to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ticketmaster will pay $10 million for hacking rival ticket seller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Entertainment &amp;amp;amp; Tourism Industries In New York City Struggle Under Pandemic Restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBIQxctiuhBuTadijC3TJBeB6p8=/0x17:5325x3567/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68600382/1290806319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CpcWQM"&gt;Ticketmaster has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0"&gt;agreed to pay $10 million&lt;/a&gt; for breaking into a competitors’ network. The company and its parent Live Nation admitted to hiring a former employee from rival ticket seller CrowdSurge, then using his knowledge — including old usernames and passwords — to learn CrowdSurge’s inner workings and “cut [the company] off at the knees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXDJVp"&gt;“Ticketmaster employees repeatedly — and illegally — accessed a competitor’s computers without authorization using stolen passwords to unlawfully collect business intelligence,” said acting US attorney Seth DuCharme. “Further, Ticketmaster’s employees brazenly held a division-wide ‘summit’ at which the stolen passwords were used to access the victim company’s computers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJR0S4"&gt;The hacking allegations were &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/songkick-live-nation-ticketmaster-hacking-1201989759/"&gt;reported in 2017&lt;/a&gt; after CrowdSurge (which had merged with another company called Songkick) sued Live Nation for antitrust violations. &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/press-release/file/1349741/download"&gt;According to court documents&lt;/a&gt; and previous reports, Live Nation hired a former CrowdSurge employee named Stephen Mead in 2013. Then, now-fired Ticketmaster executive Zeeshan Zaidi and other executives encouraged him to turn over his old employer’s secrets. That included logging into pages with analytics for artist management companies, getting a window into CrowdSurge’s operations. Ticketmaster even offered a “product review” of its far smaller rival at a 2014 company summit, asking Mead to log in and demonstrate its capabilities in a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTnAHD"&gt;In addition to actual password theft, Mead also revealed that his old employer used non-protected but difficult-to-find preview links for ticketing pages. Ticketmaster gathered a spreadsheet of every ticketing page it could find, letting it identify artists who were using the service and “dissuade” them from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uhSp8"&gt;Ticketmaster apparently lost access to the system by 2015, the same year CrowdSurge merged with Songkick. Songkick sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster for violating antitrust laws. But it soon sold or shut down its services, and in 2018, it &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/business/media/live-nation-songkick.html"&gt;accepted a $110 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; — plus an undisclosed sum to sell some of its remaining assets to Ticketmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1VqFT"&gt;Ticketmaster expressed satisfaction with the outcome in a statement. “Ticketmaster terminated both Zaidi and Mead in 2017, after their conduct came to light. Their actions violated our corporate policies and were inconsistent with our values. We are pleased that this matter is now resolved,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z52xgC"&gt;Today’s judgment defers prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Ticketmaster must pay the fine in question, maintain clear policies to detect and prevent unauthorized computer intrusion, and present annual reports on its conduct for the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9IsNa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 6:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Ticketmaster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LG Wing’s dual screens get a little easier to use in a new software update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/18gH32jPaBIj0aKdZ6F_toyMqJ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68600137/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLSpKX"&gt;LG’s screen-swiveling Wing was one of the most interesting looking smartphones of 2020, but its unique design was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;held back&lt;/a&gt; by poor software support. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Flg-wing-update%2F%3FAID%3D11365093%26SID%3D76086X1526367X31585b5296a3eb04e20a82fb2646967f%26vendorid%3DCJM%26PUBID%3D100036542%26cjevent%3Dfa23ec194ae411eb821b096f0a24060b%26cjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F30%2F22206901%2Flg-wing-software-update-verizon-dual-screen-apps-media-controls#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A new software update&lt;/a&gt;, out today for the Verizon-exclusive device, looks to help address those issues by adding some new dual-screen functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu6CK7"&gt;Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2020/12/30/verizon-lg-wing-gets-big-update-to-take-advantage-of-its-double-screen-fun/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Droid Life&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new update makes it much easier to send apps to and from the smaller display to the main one (a process that previously involved some convoluted menu wrangling.) With the new update, there’s now a “send” button that shuttle apps from one display to the other, along with a “restart” button to relaunch apps that transition over poorly. You can also use a third-finger gesture to accomplish a similar task. Finally, LG has added app names to the homescreen when the phone is swiveled open, making it better resemble the standard Android homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8uSOyZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG Wing review: learning to fly, failing to soar ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Tdnp0o"&gt;LG has also fixed one of the biggest pet peeves about the second display, adding media controls for all apps to the second display when watching (instead of just a handful of select apps, like YouTube.) Now, apps like Netflix will offer similar functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDHIwt"&gt;There’s also a few other additional features in the update, including the ability to automatically scan QR codes in the camera app, a new wallpaper, a matching 5G icon, and a November security patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MELXe9"&gt;If you own an LG Wing, you’ll be able to install the update now by checking for a software update in the settings app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trade-in site Gazelle is ending trade-ins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bnf7zuGsmcDZfvpAoMyJvczOgGU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68599613/akrales_190914_3628_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ayb8pY"&gt;Gazelle, one of the longest-running used smartphone buyers in the US, has announced the end of its core trade-in program, which let phone owners mail in phones and other electronics devices in exchange for cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw3O0x"&gt;The news, revealed in an email Gazelle sent to some customers on Wednesday and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, means any prospective Gazelle customers will have to receive a quote and initiate the trade-in process by January 31st, 2021 (allowing 30 days to mail in the phone) if they want to take advantage of the program. The service will shut down officially on February 1st, while any active trade-ins will be honored, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Ugn2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gazelle will still accept used smartphones through its ecoATM kiosks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHFO9c"&gt;This isn’t the end of Gazelle’s business. Gazelle’s parent company ecoATM, which has been around since 2006, &lt;a href="https://www.ecoatm.com/a/devices"&gt;operates kiosks&lt;/a&gt; that let you get instant cash for a used device, and the Gazelle website is now used as a retailer for selling those devices at reduced prices after they’re then refurbished. (The catch is that ecoATMs may not pay out as much as the traditional Gazelle mail-in program, which typically has offered more than $300 or so for a prior year’s flagship like the iPhone 11 Pro.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTva5M"&gt;Gazelle doesn’t give a reason for the decision, but there are a few major trends in the US mobile business that point toward a general decline in the benefits of cash trade-in services. For one, many more people now than in years past lease their smartphones instead of buying them outright, a broad shift from the days when US carriers offered reduced price phones in exchange for firm two-year contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbPuot"&gt;Now, it’s quite easy to pay a modest monthly fee for a phone through a program like AT&amp;amp;T Next Up or Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program, with the option to trade that device in for a new one after a designated amount of time. Unless you decide to pay off your leased phone early, you can’t turn around and sell it to Gazelle — and you wouldn’t necessarily want to do that as it doesn’t make much financial sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7WgfZ"&gt;Additionally, Gazelle’s early business boomed on iPhone trade-ins back when selling your phone to get the latest Apple product was a popular strategy for early adopters. Now, Apple has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in%3Fafid%3Dp238%257Cs4wibFo6O-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_427418702567_pgrid_80259604234_%26cid%3Daos-us-kwgo-brand--slid---product-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F30%2F22206779%2Fgazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;robust trade-in program of its own&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to the leasing program) that pretty much gets you the same result. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metro: Last Light Redux is free on GOG</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gallery Photo: Metro: Last Light screens" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1erKwqCLH7bwrJdkYJY_gD9wbGU=/86x0:1015x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68599607/METRO-LL-E3-2012-ONLINE-2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJ3ohH"&gt;If you’ve never gotten around to buying and playing &lt;em&gt;Metro: Last Light&lt;/em&gt;, the remastered version is &lt;a href="https://www.gog.com"&gt;free on the GOG store&lt;/a&gt; today and tomorrow (&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/30/22206196/free-games-metro-last-light-cd-projekt"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The game has been out for a while now, but it’s still as terrifying as ever, even if you’re playing it for a second or third time. And, when you get a game from GOG, it comes without any DRM, so your copy of the game isn’t tied to any particular platform. You can download the files to your hard drive, and it’ll still run without GOG’s launcher installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IelMzT"&gt;The process of claiming the game is a little non-obvious, as the “&lt;em&gt;Metro: Last Light&lt;/em&gt; giveaway” link at the very top of the page just leads to GOG’s search screen. To claim the free game, you’ll first want to log in (or create an account if you don’t have one), then go to the homepage. Scroll down until you see banner with a button that says “Yes, and claim the game”. The “yes”, by the way, is you opting in to marketing emails from GOG, so be aware of that before clicking. Clicking the button should add the game to your library, where you can then go and download it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot from the GOG website showing the claim game button" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWiISaTacNpKVq2WmkveDGV-seE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22204877/Screen_Shot_2020_12_30_at_10.11.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That big green button is the only thing you can click that will actually get you the game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9GTdJA"&gt;Offering a free, genuinely very good game may be an attempt by GOG’s owner, CD Projekt Red to try to earn back some of the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22178913/cyberpunk-2077-launch-controversy-cd-projekt"&gt;goodwill that it’s lost this month&lt;/a&gt;. The company has been dealing with the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22178913/cyberpunk-2077-launch-controversy-cd-projekt"&gt;botched release of Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a PR crisis concerning GOG itself: there are concerns by some that the company capitulated to the Chinese government by rolling back its decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178453/gog-devotion-cancels-release-cd-projekt-red"&gt;carry Red Candle Games’s &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which contained unflattering references to the Chinese president in an early version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E28kKC"&gt;If you’ve decided not to use CD Projekt Red’s services for whatever reason, and don’t mind the game being stuck on a single platform, you can still pick it up pretty cheap on Steam — &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/287390/Metro_Last_Light_Redux/"&gt;it’ll be $3.99 there&lt;/a&gt; until January 5th. No matter which platform you pick, &lt;em&gt;Metro: Last Light&lt;/em&gt; is a great game with a solid story — and a lot of tense and heart-pounding moments. I played it when I was admittedly maybe a bit too young, and it resulted in a fair share of nightmares, so it may not be for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8TXj3"&gt;If you’re itching for more free games, &lt;em&gt;Torchlight II&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/torchlight-2/home"&gt;free on the Epic Games Store today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maneater and the latest Tomb Raider are among the latest free games for PS Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shadow of the Tomb Raider" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aO2QvLJwBGdSGnOil7JElxyVoPo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68598791/sottr_review02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vS1H2R"&gt;Sony has &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/12/30/januarys-playstation-plus-games-maneater-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-and-greedfall/"&gt;announced its January lineup of games&lt;/a&gt; that are free for PS Plus subscribers to download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce5F3B"&gt;Starting January 5th, you’ll be able to get the PS5-only version of &lt;em&gt;Maneater&lt;/em&gt;, the eat-em-up game that &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;’s Chris Plante described &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/5/22/21266348/maneater-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;in his entertaining review&lt;/a&gt; as “the best shark game... ever?”, as well as two other PS4 games, &lt;em&gt;Greedfall &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;both of which are playable on PS5. Unfortunately, the PS4 version of &lt;em&gt;Maneater &lt;/em&gt;isn’t available for people who haven’t yet made the jump to the PS5, so PS4 owners get just two games this month. This bundle will no longer be available after February 1st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx7tso"&gt;It seems like Sony has established a formula for its monthly batch of complimentary games, with one PS5 game serving as the highlight and two PS4 games to round it out (and to keep doling out some small gifts for people who don’t yet have a PS5). Speaking of PS5 games, go ahead and download &lt;em&gt;Bugsnax &lt;/em&gt;for free while you can. It will no longer be available as a perk for PS Plus subscribers after January 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arTvzF"&gt;We don’t usually know what will be in each monthly collection of games, but Sony has already shared that its &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534475/destruction-all-stars-ps5-launch-title-delayed-ps-plus-february-2021"&gt;the vehicular combat game that was delayed past the console’s launch date&lt;/a&gt;, will be February’s freebie for the PS5. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon buys Wondery, setting itself up to compete against Spotify for podcast domination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gO-hNwecce3wxvQIJ8p4UM14fP0=/0x0:2342x1561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68598739/amazonwondery.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJEZtt"&gt;Wondery, one of the last major independent podcast networks, might soon be owned by Amazon. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/wondery-to-join-amazon-music"&gt;announced an acquisition deal&lt;/a&gt; today, ending speculation about who might eventually buy the network, which is most well-known for true crime podcasts like &lt;em&gt;Dirty John&lt;/em&gt;. (Apple and Sony were also reported to have at least discussed a possible purchase.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwEFhv"&gt;Amazon didn’t disclose the acquisition price, although earlier reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/apple-sony-said-to-hold-talks-about-buying-podcaster-wondery"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-in-talks-to-buy-podcast-maker-wondery-11606931396?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested Wondery’s value was at least $300 million. Wondery would technically be part of Amazon Music, which launched podcast support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439531/amazon-music-podcasts-prime-titles"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; this year. Wondery CEO Hernan Lopez will step down and leave the company when the deal closes, and COO Jen Sargent will take over, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenMullin/status/1344374604987576321"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ben Mullin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QD3Pf7"&gt;The acquisition is a notable one, if only because it sets Amazon up to better compete against Spotify, which has been acquiring networks and exclusive talent for over a year. Amazon says this Wondery deal doesn’t change existing shows — they’ll still be available through “a variety of providers.” But Amazon says it hopes buying Wondery will “accelerate the growth and evolution of podcasts by bringing creators, hosts, and immersive experiences to even more listeners across the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0b9PD"&gt;Of course, Amazon Music would likely promote Wondery shows over other programs and possibly put even more marketing spend behind them, especially globally. Interestingly, Audible isn’t mentioned in the news release, even though the Amazon-owned company creates its own &lt;a href="https://chorus.voxmedia.com/compose/feed584f-0b76-4a54-b052-f58a32ffe942"&gt;exclusive podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as publicly available ones, and recently launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398875/audible-plus-premium-subscription-membership-plan-credit"&gt;a cheaper price tier&lt;/a&gt; specifically for people who might want to hear Audible exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UswHds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 12/30, 1:29 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story previously stated that Wondery is now owned by Amazon, but the deal has not yet closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnbgn4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12/30, 3:13 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that Hernan Lopez will leave Wondery when the deal closes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
