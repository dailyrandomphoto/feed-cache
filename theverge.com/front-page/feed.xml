    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix and a famed film author already optioned movies about GameStop, Reddit and Wall Street</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3XGClZ8xlrF8jJsLXChkUo-P9M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754168/acastro_210128_1777_stonks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgKD6z"&gt;It looks like we’ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to movies about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;WallStreetBets / GameStop saga&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that both &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/mgm-ben-mezrichs-the-antisocial-network-wall-street-1234684378/"&gt;MGM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; have plans to make one, before the dust has even settled (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/someone-already-sold-the-movie-rights-to-an-unpublished-1846173930"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/1/22260573/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-wallstreetbets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you weren't paying attention to the stock-spikes, short squeezes, and diamond hands that were going on last week, we have an explainer that should &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2p85ltIvg"&gt;get you caught up on the big picture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlksSW"&gt;MGM’s version of the movie is set to based as a book that hasn’t yet been written. The author of that book is Ben Mezrich, who wrote &lt;em&gt;The Accidental Billionaires&lt;/em&gt;, which was the basis for David Fincher’s 2010 movie &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt;. Mezrich was apparently inspired by Fincher’s title, as he’s calling his new book &lt;em&gt;The Antisocial Network&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeAEAF"&gt;Netflix is trying to get Mark Boal, the screenwriter and a producer on &lt;em&gt;The Hurt Locker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Detroit&lt;/em&gt;, to write its adaptation. (Does this mean we could see Kathryn Bigelow directing? Please say yes.) The company is also planning on having &lt;em&gt;To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before &lt;/em&gt;star &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;Noah Centineo play a major role&lt;/a&gt;. Who he’ll be depicting is anyone’s guess, because the story literally isn’t done unfolding in real life yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZK6CWZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trading on Robinhood is a big part of the story, but is hard to show on screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP7gMd"&gt;I can imagine it’s hard to be a movie producer tasked with turning the WallStreetBets story into a movie, because on one hand you want to get it done ASAP so the movie is still topical, but on the other you have to wait until the story is done before you can really start working on it. Even now we’re seeing new developments as WallStreetBets starts &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-day-traders-are-moving-into-spacs-11612175401"&gt;to target SPACs&lt;/a&gt; (shell companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;meant to help private companies easily&lt;/a&gt; go public) and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-users-fuel-rally-in-silver-11612182810"&gt;silver commodities&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a tragedy if a movie didn’t include a scene of a Redditor having to take delivery of 300 bars of silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twMG8s"&gt;There’s also the question of how big a role trading platform Robinhood will play in the movies. The platform created a firestorm of controversy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;user anger&lt;/a&gt; when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;halted the buying of WallStreetBets’s favorite stocks&lt;/a&gt; last week, but &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; reports that the app is &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/02/01/exclusive-robinhood-secures-another-1-billion-in-funds-and-is-in-talks-for-more-as-downloads-hit-record-1-million-per-day/?sh=309e88133005"&gt;still getting a million downloads a day&lt;/a&gt;. It’s something that would be hard to put into a movie, but is obviously a big part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFHEGG"&gt;Neither movie has a release date yet (again, because it’s hard to tell when this whole thing will be over), or much talent attached to speak of, but I’m excited to see how they turn out. Hopefully one of these adaptations could be like &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;, staring Michael Cera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256582/roaringkitty-deepfuckingvalue-keith-gill-profile-gamestop-wallstreetbets-wsj"&gt;as u/DeepFuckingValue&lt;/a&gt;, and, if I’m really dreaming here, maybe they’ll both be released the same week like Netflix and Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.tvguide.com/news/which-fyre-fest-documentary-should-you-watch-hulu-netflix/"&gt;competing Fyre Festival documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. Such weirdness would only be fitting for the absolute roller coaster that the GameStop stock ride has been, and will likely continue to be. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood plummets back down to a one-star rating on Google Play</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7uVx_o8szn2-m64q0PBZwZt_FHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754061/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S9L3Nl"&gt;Investment app Robinhood has plummeted back down to a one-star rating on Google Play, thanks to a flood of thousands of new negative reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhbLzV"&gt;The latest low rating comes just days after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;salvaged the app’s rating&lt;/a&gt; by removing nearly 100,000 reviews, following a flood of negative ratings after the Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;blocked purchases of popular stocks&lt;/a&gt; from Reddit’s /r/WallStreetBets like GameStop or AMC last week. Google confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that it was actively removing negative reviews on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RliLVA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="E6itFZ"&gt;The review rollercoaster for Robinhood’s rating has been nearly as up-and-down as GameStop’s stock price. When users began to review bomb the app last Thursday, Robinhood reached a one-star rating with nearly 275,000 reviews. Google then removed nearly 100,000 of those reviews, putting the app back at a four-star average with roughly 180,000 reviews. But as of the publication of this article, Robinhood has returned to a new high of almost 305,000 reviews, along with a 1.1-star rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ok4qiB"&gt;Google’s Play Store policies &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/comment-posting-policy/"&gt;do explicitly ban reviews&lt;/a&gt; that are intended to “manipulate the rating” of an app; the company had previously removed earlier Robinhood reviews because it felt that they violated that policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru3iN8"&gt;A Google spokesperson did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the current reviews — which were not the ones deleted in last week’s purge — are compliant to Google’s policies, and won’t be removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vADLp3"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google commented that &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Google Play’s app review systems are designed to provide a genuine and trustworthy view of an app’s user experience, and we take action on any inauthentic or coordinated activity aimed at artificially raising or lowering an app’s overall score. To be clear, this is not done to shield an app from negative reviews, but to help protect app developers from things like coordinated review bombing and to safeguard our systems from being artificially manipulated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMTDRH"&gt;The low review rating is one that’s unique to Google’s Play Store, at least for now. The iOS version of Robinhood still boasts a 4.0-star rating on Apple’s storefront, although there has been an uptick of negative reviews in the past few days for that version of the app, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood is facing dozens of lawsuits over GameStop stock freeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcsqg09BnQMGq0l-LnrqEjemXa0=/0x0:4015x2677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68754001/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jNSFJi"&gt;Stock trading app Robinhood is facing dozens of lawsuits after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;restricted several stocks&lt;/a&gt; popular on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. At least 30 parties across 10 states have sued the company in federal court, many seeking class action status. They allege that Robinhood users lost millions of dollars because they were unable to buy or sell stock during the freeze, and that the company chose to “manipulate the market” to help other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w824Bt"&gt;Robinhood, which bills itself as a democratizing force in the stock market, helped facilitate an unprecedented boom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;around a handful of “meme stocks”&lt;/a&gt; last month. But on January 28th, it infuriated users by freezing trades on several of these stocks. That included GameStop ($GME) as well as AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ($BBBY), and Nokia ($NOK). The company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility"&gt;defended the move&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post, calling it a “risk-management decision” undertaken in the face of “extraordinary circumstances.” The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;denied reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had sold some users’ shares without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XY3Dg1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood says it restricted trading under “extraordinary circumstances”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ghlqT"&gt;The answer didn’t satisfy users. Robinhood user Brendon Nelson &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.553175/gov.uscourts.nysd.553175.1.0_3.pdf"&gt;filed the first lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in New York state that day, accusing the company of negligence and breaching its contract with traders. More suits have followed, spread across courts in New Jersey, California, Texas, Florida, and other states. Some plaintiffs simply complain about missing a potential windfall, but others lay out more specific damages: Patryk Krasowski of Illinois, for instance, claims he lost $220,000 because Robinhood wouldn’t let him exercise GameStop purchase options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69II79"&gt;“Robinhood has completely blocked retailer investors from purchasing [GameStop stock] for no legitimate reason,” reads Nelson’s complaint. It claims Robinhood “failed to provide adequate explanation” about pulling a profitable stock from its platform and “knowingly put their customers at a disadvantage compared to customers who used other trading apps.” Robinhood has lifted the blanket freeze on GameStop and other stocks, but it’s maintained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;strict trading limits&lt;/a&gt; for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S0Zkky"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An unrelated class action lawsuit was certified last week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YaMCwG"&gt;Nelson requested that courts force Robinhood to reinstate full access to trading GameStop stock, in addition to paying financial damages for any Robinhood users who were unable to execute GameStop stock trades. Other parties made similar pleas, and several are seeking class action status. Some suits also targeted other institutions, including the financial services companies &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/"&gt;Citadel Securities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-trading-restrictions-blamed-on-wall-streets-clearing-firm-by-online-broker-11611867105"&gt;Apex Clearing&lt;/a&gt;, which have worked with Robinhood to execute trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmdTQF"&gt;The cases were filed only days ago, and they may not be heard until the GameStop stock bubble has deflated. While a Washington judge did&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;certify a class action suit against Robinhood last week, that case &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16464992/parties/gordon-v-robinhood-financial-llc/"&gt;dates to 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/tcpa/1006590-robinhood-class-action-lawsuit-certified-over-refer-a-friend-texts-washington-state/"&gt;concerned the app’s&lt;/a&gt; “refer a friend” program. &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-furious-robinhood-users-are-suing-but-theres-potentially-a-big-road-block-in-their-way-to-court-11611950777"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, any lawsuit might also be stymied by Robinhood’s arbitration clause — a section of the user agreement that demands conflicts be settled out of court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3Fboh"&gt;Disgruntled users aren’t the only threat for Robinhood, however. The company’s decision drew bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and others &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;calling to investigate the company’s decision&lt;/a&gt;. And CEO Vlad Tenev is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/01/robinhood-ceo-testify-maxine-waters-464491"&gt;expected to testify&lt;/a&gt; in a February 18th hearing before the House Financial Services Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX announces first ‘all-civilian’ mission to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHrFBJOXCs7kIyOJq0lE-KxBkBk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753590/elon_musk_tesla_3036.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oow6VM"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is planning to send its first “all-civilian” crew to space at the end of 2021 in a charity-focused mission commanded by tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The company said in a press release it’ll pick three people to ride alongside Isaacman to orbit aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CisNc"&gt;Isaacman, a trained pilot and the chief executive of Shift4 Payments, said he donated $100 million to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and wants to help raise $200 million more by inviting people to donate at least $10 to St. Jude for a chance to get picked. Three people will be chosen “to represent the mission pillars of leadership, hope, generosity and prosperity,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005905/en/World%E2%80%99s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space-Will-Usher-in-New-Era-of-Commercial-Space-Exploration"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; — though one person was already picked, Isaacman said during a press call on Monday. The full crew “will be announced in the weeks ahead,” SpaceX said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDogwm"&gt; “This is an important milestone towards enabling access to space for everyone,” Musk told reporters on the call, adding that it’s part of SpaceX’s broader goal to “bring the cost down over time and make space accessible to all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAcrMZ"&gt;The mission, named Inspiration4, will launch from SpaceX’s 39A launch site at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop the company’s Falcon 9 rocket. Prior to flight, crew members will get special training from SpaceX with “a specific focus on orbital mechanics, operating in microgravity, zero gravity, and other forms of stress testing.” The four-person crew will spend up to five days in the acorn-shaped Crew Dragon capsule as it orbits Earth every 90 minutes “along a customized flight path,” SpaceX and the contest’s official rules said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdX7OL"&gt;“The mission parameters are up to Jared,” Musk said. The mission could last anywhere from two to four days long, “but if you wanna stay up longer that’s fine too,” he added. Musk and Isaacman offered scant details on the kind of training the crew members will go through, but it’ll be long enough for the participants — three strangers — to get to know each other before spending a few days confined to Crew Dragon’s tight cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGVBTg"&gt;“We are all going to know each other incredibly well, long before we ever strapped into Dragon, I can promise you that,” Isaacman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UF4hO3"&gt;Crew members must be “physically and psychologically fit for training,” under 6 feet and 6 inches tall and weigh less than 250 pounds, per the fundraiser’s official rules (a person who’s able to ride the Incredible Hulk roller coaster in Florida would be a perfect fit, Musk said). If the mission gets delayed past 2022, crew members will each get an “alternate prize” of $150,000, the fine print added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiFhRq"&gt;SpaceX has launched two crews to space already, but those were with trained NASA astronauts — including one astronaut from Japan’s space agency — on government-funded trips to the International Space Station. The Inspiration4 mission marks SpaceX’s latest private astronaut mission to be announced: The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;Ax-1 mission&lt;/a&gt;, also planned for the end of 2021, hosts a crew of four private astronauts paying $55 million each for an eight-day trip to the ISS. And in 2018 Elon Musk announced Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa will hitch a ride around the moon on SpaceX’s new rocket system Starship, which is in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLHuGZ"&gt;SpaceX developed its Crew Dragon capsule with a more than $2 billion contract under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, the agency’s initiative to spur private spacecraft development. Kathy Lueders, who led the crew program and is currently NASA’s human spaceflight chief, tweeted after the Inspiration4 reveal on Monday she was “excited to see one of the original goals of @Commercial_Crew come to be with the expansion of new commercial activities beyond our own in low-Earth orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JokAlA"&gt;Isaacman told reporters the mission kicks off the biggest fundraiser ever for St. Jude, a children’s hospital with an already massive fundraising reach. “If we’re going to continue making advances up there in space, then we have an obligation to do the same down here on Earth,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Donald Trump’s Twitter Account Suspended" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJ135c4NSdZq0GgUYH-Awe5eA6g=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753500/1230490709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZuAdEy"&gt;A new report finds that claims of anti-conservative bias on social media platforms are not only untrue but serve as a form of disinformation. The &lt;a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/bias-report-release-page"&gt;report from NYU’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; says not only is there no empirical finding that social media companies systematically suppress conservatives, but even reports of anecdotal instances tend to fall apart under close scrutiny. And in an effort to appear unbiased, platforms actually bend over backward to try to appease conservative critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtqBd"&gt;“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yetijO"&gt;The researchers analyzed data from analytics platforms CrowdTangle and NewsWhip and existing reports like the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/26/censorship-conservatives-social-media-432643"&gt;2020 study from Politico&lt;/a&gt; and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, all of which showed that conservative accounts actually dominated social media. And they drilled down into anecdotes about bias and repeatedly found there was no concrete evidence to support such claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceJWs8"&gt;Looking at how claims of anti-conservative bias developed over time, Barrett says, it’s not hard to see how the “anti-conservative” rhetoric became a political instrument. “It’s a tool used by everyone from Trump to Jim Jordan to Sean Hannity, but there is no evidence to back it up,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUG3Yf"&gt;The report notes that the many lawsuits against social media platforms have “failed to present substantial evidence of ideological favoritism — and they have all been dismissed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BEJlZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Twitter was taking the lead and setting the example.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFjffq"&gt;This is not to suggest that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and others have not made mistakes, Barrett added; they have. “They tend to react to crises and adjust their policies in the breach, and that’s led to a herky-jerky cadence of how they apply their policies,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6exNGz"&gt;Twitter in particular has historically been more hands-off with moderation, proud of its image as a protector of free speech. But all that changed in 2020, Barrett said, in response to the pandemic and the anticipation that there would be a bitter election campaign cycle. “Twitter shifted its policies and began much more vigorous policing of content around the pandemic and voting in general,” he notes. Among social media companies, “Twitter was taking the lead and setting the example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uK0jkY"&gt;And in the aftermath of the January 6th riots at the Capitol, Barrett says, Twitter and other platforms were well within their policies against inciting violence when they banned former President Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDGKY0"&gt;The report has several recommendations for social media platforms going forward. First: better disclosure around content moderation decisions, so the public has a fuller understanding of why certain content and users might be removed. The report authors also want platforms to allow users to customize and control their social media feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gf5IRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NVpfOZ"&gt;Hiring more human moderators is another key recommendation, and Barrett acknowledges that the job of content moderator is highly stressful. But having more moderators — hired as employees, not contractors — would allow Facebook and other platforms to spread out moderation of the most challenging content among more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2UsS6"&gt;The report also recommends Congress and the White House work with tech companies to dial back some of the hostility between Washington and Silicon Valley and work on responsible regulation. He doesn’t recommend repealing Section 230, however. Instead, he’d like to see it amended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWnhez"&gt;“Make it conditional: If companies want to enjoy the benefits of 230, they need to adopt responsible content moderation policies. Let people see how their algorithms work, and why certain people see material others don’t,” he said. “No one expects them to show every last line of code, but people should be able to understand what goes into the decisions being made about what they’re seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjP1rB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e81ZDm"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This DIY project turns an iPod into a click wheel-powered Spotify player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY1430B9FKY0A7KtQXj_959cF0c=/0x6:2995x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753287/9709381611420439726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Guy Dupont&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23TvnZ"&gt;Classic iPods have their fans, but they’re not built for the modern age of music streaming — except for this one, which has been turned into a Spotify player by tinkerer Guy Dupont. While it may look like an iPod from the outside, inside, it’s got a Raspberry Pi loaded with software custom-built by Dupont to interface with Spotify, while still keeping the classic iPod style. He calls it the sPot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y7175"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxdhG1OhVng"&gt;In a video&lt;/a&gt; showing off the project and the process behind it, Dupont says he was inspired when his mother-in-law gifted him the old iPod. In a Hackaday post, he says he “had forgotten how good it feels to hold and use one of these things,” but he wanted to update it with some modern features, including (obviously) Spotify streaming, Bluetooth audio, and search. That’s right, the device can search the entirety of Spotify’s library and stream it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFW7-qaIEFCta6y5s_r9cj4UG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273865/2933361611439284872.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don’t need an iTunes library where we’re going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2VdATS"&gt;Dupont put a Raspberry Pi Zero W inside the iPod because Spotify requires an internet connection — something most iPods don’t support. It also allows for the custom interface and Bluetooth audio. The sPot also needs a larger battery to power the Pi, but all of the hardware still fits inside the original iPod case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T72aeRI-CMGagutYMdzweASWZXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273841/9709381611420439726.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPod on the outside...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zvjb6mT4-eM7h5hzKIb-u3foW-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273833/461361611420741157.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...all custom on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gw7DaV"&gt;Dupont was able to keep the scroll wheel interface — and he even managed to improve it. There’s now haptic feedback when scrolling, instead of just the audible click. But while many of the original buttons are present, they haven't all been as faithfully preserved as the click wheel has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSir5i"&gt;The hold switch now controls the power, instead of locking the iPod to prevent pocket-scrolling. And while the headphone jack is still there, it no longer does anything (RIP to a real one), as audio output is handled by Bluetooth. It also ditches the original 30-pin connector for an easier-to-find-in-2021 Micro USB port that handles charging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFbXrN7X-i1h8z8a2EyMJhvDLCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273871/Screen_Shot_2021_02_01_at_11.22.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphone jack is now just for decoration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gif of Dupont using the scroll wheel to navigate his custom interface" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbSQMYwkFGknK6wEyXtEKNzhInk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273830/2384981611437343326.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That beautiful scroll wheel action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zKddII"&gt;If you wanted to make one of these yourself, Dupont has &lt;a href="https://github.com/dupontgu/retro-ipod-spotify-client"&gt;posted all of the code you’ll need on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. He also &lt;a href="https://hackaday.io/project/177034-spot-spotify-in-a-4th-gen-ipod-2004"&gt;created a Hackaday page&lt;/a&gt; detailing the other software that’s needed to get Spotify working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pa3ExI"&gt;If you’re like me and are wishing for your own sPot, the video should give you pretty much all you need to get started. Doing the quickest of searches for the parts he’s listed, the project will cost around $100, plus the price of the iPod if you don’t already have one. But even if you have no desire to make one of these, the video is totally worth a watch just to experience the glory of what a modern iPod could look like and to see this really cool project come together. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus is getting a Wakanda show from the director of Black Panther</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tpEwkrWubWu2pUophQ-rHBaLyfw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753255/BlackPanther596d2f166e594_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt Kennedy / Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MHzoAh"&gt;Writer-director Ryan Coogler is making a new Marvel TV show for Disney Plus that will be set in the Kingdom of Wakanda as part of a five-year TV exclusivity deal with Coogler’s production banner, Proximity Media (which includes principals Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian, Ludwig Göransson, Archie Davis, and Peter Nicks alongside Coogler himself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKE9nl"&gt;Coogler — who directed and co-wrote Black Panther, and is set to write and direct a sequel &lt;em&gt;Black Panther II&lt;/em&gt; for release on July 8th, 2022 — will develop the new Wakanda Disney Plus series as his first project under the new deal, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/black-panther-ryan-coogler-wakanda-series-disney-plus-exclusive-disney-television-deal-proximity-media-1234684707/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaH3Ca"&gt;The deal with Proximity Media also includes the option to create shows for other parts of the Disney banner, not just Marvel Studios. According to Coogler, “We’re already in the mix on some projects that we can’t wait to share.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CtjIXL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wakanda is heading to Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jcFTFx"&gt;There’s little information on the new Wakanda show itself, but presumably the show will continue to build on the foundation that Coogler has set with both Black Panther and the upcoming sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3lCzC"&gt;Whenever it does arrive, though, Coogler’s Wakanda series will mark the latest in an almost dizzying number of TV shows that are planned for Disney Plus. The streaming service has already kicked off its run of Marvel Studios shows with &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, which is currently airing. It’ll be followed shortly after by &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Solider&lt;/em&gt; in March, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; in May, along with &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, and the animated &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wy4Yl0"&gt;Other already announced shows include &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; She-Hulk, The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ironheart&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Armor Wars&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; I Am Groot&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;all of which are slated to arrive on Disney Plus in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rDQPPs"&gt;Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) issued a joint statement Monday saying they would work together to advance comprehensive cannabis reform legislation in the current Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWSCN1"&gt;“The War on Drugs has been a war on people—particularly people of color. Ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war and end decades of harm inflicted on communities of color across the country. But that alone is not enough,” they said. “As states continue to legalize marijuana, we must also enact measures that will lift up people who were unfairly targeted in the War on Drugs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyQaG4"&gt;All three senators have previously supported legislation to decriminalize cannabis in some form. Schumer &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marijuana%20Freedom%20and%20Opportunity%20Act.pdf"&gt;co-sponsored legislation to decriminalize cannabis&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 &lt;a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/"&gt;and said in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; that he was working on a new federal marijuana legalization bill that would let states decide what to do and would take tax revenues from marijuana and put them toward investing in minority communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIpi08"&gt;“We are committed to working together to put forward and advance comprehensive cannabis reform legislation that will not only turn the page on this sad chapter in American history, but also undo the devastating consequences of these discriminatory policies,” the statement from the three senators reads. “The Senate will make consideration of these reforms a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqu0Wu"&gt;It’s still not totally clear whether President Biden has prioritized marijuana reform, while he was once a leader in the War on Drugs of the 1980s and ’90s, he said during his presidential campaign that he would support rescheduling cannabis to make it legal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jvx4d1"&gt;During the last Congress, the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/04/house-poised-to-vote-to-decriminalize-marijuana/"&gt;passed the MORE Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would have legalized marijuana and expunged the criminal records of people convicted of marijuana-related crimes. The legislation died in the Republican-controlled Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="06CYHA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Will Democrats keep their promise to decriminalize marijuana?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X4L6sj"&gt;Wyden, who is now chairman of the Senate finance committee, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/senate-democrats-marijuana-legislation-456074"&gt;said in November&lt;/a&gt; that he had a bill ready to go called the Marijuana Revenue and Regulation Act, which outlines a taxation and regulation structure for marijuana products.  And Booker &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/cory-booker-introduces-bill-to-legalize-marijuana-nationwide.html"&gt;introduced a bill in 2019&lt;/a&gt; — the Marijuana Justice Act — to legalize marijuana on a national level, with a focus on expunging federal convictions for marijuana use and possession and reinvesting in communities hardest hit by the War on Drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keu6gs"&gt;“In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations,” the three senators said. “Getting input from stakeholder groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ni0n3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 1st, 4:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added detail about the MORE Act and Sen. Booker’s legislation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ytZSUz"&gt;Sony’s reboot of &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most popular first-party exclusives released on PS4, is getting an update tomorrow, which will allow the 2018 hit to take advantage of the PS5’s hardware, Sony’s Santa Monica Studio announced in &lt;a href="https://sms.playstation.com/stories/enhanced-performance-experience-playstation-5-god-of-war-2018"&gt;a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFue1t"&gt;The new update will allow early adopters of the PlayStation 5 to run the game in 4K resolution and at 60 frames per second. If you own a PS4 copy digitally or physically, you will receive the update at no additional cost. Santa Monica Studio also announced today that users who downloaded &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; via the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt; will have access to the PS5 optimization patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qtYbfg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLB6WC"&gt;The blog post also mentions that PS5 owners will have access to the original PS4 graphics by selecting “Original Performance Experience,” which will run the game in 4K resolution but at 30fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVsIC0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is not the only PS4 exclusive to receive a next-gen focused update. Sucker Punch Productions' latest title, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553494/sony-playstation-5-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-digital-foundry"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;, also received a PS5-optimized patched&lt;/a&gt; last year, allowing the game to run at 60fps if you own a PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
