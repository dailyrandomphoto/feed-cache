    <title>Google Calendar will let you record where you’re working to help organize office meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCvwZf1TX_biHQYQl6LYQ61tgB8=/9x0:504x330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751664/Onboarding_dialog.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Set your working location to make scheduling easier.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5O4wR"&gt;Google is adding an option to its Calendar service to let you show where you’re working on any given day of the week, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/share-where-youre-working-from-in.html"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The feature will start rolling out from August 30th for users on select Google Workspace plans, and will be accessible via Calendar’s settings menu alongside its existing working hours options, as well as on the weekly calendar view below where it shows each day’s dates. Available work locations include “Office,” “Home,” “Unspecified,” or “Somewhere else.”    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXpiyc"&gt;According to Google, the option is being added so it’s “easier to plan in-person collaboration or set expectations in a hybrid workplace.” It follows a surge in the popularity of home and hybrid working due to the pandemic. This has meant employees increasingly have to keep track not just of people’s working hours, but also their location, when planning in-person meetings and other events. Google Calendar’s new feature should help here. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HrHrFPPEfVXAF8jWS4GMAeDG1C8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794459/Working_location_in_calendar.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working locations can be edited from the calendar view (pictured) or settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kI25m1"&gt;Google says the new working locations feature will be switched off by default, but users will have the option of enabling it after it starts to roll out at the end of the month. The feature will be available across the following tiers: Google Workspace Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, Nonprofits, and G Suite Business. However it won’t be available for G Suite Basic customers, as well as customers on the Google Workspace Essentials, Business Starter, Enterprise Essentials, and Education Fundamentals plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epomaker AK84S review: a great wireless keyboard, plus some quirks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Overloaded with features&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Z7XMFi"&gt;When it comes to mechanical keyboards, you generally have the option of playing it safe with a major brand like Corsair or Razer, or buying from smaller enthusiast manufacturers with more interesting designs and often more affordable prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utxAly"&gt;Of the two groups, Epomaker definitely falls into the latter. Its recent AK84S wireless keyboard isn’t something you’re going to be able to buy off the shelf from Best Buy, and as yet it’s not listed on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/EF6D975C-83A8-4D76-8F75-3CC54819E1A3"&gt;Amazon storefront&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, after recently being funded via a &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epomaker/epomaker-ak84-aluminum-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now available to preorder directly from &lt;a href="https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-ak84s-1"&gt;Epomaker’s own site&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it’s focusing on shipping keyboards to its Kickstarter backers for now before moving on to orders made via its website in mid- to late September. Shipping can take anywhere from one to two weeks, depending on which method you choose, Epomaker says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcUCD8"&gt;So yes, the Epomaker AK84S isn’t a keyboard you can impulse buy and expect to be clacking away on within 24 hours, and it suffers from a lack of documentation and baffling companion software. But it also has a starting price of just $89 and offers one of the nicest typing experiences I’ve had from a mechanical keyboard. On balance, I think it’s a price worth paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ip2T4z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10709205"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGdujQ"&gt;Epomaker’s AK84S is available in a wide variety of different configurations, so much so that it’s almost impossible to list every one. As of this writing, however, the cheapest configuration on Epomaker’s website appears to be the version with optical switches, ABS keycaps, and an aluminum frame paired with a plastic case, which comes in at a price of $89. If you want other options, like supposedly more durable PBT keycaps (more on this in a bit), mechanical rather than optical switches, or a fully aluminum case, then you can pay as much as $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAFCmZ"&gt;Switch options include an array of optical or mechanical Gateron-produced Cherry MX clones, including reds, blues, blacks, browns, yellows, silvers, greens, and whites (some have an additional $5 fee). Epomaker also has its own Chocolate-branded switches available with this board, which unfortunately I wasn’t able to try out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6JLJt"&gt;For this review, I’ve been using an AK84S with a full aluminum frame, PBT keycaps with the panda design, and clicky blue Gateron switches. You’ll see in the pictures that my model came with a purple case, which isn’t an option listed on Epomaker’s website, but the company says it plans to eventually make this model more widely available. The all-aluminum version also lacks adjustable feet, which you get on versions with a plastic case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/df8swVwT_ITihHI1phFwBrDiU58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788528/jporter_210816_4716_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thankfully this default layout can be customized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehB-9WTyIlTuB3Osrw-MPkP2NOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788527/jporter_210816_4716_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some keycaps can look cluttered with all the different functions they perform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFG51h"&gt;The AK84S has a 75-percent layout, which is similar to what you’ll find on most modern laptops. Unfortunately, it’s US (aka ANSI) only, which means you’re out of luck if you prefer a UK or European ISO layout with a bigger Enter key and smaller left Shift. My model came with bottom row keycaps for both Mac and Windows in the box, so I could swap Option and Command for Windows and Alt keys. There’s no physical switch to change the keyboard’s layout between the two operating systems, but you can do so with a button shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJIFT0"&gt;Before I get into any nitty-gritty details, I just want to emphasize how fantastic the core typing experience of the AK84S is. On my all-aluminum model, keypresses had a lovely crisp feeling to them, and the keyboard as a whole felt wonderfully solid to type on. One rough spot is the keyboard’s stabilizers — the mechanism that stops longer keys from wobbling around. They’re a touch on the rattly side, which detracts from the overall quality of the rest of the board. But as a whole, the keyboard is a joy to type on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="kWoGA9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10709354"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VPSqus"&gt;While I enjoyed the day-to-day typing experience of the AK84S, I had a few issues with the keyboard over time. For starters, I don’t love the look of Epomaker’s stock keycaps. Each key has so many different functions that the keycaps end up looking really cluttered, and given the option, I’d probably swap them out for a third-party set (there aren’t any particularly non-standard keys you need to be aware of on this keyboard, but pay close attention to the bottom row of any keycap set you buy). The printed legends on my PBT keycaps also weren’t especially durable; after a month of use, the legends on the home row keys had started to fade. Given the option I’d probably opt for the ABS keycaps. ABS as a plastic has a reputation for going shiny over time, but the legends on the versions available for the AK84S are double-shot, which means they’re not going to wear away anytime soon. There’s also an unusual silicone keycap option which I wasn’t able to try, and which costs $65. Maybe it’s a fun novelty? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2LcKMi8bmg0ztivf1323dcWpZWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788530/jporter_210816_4716_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice the fading, particularly on the ‘K’ and ‘L’ keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rxv8fl"&gt;As well as swapping keycaps, the AK84S also features hot-swappable switches, which make it easy to swap out the switches that come with your board without having to use a soldering iron. You use the small metal tool that comes in the box to ease each switch out of its socket, before inserting a replacement. It’s a painless process that gives you the easy option of using a vast array of weird and wonderful switches with the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXzOxq"&gt;I generally think that if a 75-percent layout is well thought out, then it’s possible to fit every key most people use on a daily basis. But the AK84S’s Windows layout is a little strange. The default screenshot button is unlabeled (it’s F13, in case you’re wondering), and there’s also a whole key dedicated to Insert, a button I’ve never pressed on purpose. Personally, I would have also preferred Home and End keys over Page Up and Page Down, but the former are accessible via a function button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pX69VA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Layout customization is tricky, but possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XAmRSt"&gt;Thankfully, it’s possible to customize the AK84S’s layout using a piece of companion software, but the lack of documentation makes this an… interesting process. For starters, as of this writing, Epomaker’s website doesn’t actually list the AK84S on its &lt;a href="https://epomaker.com/pages/software-downloads"&gt;downloads page&lt;/a&gt;. But if you choose to download the software available for “SK, GK &amp;amp; NT Keyboards’’ you’ll end up with a program called GK6XPlus, which recognized the AK84S and allowed me to customize its layout (after I asked the company about this, it said it would amend its website). I wouldn’t call it an intuitive piece of software to use, but after a bit of experimenting I ended up with a layout that carried over regardless of which computer I plugged the keyboard into. This software can also customize the keyboard’s RGB backlighting, if you’re into that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oh0y2I"&gt;I used the AK84S wired over USB-C for the majority of my time with it, but it also includes Bluetooth connectivity and a 4,000mAh battery that Epomaker claims should get you 50 hours of use with its RGB lighting turned on, or as much as 880 hours with it turned off. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to validate these claims, but in theory they put it far ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-hot-swappable-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Keychron’s competing K2&lt;/a&gt;, which offers up to 240 hours of use. Like many other wireless keyboards, the AK84S can remember up to three devices it’s been paired with, and you can switch between them easily with keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_A1e4cuhCvqJR7El5H790gXPIMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788525/jporter_210816_4716_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The aluminum case doesn’t have adjustable feet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HOLwvrSYgMjkw2OA6YVvZA0wBcU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788529/jporter_210816_4716_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re called Panda keycaps for a reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykKOSW"&gt;I have a lot of small problems with the Epomaker AK84S. I think its default Windows layout isn’t great, the printing on its PBT keycaps is low quality, and the support and documentation you get with the board leaves a lot to be desired. You’re also dealing with a small company that’s shipping all its products internationally, which means you have to be patient with orders in a way that you don’t with a more mainstream brand like Corsair or Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o5bSIE"&gt;But the core typing experience of the Epomaker AK84S is good enough that I’m willing to forgive basically all of these issues. Yes, its software is clunky, and yes its documentation is bad, but they’re both problems that can be overcome with a little patience and then ignored. Add in other quality-of-life features like Bluetooth support and hot-swappable switches, and you’ve got a board that should last you years. Or at least until you get an itch to buy another keyboard for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays mandatory return to office until January 2022, citing COVID-19 surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SnhLWY1-n2OuGl3h_ZHVZNVISk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751419/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fQ5JS0"&gt;Apple is delaying its mandatory return to offices until at least January 2022, citing a surge in COVID-19 cases. The company will give employees a month’s notice before they have to return to in-person work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhOMfs"&gt;In an internal email sent this evening, Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of people and retail, encouraged employees to get vaccinated and noted that Apple retail stores remain open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNPfap"&gt;“I know there are feeling of frustration that the pandemic is not yet behind us,” she wrote. “For many colleagues around the world, this period has been a time of great tragedy, suffering, and heartbreak. Please know that we are all here to support one another and stand with one another during such challenging times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9ysli"&gt;The company, which previously discouraged working from home for most employees, changed its stance in June when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Tim Cook said he would test a hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that would require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. That date was then moved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;to at least October&lt;/a&gt; — and now the New Year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKC6Xf"&gt;Some employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against this model&lt;/a&gt;, saying they want a more flexible policy where anyone who wants to work from home can. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla is working on humanoid robots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mdRYrzmjfWRFBhTHvsizDCBAHxo=/86x0:1205x746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69751136/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_9.06.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIAE4V"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company is working on a humanoid robot and that it will build a prototype “sometime next year.” The humanoid robot will leverage Tesla’s experience with automated machines in its factories, as well as some of the hardware and software that powers the company’s Autopilot driver assistance software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BN7SgY"&gt;Musk, who has spoken repeatedly about his fears of runaway artificial intelligence, said the Tesla Bot is “intended to be friendly,” but that the company is designing the machine at a “mechanical level” so that “you can run away from it, and most likely overpower it.” It will be five feet, eight inches tall, weigh 125 pounds, and have a screen for a face. The code name for the bot inside the company is “Optimus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lhT6i4Q76JxRWGxMiwKuzGTMwzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22794095/robotics_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9iL4HB"&gt;The robots will be designed to handle “tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/AI"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; reads, but little else, at least at first. (There, the bot is simply called “Tesla Bot.”) “I think essentially in the future, physical work will be a choice, if you want to do it you can,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3Zfb6"&gt;Musk revealed drawings of the robot near the tail end of his company’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"&gt;AI Day&lt;/a&gt;” event, where it showcased some of the artificial intelligence and supercomputer technologies that it’s working on with the goal of one day powering self-driving cars. The company also had a mannequin version on the stage, which wasn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VIJQx"&gt;Tesla’s history is littered with fanciful ideas that never panned out — like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tweetermeyer/status/1182096334888697857"&gt;a solar-powered Supercharger network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/videos/battery-swap-event"&gt;battery swapping&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMM0lRfX6YI"&gt;robotic snake-style chargers&lt;/a&gt; — so it’s anyone’s guess as to whether a working Tesla Bot will ever see the light of day. But the company is where it is today because of Musk’s sheer will. Asked about the near-term economics of entering the robotics industry, though, Musk said “we will have to see.” &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6qjUz"&gt;Video sharing site OnlyFans, best known for its creators’ adult videos and photos, will prohibit sexually explicit content starting October 1st. First &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it is making the changes because of pressure from its banking and payment provider partners, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633411/onlyfans-banned-explicit-porn-sex-content-after-bbc-investigation-leak"&gt;a BBC investigation found&lt;/a&gt; that the company had been lenient on creators who had posted illegal content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcpuBo"&gt;“In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,” OnlyFans said in a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G7ho3"&gt;Creators on the platform will still be allowed to post nude images as long as they comply with the site’s &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt;. More information will be available in the coming days, the company added: “OnlyFans remains committed to the highest levels of safety and content moderation of any social platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uXlUB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnlyFans pushes SFW app on iOS and Android as it tries to shake adult image","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"},{"title":"OnlyFans’ inexplicable ban on porn might be explained by this BBC investigation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633411/onlyfans-banned-explicit-porn-sex-content-after-bbc-investigation-leak"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XBwYYp"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865"&gt;according to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, the site’s moderation hasn’t been up to that standard. It reports that a “compliance manual” instructed employees to give users three strikes, even if the content that was being removed was illegal. The &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; also reports that more successful accounts, which had a larger subscriber base, were handled by a separate team and given additional warnings when they broke the site’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIZYVI"&gt;OnlyFans claims more than 2 million creators — who it says have earned more than $5 billion on its platform — and 130 million users. Last year, the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"&gt;generated $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in sales (of which OnlyFans receives a 20 percent cut). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FUT9G"&gt;The company is seeking investors at a valuation of more than $1 billion but has had difficulty attracting investors, &lt;a href="http://axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html"&gt;according to a report from&lt;em&gt; Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because of the proliferation of porn on the site (&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; notes the company didn’t mention pornography at all in its pitch deck to investors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2RoA0r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite the safer environment it provides sex workers, online porn is a hard sell for investors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7A5uq7"&gt;Despite its ability to draw eyeballs, and the safer environment it provides sex workers, online porn is a hard sell for investors. Recall that as Verizon prepared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20804894/tumblr-acquisition-matt-mullenweg-ceo-automattic-wordpress-verizon-changes-vergecast"&gt;sell Tumblr to Automattic&lt;/a&gt;, the blogging site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;permanently banned adult content&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, a highly controversial move at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBrU92"&gt;Along with the announcement about sexually explicit content, OnlyFans published its first &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/transparency/july2021"&gt;monthly transparency report for July&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, “as part of our commitment to safety and transparency.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjjJbX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 9:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about the BBC’s investigation into OnlyFan’s moderation practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans’ inexplicable ban on porn might be explained by this BBC investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnlyFans Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Re2FKkGtcXQhnLCLbjcAzeOLFtw=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750958/1232558630.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UkT6uk"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;OnlyFans stunned the world&lt;/a&gt; by revealing it would ditch the thing it’s famous for: sexually explicit videos and photography. Yes, OnlyFans is banning porn, starting October 1st. But at least one publication wasn’t completely shocked by the decision — because it came in the middle of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865"&gt;a BBC investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how the video sharing site was &lt;em&gt;knowingly &lt;/em&gt;letting creators slide despite publishing illegal content on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02U8yR"&gt;Instead of banning an account or sounding the alarm, the company explicitly recommends in a “compliance manual” that moderators should first issue a series of three warnings about why each piece of content has been removed. Unless it’s a successful creator, of course, in which case “accounts with higher numbers of subscribers can be given additional warnings when rules are broken,” the BBC writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOOXU0"&gt;Oh, and the site’s most successful creators? Those are handled by a different team, according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vx59DX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More important users were apparently tolerated longer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DytMjh"&gt;While OnlyFans told the BBC that the leaked “compliance manuals” it obtained are not “official guidance,” the news organization is quick to point out that one of them has the company’s chief operating officer listed as making edits to the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpgrh2"&gt;The BBC’s investigation doesn’t end there: it also scoured the site for illegal content, watched videos about exploiting homeless people, spoke to some of OnlyFans’ moderators itself, quoted a US Homeland Security agent about how many child abuse images originate there, and tested to see if OnlyFans would notice if it set up accounts advertising themselves as young teenagers with photos for sale. (OnlyFans didn’t, until the BBC pointed it out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtTjFi"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865"&gt;read the full story here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s damning, and so it wouldn’t wholly be surprising if OnlyFans’ sudden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"&gt;pivot to safe-for-work imagery&lt;/a&gt; might have something to do with the intense amount of scrutiny the company saw imminently headed its way. It’s also worth noting the company &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/transparency/july2021"&gt;just today rushed out its first transparency report&lt;/a&gt;, which — while claiming “we invest heavily in fighting child sexual exploitation online” — pairs that claim with incredibly few details, and only for the month of July 2021. In July, it contributed a single CSAM hash to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s database, and deactivated a grand total of 15 accounts for alleged CSAM activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg7Lxb"&gt;Onlyfans didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVaB4i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulOIGG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much it costs to fix a Z Fold 3 or Z Flip 3 with a broken screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTDk2waIZmsFLjnEJEzqlkj8r94=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750869/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3KW8h2"&gt;Samsung’s new foldables are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;quite impressive&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;making them as durable as possible&lt;/a&gt; — but sometimes, accidents happen. We asked Samsung how much it would cost to replace a Z Flip or Z Fold 3’s screen should something happen to it, and here’s what the company told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8jmP"&gt;Samsung provides a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/?model=N0053854" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year warranty&lt;/a&gt; with the phones, so if your screen breaks in a way that’s covered, you shouldn’t have to pay for a repair. Out of warranty, fixing the interior folding screen of a Z Fold 3 costs $479. Doing the same for a Z Flip 3 costs $369. Thankfully, the external displays are much less expensive — fixing a broken outer screen will set you back $149 for the Fold and $99 for the Flip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MngxoL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Out of warranty, the Fold’s folding screen costs $479 to replace, and the Flip’s costs $369&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wh3XmT"&gt;Samsung also offers its Samsung Care Plus subscription, which costs $12.99 a month for either phone (though Samsung is currently running a preorder deal where you don’t have to make Care Plus payments for 12 months). For Care Plus subscribers, Samsung says there’s a $249 charge for an out-of-warranty screen repair — though the company says that the “deductible covers up to three screen repairs per year.” Care Plus also extends your warranty for two more years after the original expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2U2HC"&gt;For traditional, non-folding phones, there’s often the option to repair the screen yourself, which can end up costing less than having the manufacturer do it. However, for Samsung’s new foldables, this isn’t likely to be easy. Samsung’s aforementioned push for durability means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;the phones are filled with a lot of sticky, hard to remove stuff&lt;/a&gt; like tape, glue, and goo. The company says the folding screens are made out of multiple layers, which are sealed with a “pressure-sensitive adhesive.” As someone who’s taken apart their share of devices, that sounds like an absolute nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qyTv7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The repair prices for the new foldables are less than the ones for the older versions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5Dhxz"&gt;That said, this isn’t much of a change. It’s not like Samsung’s previous foldables were particularly easy to repair. And while the company’s prices are higher than those for more traditional phone repairs — a broken iPhone 12 screen &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;costs $279 to replace&lt;/a&gt;; a Galaxy S21 5G’s costs $199 — Samsung is actually charging less than it used to. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the Z Fold 2’s inner screen costs $549 to replace out of warranty and the Z Flip 5G’s costs $499, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881040/samsung-galaxy-fold-screen-replacemet-premier-service-cost-unboxing"&gt;depending on when you bought the phone&lt;/a&gt;, you may be eligible for a one-time replacement &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/repair/pricing/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for significantly less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r7SH13"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Samsung beefed up its new folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Adobe is acquiring collaborative video software maker Frame.io for $1.275 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCi2X_fsERfUjLnEXvdGJN09N-g=/57x0:1136x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750828/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_4.01.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Frame.io&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkTUp7"&gt;Adobe &lt;a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-to-Acquire-Frame.io/default.aspx"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s acquiring the company behind popular &lt;a href="http://frame.io"&gt;collaborative video production software of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, Frame.io, for $1.275 billion. Adobe says it tried to create its own collaboration software on its own, but settled on buying Frame.io because some customers were already using it in their workflows, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/adobe-to-buy-frame-io-for-1-3-billion-in-cash-in-video-push?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgA7wp"&gt;Frame.io takes the frequently time consuming process of reviewing edits and footage, and makes it asynchronous and on the web, Google Workspace-style. Editors, clients, and whoever else can use the company’s cloud-based software to store and view footage, and leave feedback on edits, just by sharing a link. Frame.io also offers integrations with popular video editing software like Adobe’s Premiere Pro, Apple’s Final Cut Pro, and Avid Media Composer. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is no stranger to Frame.io — our video team has been using the software for the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2rKU3k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI7AcNfHXeQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yleuqz"&gt;Frame.io will operate independently until Adobe’s deal closes, after which the company’s founders, Frame.io CEO Emery Wells and co-founder John Traver, will join Adobe. Wells will continue to lead the Frame.io team and report directly to Adobe’s chief product office Scott Belsky, Adobe says. &lt;a href="https://blog.frame.io/2021/08/19/adobe-announces-intent-to-acquire-frameio/"&gt;In a statement on the acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, Wells adds “the Frame.io product you know and love is not going anywhere,” and says Adobe’s ownership will offer more resources, and closer integrations with Premiere Pro and Creative Cloud. Frame.io will also continue supporting non-Adobe software like Final Cut Pro, Avid, and DaVinci Resolve, according to Wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jAYWzY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adobe’s Creative Cloud might be getting bigger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCdwOV"&gt;Not outlined in either announcement is what subscribing to Frame.io will look like in the future once the deal closes. Currently you can &lt;a href="https://www.frame.io/pricing"&gt;use a limited version of Frame.io for free&lt;/a&gt;, or pay $15 per month, $25 per month, or custom enterprise pricing for varying amounts of cloud storage and users. It’s not hard to imagine those plans getting seamlessly integrated into a Creative Cloud subscription at some point in the future. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Adobe if it plans to include Frame.io in its existing subscriptions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8ORG9"&gt;Adobe’s made moves to add its own collaboration features into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21075970/adobe-premiere-pro-productions-google-doc-drive-collaborative-editing"&gt;Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274936/adobe-invite-edit-collaborate-photoshop-illustrator-fresco"&gt;Photoshop, and Illustrator&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but nothing that seems quite the same as Frame.io. Buying the company could naturally sweeten the deal for anyone who’s already a Creative Cloud subscriber, while strengthening Adobe’s tight hold on the creative industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spawn Together campaign surpasses $1 million fundraising goal for AbleGamers charity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Steven Spohn wearing a suit, sitting in his wheelchair in front of a backdrop with “The Game Awards” on it. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nfbmnWT3OKRc2lgOvifV9mQDc8=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750562/888461160.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Du9pe"&gt;Steven Spohn passed a goal this week that he’s been chasing for nearly a year. He raised over a million dollars for &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org"&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/a&gt;, a charity that seeks to improve accessibility in games and connects disabled people with peer support and adaptive tech for gaming. Spohn has been its COO for 15 years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MyYKf"&gt;The charity’s mission, he says, is about giving people with disabilities access to “that sense of independence and that feeling of exploration or excitement or relaxation, whatever it is you’re going for, to help you mentally get through the tough times.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVNYH9"&gt;Spohn has multiple progressive illnesses that impact his functioning. He started the fundraising campaign, Spawn Together, in September of last year to celebrate his 40th birthday. He says he hoped that more funds for AbleGamers would enable it to continue its work as he eventually loses more mobility or the ability to talk or type. “I just want to make sure that when I’m not able to do that stuff, that everything’s gonna keep going as well as it can,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="19yTY9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is my 40th birthday!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For my 39th birthday, I made friends with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheRock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To celebrate this milestone, I'm going to raise $1,000,000 for charity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I'm going to need your help. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bu1t9KKRg1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bu1t9KKRg1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steven Spohn (Spawn) (@stevenspohn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenspohn/status/1305905174632857607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JCfkQi"&gt;Though Spohn’s goal was a million dollars, he didn’t think he’d actually reach it. “I thought, ‘hey, you know, I’ll raise a couple thousand, maybe $100,000. It’ll be great, we’ll spend some money on hiring a new peer counselor and then we’ll be good,’” he says. “Well, that just kept leading into more and more opportunities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwrzgM"&gt;In November, streamer Ben “DrLupo” Lupo announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546694/twitch-virtual-twitchcon-glitchcon-date"&gt;GlitchCon&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/twitch-to-donate-1-million-to-ablegamers-to-help-gamers-with-disabilities"&gt;Twitch was donating $1 million&lt;/a&gt; to AbleGamers. Spohn was ecstatic, but he decided not to count Twitch’s donation toward his personal goal. He wanted to continue gathering smaller amounts at a time through his campaign, rather than only relying on big companies. “I can’t depend on one large corporation to decide to hand over a million bucks every single year,” he says, “there had to be a way to do it where we didn’t have to depend on one CEO saying, ‘you know what, give it to them.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqVfCv"&gt;Hundreds of streamers helped raise money over the course of the campaign, with Twitch matching donations up to certain amounts. Last week, Kayla “lilsimsie” Sims raised nearly $60,000 during a birthday stream, and Twitch matched $35,000. A few days later, Spohn checked the Spawn Together page and realized the total &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenspohn/status/1427324879486046215"&gt;had surpassed the goal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ugy6Tq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WE RAISED $95,000 FOR ABLEGAMERS TODAY&lt;/p&gt;— Kayla (@lilsimsie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lilsimsie/status/1426367677791100937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dAx9xM"&gt;“I think the most important thing about Spawn Together,” says Spohn, “was trying to prove a point that if people banded together, they could do a good thing, and really move the needle for a cause together by doing tiny good things all at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb7glV"&gt;Spohn says there’s still plenty of work to do. “I’ve definitely grown up over the year and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;realized that although million dollars is big, it doesn’t leave the organization to run for 20 years on its own.” He says the money will help AbleGamers hire more peer counselors, occupational therapists, and other experts to keep expanding its work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T TV will officially become DirecTV Stream next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OinA03PZVPpaBuocoQNiLrsiIA0=/154x0:1690x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750375/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_1.40.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x5jZBY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV and its defunct AT&amp;amp;T TV Now sibling will officially become DirecTV Stream, a new unified service spun out of a deal between TPG Capital and AT&amp;amp;T for the telecommunication giant’s streaming properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d221R0"&gt;DirecTV began updating AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers of the change on August 14th. On the welcome screens of both services’ mobile apps informing them that the change would officially take place on August 26th, a spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. DirectTV Stream rebrands AT&amp;amp;T’s services acquired in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608577/att-directv-tpg-deal-u-verse-att-tv-new-company"&gt;TPG Capital deal&lt;/a&gt;, which did not include HBO Max. (WarnerMedia, home to HBO Max, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;merge with Discovery&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0NtNZ5iNptz861sh1Y1R-ioM2FM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793519/IMG_1845.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DirecTV&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFsLd"&gt;According to a company &lt;a href="https://www.directv.com/stream/"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;, “AT&amp;amp;T satellite, streaming or IP video customers will automatically keep their video service, any bundled wireless, internet or HBO Max services, and associated discounts with no action needed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPf9GG"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21160860/att-tv-now-available-android-tv-google-assistant-streaming"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; as the company’s premium TV streaming experience. AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, the company’s skinny streaming bundle, technically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226881/att-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo"&gt;became AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and new customers could no longer sign up for Now. (The company &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/at-t-tv-now-is-merging-with-at-t-tv-wait-what-1846043744"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that AT&amp;amp;T TV Now customers would still be able to access their accounts, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20dzAE"&gt;If all of this sounds needlessly confusing, it is. With any luck, this will be the last significant branding change that AT&amp;amp;T’s existing or future streaming customers see for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
