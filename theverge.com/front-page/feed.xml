    <title>Here’s the truth about the crypto miner that comes with Norton Antivirus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPCgfszOWnQ8TP8wG-uwRjgmDH8=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359839/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton Crypto promises to turn your computer’s idle time into cash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5Tvrk"&gt;Norton is facing criticism for including a crypto miner alongside its Norton 360 security software. Activists like Cory Doctorow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1478479483585933312"&gt;have claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the company “sneakily installs cryptomining software on your computer” and skims a commission on profits, and outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/hard-to-delete-cryptocurrency-miner-irks-norton-360-users"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/norton-360-now-comes-with-a-cryptominer/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krebs on Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/no-easy-way-to-uninstall-norton-crypto/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have also written about users expressing frustration trying to uninstall it. While there’s more than a grain of truth to these claims, we dug into it ourselves and found they’re being blown out of proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWpLRM"&gt;Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/6/2/22465862/norton-360-crypto-mining-ethereum-coinbase"&gt;Norton very publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; it was adding a crypto miner to its Norton 360 security suite, pitching it as a safer alternative to trying to install complex, “unvetted” mining programs from the internet. It was initially only available to a limited number of users, but now seems to be available to anyone who installs the program — but in the six or so months since the announcement, there hasn’t been much discussion about the software until this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P7aOXE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is fucking wild. Norton "Antivirus" now sneakily installs cryptomining software on your computer, and then SKIMS A COMMISSION. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6s2otyCd78"&gt;https://t.co/6s2otyCd78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cory Doctorow (@doctorow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1478479483585933312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O5L9Z0"&gt;Now, it’s suddenly the center of a backlash, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mAxius/status/1476968324672204801"&gt;some Twitter users&lt;/a&gt; accusing Norton of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCalafin/status/1478214882281484288"&gt;installing a crypto miner on users’ computers&lt;/a&gt; without any warning. In a very technical sense, that’s true — my colleague Sean Hollister installed a copy of Norton 360 for himself and did indeed find that the mining app NCrypt.exe was included in the program’s directory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y19oj6"&gt;However, that doesn’t mean that Norton will automatically start mining on your computer, as some seem to believe. &lt;a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/aa/home/current/solutions/v138473899"&gt;Norton’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt; says that it won’t mine without permission and that “in addition to having a device that meets system requirements, you must also turn on Norton Crypto on your device.” Sean says that as far as he could tell, this appeared to be true; the feature didn’t surreptitiously activate after he installed Norton. It didn’t open until he asked it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3z4iT"&gt;The TL;DR is that yes, Norton does install a crypto miner with its software, without making that clear in the initial setup process. But it isn’t going to do anything unless you specifically opt in, so it’s not a situation where you’ll install the security suite and instantly start seeing your computer lag as it crunches crypto in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pUL3JA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can delete NCrypt.exe if you turn off the tamper protection feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhOKY1"&gt;A NortonLifeLock spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that you can completely remove NCrypt.exe by &lt;a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/norton-360/current/solutions/v44151491"&gt;temporarily turning off Norton’s tamper protection feature&lt;/a&gt;, and then deleting the executable. We confirmed that ourselves, and it could be good news for anyone worried about Norton remotely activating the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1y7fr"&gt;We asked Norton if it would make a pledge that the feature would always be opt-in, and spokesperson Spring Harris told us that “[the] feature requires special device hardware and user consent to function. We are transparent about how our software performs on user devices and we have no intention of changing this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0amq8"&gt;None of this is to defend Norton’s inclusion of a crypto miner in its security suite — it’s simply to explain what is and isn’t happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDVIt9"&gt;As mentioned before, we installed Norton ourselves to get first-hand experience with the miner. While the service may be opt-in, Norton isn’t making it hard to find — when Sean installed the software, its control panel had a big green banner at the top with the text “Turn your PC’s idle time into cash.” Clicking the “show me how” button shows you a slideshow about the feature, a large “Agree and get started” button, and some smaller text letting you know that the feature you’re turning on is Norton Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton Crypto isn’t a hard feature to find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mkxq4e_Zeh0T3c2NgI_xZ8J3waY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150457/NortonSecurity_nGJT60fR6n.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton promises that it’ll only mine when you’re not otherwise using your computer (and you can manually pause it if need be).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VU9nwC"&gt;After you turn on Norton Crypto, it’ll set up a wallet for you, and immediately start using your computer’s GPU to mine Ethereum (its &lt;a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/aa/home/current/solutions/v133891548"&gt;system requirements&lt;/a&gt; say you need an Nvidia or AMD card with at least 6GB of memory). Any earnings will be periodically deposited in the wallet set up for you, and &lt;a href="https://community.norton.com/en/forums/my-crypto-wallet-doesnt-allow-me-withdraw"&gt;once you reach a minimum threshold&lt;/a&gt; you’ll be able to withdraw your earnings to Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9skDm"&gt;Norton has incentive to get people using the feature. As &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/hands-on-with-norton-antivirus-ethereum-mining-the-good-and-the-bad/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt; pointed out when it tried the software last year&lt;/a&gt;, Norton takes a whopping 15 percent of any earnings you make from mining. Without diving too deep into how mining works, Norton Crypto’s &lt;a href="https://www.nortonlifelock.com/content/dam/nortonlifelock/pdfs/eulas/licensing-agreement/NC-EAP-terms-en.pdf"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) say it’s running a mining pool, which combines everybody’s computing power to increase the chances of mining a block — when that happens, everybody who contributed power gets a share of the reward. It’s that reward from which Norton is taking its cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVDpxV"&gt;Pool operators do often take a cut or fee for bringing everyone together. However, the fees are usually closer to 1 or 2 percent, which is obviously significantly lower. And, of course, there’s the elephant in the room: anyone using Norton’s software to mine has already paid the company a subscription fee for its security software (and after we purchased a copy, we &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;had to provide our payment information so that it could automatically renew itself every year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C8vw1h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our tests pretty much exactly broke even when factoring in electricity costs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NvlSP4"&gt;Is the reward from mining good enough that you can ignore the high fees, or consider them a convenience cost for not having to figure out how to join a pool on your own (which is usually a reasonably technical process)? We tried it out for ourselves, measuring electricity consumption using a Kill-A-Watt power meter. The results? With the current difficulty of mining a block and Ethereum prices, we completely broke even for what we earned versus what we paid for power. In real numbers, a night of mining on an RTX 3060 Ti netted $0.66 cents worth of Ethereum and cost $0.66 in off-peak electricity. Norton took all the profit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU6KilRNACTaBQkBbaOCyaEeWgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151249/image__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norton tells you how much you’ve earned and gives you projected earnings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gkqDMe"&gt;Given &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s policy against holding cryptocurrency, we’ll be immediately divesting the fraction of an ETH we earned in our test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k93205"&gt;Even if you had stronger mining hardware and cheaper electricity, Norton’s model could end up being a rough deal. It deposits your cut of Ethereum into your Norton Crypto wallet, but if you want to use it or exchange it for fiat currency you’ll have to cash it out — currently, the only option for that is by transferring it to a Coinbase account. However, doing so will incur a transaction fee (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800995/constitutiondao-refund-progress-steep-gas-fees-cryptocurrency"&gt;also known as a gas fee&lt;/a&gt;) that’s charged by the Ethereum network itself. That could mean that you’d have to mine a lot of crypto before it’d make financial sense to withdraw it from your Norton wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqB0NJ"&gt;The deal looks a lot better from Norton’s end, though — as is often the case with crypto, scale is key here. While using the feature may not be particularly profitable for any one individual, if a lot of people try it out, Norton’s cut could add up to a significant sum. Whether it’ll be enough to make up for the PR hit the company’s taken from this feature is hard to say — but even ignoring Twitter, the users on &lt;a href="https://community.norton.com/en/forums/norton-crypto"&gt;Norton’s own Crypto forum&lt;/a&gt; don’t seem to be particularly happy with how it’s been going.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department cracks down on Amazon sellers’ DVD price-fixing scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AethyZZGLWMyzWFi9vl4xJ5LPE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359783/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hz30yV"&gt;The Justice Department has charged three men with a DVD and Blu-ray price-fixing operation run through the Amazon Marketplace. The men — Morris Sutton, Emmanuel Hourizadeh, and Raymond Nouvahian — &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-amazon-marketplace-sellers-plead-guilty-price-fixing-dvds-and-blu-ray-discs-ongoing"&gt;pleaded guilty yesterday&lt;/a&gt; to violating criminal antitrust laws under the Sherman Act for a scheme that lasted from 2017 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MUvdF"&gt;Sutton, Hourizadeh, and Nouvahian collaborated with each other (as well as other unnamed parties, at least one of which has also pleaded guilty) across several US states to make buyers pay more for movie discs from Amazon’s third-party Marketplace storefronts. A &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tned.102099/gov.uscourts.tned.102099.4.0.pdf"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tned.102053/gov.uscourts.tned.102053.4.0.pdf"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tned.102100/gov.uscourts.tned.102100.6.0.pdf"&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; agreements offer a few more details about the plot, which resulted in Sutton selling at least $360,000 worth of DVDs and Blu-rays over the course of two years while Hourizadeh and Nouvahian took in at least $1.1 million. The conspirators communicated with each other to eliminate competition and raise prices, a legal violation that carries up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joDqWG"&gt;In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter called the plea deals part of a larger commitment to protecting competition in online sales. “As American consumers increasingly turn to e-commerce, it is critically important to deter, detect and prosecute crimes that prevent fair and open competition in online marketplaces,” said Kanter. “These charges demonstrate the Antitrust Division’s continued commitment to prosecuting anticompetitive conduct wherever it may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9murR"&gt;Kanter is known as a prominent critic of potentially monopolistic online platforms. Before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;being confirmed&lt;/a&gt; as the antitrust division head in President Joe Biden’s Justice Department, he represented Yelp and Microsoft in cases alleging anti-competitive behavior by Google, and alongside Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, he’s presided over government antitrust investigations of several “Big Tech” companies. The Amazon price-fixing charges illustrate another avenue for the department to crack down on pieces of these platforms, even when the companies behind them aren’t directly implicated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: CES 2022 favorites, vaporware, and what may actually ship </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhQnBShO9e1Df4Rzg5pLlHRJMVM=/144x0:759x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359512/BMW_E_Ink.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cCaoMM"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdtL0C"&gt;Today, we published the first &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; of 2022 — and we’re starting off strong with a 90-minute show on nearly everything we saw from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;Consumer Electronics Show this week&lt;/a&gt;. In what turned out to be a pretty decent CES (without even being there in person), Nilay, Dieter, and Alex Cranz run through all the gadgets, TVs, cars, and computers that point toward the future of consumer technology and some perhaps that were just an art installation or vaporware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RSzc7w"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP6433499017&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n8ai3g"&gt;There’s a whole lot discussed on this week’s show, so listen here or in your preferred podcast player to catch up on what you may have missed this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Swiss Army drops WhatsApp for homegrown messaging service, citing privacy concerns </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of the Swiss flag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhuKDk_XlnceKx98nH6_O-GYLn0=/0x151:2048x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359418/2346228148_28b0bacd6b_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://flickr.com/photos/jamescridland/2346228148/in/photolist-4zk2Ts-YFyXYj-5PyiGh-4UTMTp-ee5Kqj-wctj-bdfPTD-6H1nC5-XTC62M-9EnAV4-9dX9aG-df4Sv9-df4Sis-df4S86-8LMXY2-Grqrf-ACBYKP-2inhX8t-fjJqdd-C16UYo-B2wjBx-kfGuN-B2uciD-2jQA65h-2k7Si9A-C16tKY-4JZNiE-qHFJaq-4jEwh2-2mFKTu9-2iYUPmR-2jtQWSC-5KdrW9-WHvEVu-ceZfKj-ePcd4N-5jGKWU-5Aca3X-aDc1Wz-4JxkGu-2hG8fKh-2m6xrJg-2k4hXpi-4tMNHV-t8tab-gzdxv-gzd9j-nZh5XT-76kMDS-p3Q7gk" target="_blank"&gt;James Cridland / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xurKRk"&gt;The Swiss army has banned the use of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and other foreign encrypted messaging services by army personnel, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-army-instant-messaging-d3c7c8fd54a78e8cc17fe930014d92d2"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and instructed staff to use the Swiss-made Threema app instead. The announcement was made in a letter sent to top army staff in December, citing privacy concerns based on US authorities’ ability to access data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX3EB0"&gt;The original letter reportedly told army chiefs that “no other messaging service will be authorized,” although a spokesperson subsequently seemed to tone down the strength of the decree, describing it to the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; as a “recommendation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YfzNH"&gt;The primary concern seems to be the ability of authorities in Washington to access data stored by companies that fall under US jurisdiction, as &lt;a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/questions-to-ask-for-compliance-with-the-eu-gdpr-and-the-u-s-cloud-act/"&gt;described in the US CLOUD Act&lt;/a&gt;. The CLOUD Act obliges service providers under US jurisdiction to comply with search warrants, regardless of where servers are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAhkBE"&gt;As a Swiss company with no servers hosted in the US, Threema would not be obliged to respond to such search warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyRTPT"&gt;Given the strong privacy protections mandated by European GDPR regulations, privacy advocates and multinational corporations alike had hoped that records stored in the EU would be outside the purview of the US court system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKzHh8"&gt;However, in January 2020, a New York federal judge ruled that &lt;a href="https://www.crowelldatalaw.com/2020/01/burden-of-compliance-with-foreign-data-privacy-laws-does-not-justify-withholding-of-banking-records/"&gt;compliance with foreign privacy laws did not negate an obligation to produce documents in discovery&lt;/a&gt;, in a case related to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram"&gt;SEC’s pursuit of the Telegram messaging app&lt;/a&gt; for not adequately registering its cryptocurrency token sale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is adding audio running workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing three Apple Watches showing screens of the first three Time to Run workouts." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQKgZ4tiPeuNw-R8ZustJzR4JJk=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359412/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_TTR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Run launches January 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1pmVP"&gt;After launching Fitness Plus in December 2020, Apple has continuously added new features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;audio walks with celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and new workout programs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"&gt;for pregnant and older users&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it’s announcing a few more additions, with the standout being audio running experiences dubbed Time to Run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tfTox"&gt;According to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Time to Run can help users “become more consistent and better runners,” and each session focuses on a popular running route in a specific location. The sessions will be led by Fitness Plus trainers Emily Fayette, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Sam Sanchez, and Scott Carvin — they all also coach the service’s treadmill workouts. Apple will also be adding another running coach, Cory Wharton-Malcolm. Each episode will also feature playlists to match the intensity of the run and chosen location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNG6SR"&gt;Time to Run is set to debut on January 10th, with new episodes arriving every Monday. The series will launch with three episodes and locales: London, Brooklyn, and Miami Beach. Users will also be shown photos on the Apple Watch of “notable sights” along the route in each city. Apple says the episodes can be played both on outdoor and indoor runs. It’ll also be available for wheelchair users as Time to Run or Push. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPjpUE"&gt;From the description, it sounds very similar to Time to Walk, which are roughly 25–40 minutes walks narrated by a celebrity guest and their curated mini-playlist. Audio or coached runs aren’t unique to Fitness Plus — you’ll also find them in other workout apps, including Aaptiv, Runtastic, Runkeeper, and Peloton. We’ll have to check out a workout for ourselves to see how Time to Run stacks up, though if it’s anything like Time to Walk, it’ll be more about an inclusive experience than hardcore intervals or sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An iPad showing the new Collections feature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2AO77Hqu1b3jAXDHsqyY7mvius=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152330/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_collections.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collections are curated workout bundles toward a specific goal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIeq2v"&gt;The service is also adding curated workouts and meditations called Collections. The idea is to pick out a few selections from Fitness Plus’s library of 2,000 studio workouts and guided meditation that focus on a specific plan over a period of several days or weeks. There will be six Collections at launch: 30-Day Core Challenge, Improve Your Posture with Pilates, Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses, Run Your First 5K, Wind Down for a Better Bedtime, and Strengthen Your Back, Stretch Your Hips. This is a neat addition, as one of the more annoying things about Fitness Plus since its launch has been limited filtering options. While you can search workouts by trainer, music genre, and time, you have to read each workout description to learn more about what each session is tailored toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="501RBN"&gt;Time to Run and Collections aren’t the only new updates, however. Time to Walk is also getting a third season, with guests like Rebel Wilson, Bernice A. King, Hasan Minhaj, Chris Meloni, Ayo Tometi, Chelsea Handler, and Sugar Ray Leonard. Apple’s Artist Spotlight series, which features entire workouts set to a single musician, will add Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira, and The Beatles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H627DY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to preorder the colorful new PS5 covers and DualSense controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/as5Q5hLxV1kitpTRhdhDRdNDYio=/0x0:1065x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359394/ps5_galaxycollection_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The five matching case and controller colors of the PlayStation 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D2cXWf"&gt;Ever since the PlayStation 5 was announced, opinions regarding its design and styling have been, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/11/21288541/playstation-5-ps5-sony-design-memes-roast-twitter-router-face-building"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt;. Many jokes and memes have been made about the gargantuan size of the PS5, and how its two-tone monochromatic color and stretched-out wings are reminiscent of an oversized router. Jokes aside, once Sony revealed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505598/sony-ps5-playstation-5-tear-down-hardware"&gt;white covers are user-removable&lt;/a&gt;, there has been a demand for replacements. Enough people instantly wanted to own a blacked-out PS5 that a small cottage industry of third-party suppliers cropped up, selling unlicensed accessories until Sony came out swinging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;cease and desist letters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vnEDZ2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PS5 Darkplates made me want to grab Sony’s upcoming black faceplates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832727/ps5-playstation-5-darkplates-2-0-dbrand-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OVMbnC"&gt;Sony finally came around and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831965/sony-ps5-covers-faceplates-colors-new-controllers"&gt;announced its own official replacement covers&lt;/a&gt; for the disc-based PS5 and the Digital Edition in December, dubbed the Galaxy Collection, and they’re arriving alongside matching DualSense controllers. The forthcoming faceplates come in black and red — matching the DualSense controllers Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;released over the summer&lt;/a&gt; — as well as entirely new hues called “starlight blue,” “nova pink,” and “galactic purple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7l7rZ"&gt;The lineup of colorful DualSense controllers and console covers has a staggered launch window, with some debuting in January and others being withheld as exclusives through PlayStation Direct until February; others are simply “coming soon.” Regardless of exclusivity and release timetable, expect to pay $54.99 for the replacement covers and $74.99 for the new DualSense colors upon their debut. Here, we review all the options on offer, including where you can preorder them and when to expect them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCSlWS"&gt;We’ll update this post as new information on unannounced release dates is made available, as well as more retailers to buy from. And don’t forget to study the &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/replace-ps5-console-cover/"&gt;instructions for changing your PS5’s outer shell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENVVA6vjVtnhtwSJzwoXFgnOVAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150854/ps5_galaxycollection__dualsense.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uMLEzA"&gt;Where to buy the midnight black cover and DualSense controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lkc0BA"&gt;Quite possibly the most sought-after color for the PS5 is black (don’t you dare call us boring!). Sony already released a DualSense controller and Pulse 3D Wireless Headset with a black finish, and these console covers are the last thing needed to achieve a blackout PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvvstz"&gt;The black DualSense controller is readily available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Midnight-5/dp/B094WL86N5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdRL1ghY4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D83374958%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Midnight-Black%2F596005887&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-midnight-black%2F294963.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for about $70. The upcoming console cover in matching black can be preordered from PlayStation Direct for the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-console-covers-midnight-black.1000029754" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard PS5&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-digital-edition-covers-midnight-black.1000029752" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with each costing $54.99. They are being exclusively released via PlayStation Direct on January 21st, with availability at other retailers expected just under a month later on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="X1JneG"&gt;The red DualSense controller came out alongside its black counterpart and features monotone red face buttons and a two-tone, red-and-black design. It’s readily available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Cosmic-5/dp/B094WN6SY2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdR5DvgeF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D83374957%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Cosmic-Red%2F487490728&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-cosmic-red%2F294961.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for around $75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGE0p9"&gt;The red console cover will allow you to take that red-and-black look to the system itself — like some sort of beautifully evil obelisk. It’s up for preorder now at PlayStation Direct for $54.99, sized for the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-console-covers-cosmic-red.1000029750" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-equipped PS5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/ps5-digital-edition-covers-cosmic-red.1000029748" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the black variant, they also launch on January 21st and are exclusive to Sony’s online store until February 18th, when they will become available at other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="5Wxt4E"&gt;Where to buy the starlight blue, nova pink, and galactic purple covers and DualSense controllers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="56ZSW2"&gt;Here’s where things start to get a little more complicated. The blue, purple, and pink covers are not yet available for preorder. Sony still only lists each as “coming soon,” with no official release date given. Retailers do not have listings for them either, but the corresponding controllers are up for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqV4Nz"&gt;If bright blue is for you, you can get it first in controller form beginning on January 14th when the blue DualSense begins to ship. You can currently preorder it at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-Blue/dp/B09NLJGTHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdQiVbvhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D85561293%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-Blue%2F844540146&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-starlight-blue%2F328284.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for $74.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hrzALF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965122"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5iSkHR"&gt;The pink DualSense, quite possibly the brightest of all these galaxy-themed colors, will also be available for $74.99. It’s launching everywhere simultaneously with the blue model on January 14th, and you can preorder it ahead of time at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Nova-Pink/dp/B09NJNR716?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmdRpKnoFX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-83377785%3Fpreselect%3D85561292%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDualSense-Wireless-Controller-Nova-Pink%2F331182846&amp;amp;subid1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowtopreorderps5coverscontrollers&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualsense-wireless-controller-nova-pink%2F328285.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WrPmHK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oXQvu6"&gt;Lastly, the Galactic Purple DualSense controller is only available for preorder from &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualsense-wireless-controller-galactic-purple.3006396" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Direct&lt;/a&gt; — for that same $74.99. This is the only controller that Sony is keeping exclusive to its own online storefront, though it launches the same day as the others on January 14th. You will have to wait until February 11th for it to be sold elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="67SEF1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965134"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The 2021 iPad Mini with 5G support is $20 off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_PbK6QfFen4CTiTRd0NUmXJzL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359178/vpavic_210924_4766_0022_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad mini 6 (LTE) is selling for $629.98 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIKQDn"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal to drop on Apple’s latest iPad Mini, today is your lucky day. Discounts on the LTE- and 5G-ready version of the iPad Mini are rare, but Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G99C83X?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 64GB model (usually $649.99) for $629.98&lt;/a&gt;. That is a small discount, but for context, it’s actually $1 shy of its best price we’ve seen yet for this model. The tablet, which released in 2021, is equipped with Apple’s A15 Bionic processor, a 12MP rear camera, and USB-C support. It also comes with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in during video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BUjtJj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964801"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="cZqZCV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22677944/apple-ipad-mini-2019-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade-worthwhile"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xkoJUi"&gt;We’ve got another Apple deal for you, but this one may help you achieve your fitness goals, if you have some. While we’ve been seeing a lot of deals on the 41mm and 45mm GPS versions, we haven’t seen as many LTE-ready Apple Watch Series 7 sales. That has changed recently, as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFM35F9/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering the bigger 45mm LTE Apple Watch Series 7 selling at $509&lt;/a&gt;. That price applies to a few colorways with aluminum-clad cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XFpDz"&gt;If you want a best-ever price, check out the 45mm GPS and LTE Series 7 watches that have stainless steel cases. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Some of those are selling for $629&lt;/a&gt;, which is a whopping $120 discount from their normal $749 price. The Series 7 features an edge-to-edge display, which is larger than its predecessor, as well as IP6X dust resistance. It can track statistics like heart rate, blood oxygen, EKG, and more. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26269955.4573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzIyNTMzL2FwcGxlLXdhdGNoLXNlcmllcy03LXJldmlldy1zY3JlZW4td2F0Y2hvcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B0da29cbb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WkMSO7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z78XRP"&gt;Shifting away from great smartwatches to useful and fun smart bulbs, right now, Philips Hue is taking 20 percent off some of its most popular smart light bulbs, strips, and more during its mix-and-match sale that lasts until January 17th. To get the discount, which applies to the total purchase cost, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmX9FIUoZ0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;choose four items from this list&lt;/a&gt;. The new price will be reflected at checkout and your order will ship for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzxZDt"&gt;As for what the promo includes, there are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYa7ZbyWv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYbroZ5BP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three packs&lt;/a&gt; of Philips Hue A19 E26 white and color ambiance bulbs, which typically retail for $79.99 and $134.99, respectively. If you need to stock up on several bulbs, you stand to save a lot of money today. Though, understandably, you might not be in a position to put down that much cash. So if you prefer to buy just one kit, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant/dp/B07QV9XB87/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of white and color A19 ambiance bulbs for $109.99&lt;/a&gt; (usually $134.99).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMVOK"&gt;These smart bulbs can pair to your phone via Bluetooth or to your existing setup of Philips Hue bulbs via the Hue Bridge, which uses Zigbee. That latter connectivity allows for the likes of Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa to be able to control them. These bulbs support several color temperature options, adjustable smart timers, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleepbuds are small enough to fit snugly into your ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjNQfrOBCv32C7irpg2-e230IYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175615/akrales_201215_4331_0033.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nAwJSC"&gt;If one of your New Year’s resolutions is to get healthier, or practice better self-care, this deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt; may help. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sleepbuds-II-Technology-clinically/dp/B08FRR6Z1N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $249 earbuds are selling for an all-time low of $199 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmGkKbWpgY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Designed to help you sleep better, these small earbuds silence external sounds and replace them with a combination of relaxing sounds and music. Unlike its predecessor, which suffered from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899371/bose-sleepbuds-faulty-battery-issues-problem-refunds-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inconsistent battery life and abrupt shutdowns&lt;/a&gt;, these are apparently much improved per Barbara Krasnoff’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also comfortable to wear, effective at silencing a range of noises, and you can even them use to set an alarm or to be alerted to phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jtvbaP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965214"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SfO4a7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFJKK2T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo’s Essential indoor camera is selling for $78.49&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon, an all-time low price on this smart home device that usually costs $100. It launched last year, and alongside two-way talk capabilities, the Arlo Essential indoor camera offers a privacy shield to cover the lens, a siren, night vision support, a 1080p sensor, and a 130-degree field of view. While we’ve yet to test it for ourselves, our smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy notes Arlo’s cameras tend to be of good quality. However, as you’ll need to pay for the monthly subscription to be able to get the most use out of it, this is more of a must-see deal for those who may already have multiple Arlo cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jO0kyz"&gt;If you’re looking for a standalone camera, there are better, more affordable options on the market. The Blink Mini is one example, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $34.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9pF95d"&gt;Here are some other great deals going on:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U1gbcp"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced Garmin Venu 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524882/garmin-venu-2-fitness-watch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Venu 2&lt;/a&gt; is a great pick that boasts an array of sensors, ranging from a barometric altimeter for elevation to a thermometer, although it lacks a mic or speaker (both are found in the Venu 2 Plus). If those omissions don’t bother you, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smaller-Sized-Smartwatch-Monitoring-010-02429-02/dp/B0911XHHCN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Venu 2 for $349.99 instead of $399.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="52vf6c"&gt;Find your lost items quickly with the Tile Pro Bluetooth Tracker, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2WLRWX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is currently selling for $29.99&lt;/a&gt; — one of its best prices yet, down from $35. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="igxs8I"&gt;If you’re shopping for a budget-friendly streaming stick, Woot is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV stick&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDeals162022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Ffire-tv-stick-with-alexa-voice-remote-2020-release-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 (usually $39.99) until January 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The device works with older TVs, and you can search for shows and movies to watch using vocal commands with Alexa’s Voice Remote, which is included in the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>CES had a pretty good year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A BMW concept using e-ink to automatically change the paint color on a car from white to black and back again" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bJO2NqWdUmUgjGuobP-7_cVb3A=/34x0:4929x3263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358935/37_SW_FinBMW_iX_eInk_Seite_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A BMW concept using e-ink to automatically change the paint color on a car from white to black and back again&lt;/em&gt; | BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q83Crg"&gt;Another year of the Consumer Electronics Show has wrapped up, and it was a strange one: the weeks leading up to it were filled with cancellations due to Omicron, and as a result the show floor was virtually empty. The keynote presentations lacked the usual spectacle; the pomp was overshadowed by the circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O71uDU"&gt;Nevertheless, I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1478409885431730179"&gt;found myself surprised&lt;/a&gt; to realize that CES 2022 was a slightly better than average year for the show. There weren’t any industry-shaking products announced and shipping — but that almost never happens at CES, and the expectation that it should was always misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUZvUh"&gt;Instead, we saw some genuinely good improvements on technology that will actually ship, which isn’t always the case at CES. Here are just a few of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwTGGr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://t.co/wrON4JItQp"&gt;Dell’s XPS 13 Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a bold (maybe too bold) reimagining of a classic laptop design. It’s too bad the company mixed some interesting ideas with one obviously bad one: dropping the headphone jack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wvf4QH"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://t.co/klh9SpUVJ5"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://t.co/OU7KoJTwhC"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; both had chip announcements that should lead to some solid computers (although an M1-level revolution isn’t on the table for PCs yet). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GZRgF8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"&gt;smart home ecosystem is gearing&lt;/a&gt; up for a big year with more ambitious products designed to actually work together with the new Matter standard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lXt85I"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;curved monitor&lt;/a&gt; you can rotate 90 degrees so it swoops over your head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EGlBIJ"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858402/home-robot-labrador-caddie-retriever-smart-self-driving-shelf"&gt;home robot that could actually be useful&lt;/a&gt; because it doesn’t try to do anything too futuristic, just provide the service of helping people with mobility issues carry stuff around. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UnuVa6"&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;Quantum Dot OLED technology&lt;/a&gt; that should allow OLED screens to be much brighter — plus there’s the CES intrigue of Sony announcing a TV with a Samsung-made panel before Samsung itself announced a TV. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q7qdE8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds"&gt;portable projector that manages to solve for the actual hassles&lt;/a&gt; involved with portable projectors. It was almost like the product manager used these types of products and understood their problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OyO1R6"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866703/hp-elite-dragonfly-g3-chromebook-enterprise-laptops"&gt;Chromebook that slots into the high-end spot&lt;/a&gt; that’s been frustratingly empty for about two years now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="fUk2zN"&gt;Then there’s the stuff that will likely never ship but are worth examining as the concepts that they are. Not because they’re inspiring examples of hashtag-innovation, but because they reveal the id of consumer tech: companies that desperately want you to believe they’re innovative, environmentally friendly, and have multi-year roadmaps that are actually realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nb7Va"&gt;I’m talking about electric cars, of course. CES is just as much a car show as it is a gadget show — and the cars are all gadgets now, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9FqIj"&gt;There was one concept car that was just unabashedly fun because it was cool and because nobody pretended that it would turn into a real product. That would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867090/bmw-color-changing-paint-electric-car-ces"&gt;BMW’s use of E Ink on the body panels of an iX&lt;/a&gt; to give it the ability to change from black to white at the flip of a switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYZA56"&gt;But we sit in a strange time where every car manufacturer needs to earnestly project that they’re switching to electric but &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846960/electric-vehicles-car-companies-promises-ship-dates"&gt;most of them have yet to ship EVs at meaningful scale&lt;/a&gt;. Which means that CES 2022 was filled with more than its usual share of concept cars and paper-thin promises that in [insert year here], the company will be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tevrRd"&gt;The biggest car news of the show was undoubtedly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;, but it has a target ship date of late 2023, which is plenty of time for plans to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="66TCRJ"&gt;Mercedes-Benz had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22855555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-ev-range-ces-2022"&gt;DB5-looking concept&lt;/a&gt; whose purpose was to convince us that 600+ mile ranges could be easily achievable in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Itu06e"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868578/cadillac-av-concept-innerspace-ces-2022"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22862387/chrysler-electric-only-2028-airflow-concept-ces-2022"&gt;Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; both had concepts that aren’t really going anywhere (literally and figuratively, I suppose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NLQ05S"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866219/bmw-ix-m60-electric-vehicle-range-specs-date"&gt;BMW’s non-E-Ink iX M60 looks like a rad performance crossover&lt;/a&gt; and its summer 2022 release date seems promising. But the electric crossover space is awash in announced-but-barely-shipped EVs and so the burden of proof is on BMW to make this thing at volume. (The same burden lies on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces"&gt;Chevy’s promised $30k Equinox&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0wVFsj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866831/hyundai-robot-mobility-pnd-dnl-autonomous-ces"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867455/gm-sell-autonomous-vehicles-personally-owned-timeline"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22866190/volvo-ride-pilot-level-3-autonomous-subscription-california"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; each made bombastic autonomous driving claims when it would have been better to let the results speak for themselves when (or if) they actually happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o6Qr0z"&gt;Most egregiously of all to me, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867818/sony-mobility-cars-vision-prototype-ces-2022"&gt;Sony said it’s launching an entirely new company to “explore” getting into the car manufacturing game&lt;/a&gt; alongside revealing another concept vehicle. I would love to be proven wrong, but it read like a blatantly disingenuous grasp at attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zAUT81"&gt;So I am clearly put off by the concept cars this year — but I also have a modicum of sympathy because in this precise moment supply chain issues make ramping up any new thing difficult. CES is the place for tech hype, so it’s no surprise that car companies are participating in that. But when the hyped tech is a category of devices that could be an essential part of eliminating our use of fossil fuels, my sympathy doesn’t go as far as it otherwise would. We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; EVs to be real and widespread, so looking at concepts that are probably vaporware stings more than if it were a fancy monitor or a weird pretend robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BD24Pa"&gt;But look away from the concept cars (except the E Ink one — that one is still cool). There were plenty of pedestrian laptops, wearables, and various other gadgets that will surely come out this year and definitely seem like improvements on what came before. Nothing worthy of their own keynotes, but all in all a decent enough haul for a weird year at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fdshx"&gt;Here’s a representative example: one of the staff’s favorite announcements here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s 42-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt;. We loved it not because it was a massive, wall-sized TV but because it was small and useful. It fills a hole that needed to be filled — a TV with superb picture quality that works in a smaller room (or, alternately, a potentially cool option for a gaming monitor). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSyryb"&gt;Here’s one more: L’Oreal’s created a hair gadget that combines a dye cartridge with a brush with vibrating bristles. It handles the amount of dye and makes applying it much easier. It’s not Wi-Fi enabled. There is no app. It doesn’t support Bluetooth. It seems great in part because it lacks those things — and the time that would have been wasted building that tech in was instead put into designing it for its actual purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIVyVZ"&gt;That’s what I mean when I say it was a pretty good year for CES. There were more gadgets that seemed more useful this year, making the vaporware easier to ignore. Practicality: what a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Echo Show update adds more live video news providers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pvDM7VaiI_MvN54hQ20hgQyTyrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358744/dseifert_210219_4433_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s Echo Show 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qlwu7n"&gt;Amazon has announced a couple of small quality of life improvements for different Alexa devices. Its Echo Show lineup of smart displays are getting more live video news content in the US and an easier way to navigate news channels. Meanwhile, mobile Alexa devices are also gaining the ability to share your ETA while you’re using their navigation features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dW1DGQ"&gt;The new live video content providers for Echo Show owners in the US are from People TV, ET Live, and Bloomberg TV Plus. Amazon says it has more on the way soon. These new channels, as well as the Echo Show’s existing library of live video and on demand audio news channels, can now be accessed via a new provider list that’ll be displayed at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1zVjEm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live content from People TV, ET Live, and Bloomberg TV Plus is now available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UoUyNC"&gt;As well as offering manual selection, compatible Echo Show devices can also personalize the news they show you by listening to your voice using Voice ID, or your appearance using Visual ID. Visual ID launched alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23615589011"&gt;also available&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10 (3rd gen)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 8 (2nd gen)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkqaQm"&gt;If you’re the kind of person that uses Alexa for navigation on devices like the Echo Auto, Echo Buds, Echo Frames, or a car with Alexa built-in, then the new ETA sharing feature could be a useful addition. Amazon says asking Alexa to “share my ETA home” will announce your predicted arrival time to your other Alexa-enabled devices like smart speakers. If your mobile Alexa device is paired with an Android smartphone you can also send an ETA via text by saying “Alexa, share my ETA with X,” where “X” is the name of one of your contacts. Alexa’s navigation feature draws from the default navigation app on your paired smartphone, according to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=help_search_1-4&amp;amp;nodeId=GA2XEQXBHZUAA6HJ&amp;amp;qid=1641559142721&amp;amp;sr=1-4"&gt;Amazon’s support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord hacking is the newest threat for NFT buyers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TICXBLmVGxyF_XOuxVRXsrpAeA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358664/acastro_210106_4957_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;One compromised admin account led to two projects being scammed in a day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fWvBB5"&gt;On Tuesday, December 21st, two NFT projects fell victim to the same attack. Like many projects in the crypto world, the NFT collection Monkey Kingdom and in-game asset marketplace Fractal both engaged heavily with their communities through Discord chat servers. Both projects were about to distribute rewards to their community members: Monkey Kingdom through an NFT presale on the day of the 21st and Fractal through a token airdrop — essentially a free distribution to early supporters — a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZS5C6"&gt;Then, disaster struck. Posts appeared in the official “announcements” channel of each project claiming that a surprise mint would reward community members with a limited edition NFT. Hundreds jumped at the chance — but for those who followed the links and connected their crypto wallets, a costly surprise was waiting. Rather than receiving an NFT, wallets were being drained of the Solana cryptocurrency, which both projects used for purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiSUnZ"&gt;In the space of an hour, a Twitter post, first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeyKingdom_/status/1473312369556213769"&gt;from Monkey Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1473328245030277122"&gt;then from Fractal&lt;/a&gt;, informed followers that their Discord servers had been hacked; news of the NFT mints was bogus, the links a phishing fraud. In the case of Fractal, the scammers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848840/scammers-steal-crypto-nft-project-fractal-discord-hack-solana"&gt;got away with about $150,000 worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;. For Monkey Kingdom, the estimated total was &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-nft-project-monkey-kingdom-loses-1-3m-in-phishing-hack-launches-compensation-fund"&gt;reported to be $1.3 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bhku8l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4nfzb"&gt;Neither attack targeted the blockchain or the tokens themselves. Instead, the thieves exploited weaknesses in the infrastructure used to sell the tokens — specifically, the Discord chatrooms where NFT fans gather. It’s a reminder of a persistent weakness in the growing NFT economy, where surprise drops have primed buyers to move fast or risk missing out. But the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers — and in this case, a single compromise can end up spreading to more than one community at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUsofG"&gt;In this case, the NFTs thieves had targeted a feature known as a webhook. Webhooks are used by many web applications (Discord included) to listen for a message sent to a particular URL and trigger an event in response, like posting content to a certain channel. You can think of a webhook like a secret phone number, a unique identifier that can be “called” (or, in a closer approximation, “texted”) to connect to an application on the other end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7c06SM"&gt;By gaining access to webhooks belonging to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord servers, the hackers were able to send messages that were broadcast to all members of certain channels: a feature meant to be used only for official communications from the project teams. This was where the fake “announcement” had come from and why it had pointed to a scam address. In hindsight, the content should have raised some red flags — but given the distribution method, it looked just legitimate enough that many were fooled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="l5IiLd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TODSKE"&gt;Discord webhooks are used to automate messages based on activities in other applications: for example, the &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; describes making a bot that notifies a channel of new GitHub commits. But it’s easy to lose track of those bots amid the various third-party service integrations, and crucially, there’s no way to switch off all of them at once if you’ve been hacked. The result is a major opportunity for attackers and a liability for any Discord communities who aren’t paying attention to their integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6tDQW"&gt;A Discord spokesperson said the company cautioned people to be careful when giving others access to their devices and personal information and pointed to guidance made available through its Moderator Academy &lt;a href="https://discord.com/moderation"&gt;resource center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKP4j2"&gt;“Discord takes the safety of all users and communities very seriously, including social engineering attacks like these,” said Peter Day, senior manager of corporate communications at Discord. “While there are clear controls in place, we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LuHYgv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WNBHhq"&gt;The origin of the hack appears to have been a service called Grape Network, which provides community management tools to Fractal, Monkey Kingdom, and hundreds of other crypto projects that used Discord. Roughly a week before the cryptocurrency theft, an employee of Grape Network going by the screen name Arximedis had been caught by a separate scam on another Discord server entirely, this one belonging to Solana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7UPQs"&gt;By first manipulating a Solana moderator, then Arximedis himself, through a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LittlelemonsNFT/status/1477923368053706755"&gt;phishing attack that involves getting the target banned&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers had managed to obtain an account access token that let them perform actions on behalf of the Grape administrator. It was enough to let them create an avenue to send messages to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord channels. With the groundwork in place, the hackers kept quiet and waited for a time to strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ND5ctD"&gt;Grape Network founder Dean Pappas confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his colleague had been the target of the initial hack and that this first hack had been exploited to create the webhooks that were used in the second. “This is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism,” Pappas said. “It’s a very difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZRRCB"&gt;In a statement sent via Twitter, the head of the Monkey Kingdom project (who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym “Monkey King”) said that additional security measures had now been put in place to avoid future attacks and ensure the safety of users. The Monkey King also pointed to the money raised by the project to refund victims of the scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nz8Zj"&gt;NFT projects are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because they move so quickly. Hyped projects often sell out within hours — or sometimes minutes — so early adopters are conditioned to act fast. And Discord, now the go-to platform for NFT communities, is where the early intel on presales and airdrops is released first. That means community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge, which, in turn, lets scammers leverage fake messages to devastating effect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E5XCGu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMfTtu"&gt;In the most heated drops, making a successful transaction can be difficult even for the early movers. &lt;a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/nft-market-report.html"&gt;A Chainalysis examination&lt;/a&gt; of one popular project showed that more than 26,000 unsuccessful mint transactions occurred within the first hour after launch, each of which used up nonrefundable transaction fees. All told, more than $4 million was spent on gas fees for unsuccessful transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0CBHH"&gt;There’s no indication yet that the NFT craze will slow in 2022, which means there’ll be no shortage of new projects looking to scale by using off-the-shelf solutions to build their infrastructure. There are signs that Discord, the beating social pulse of the NFT community, is also a goldmine for unscrupulous individuals looking to separate marks from their hard-earned coins — but perhaps as techniques of moderation and server administration in the community improve, more rigorous management of problem areas (like webhooks and third-party plugins) will reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="amkDkT"&gt;The good news is that, for the two projects affected by this particular hack, there may be sunnier days ahead. Fractal, the game asset marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/30/justin-kans-gaming-nft-platform-goes-live-rebounding-from-150k-discord-exploit/"&gt;went live&lt;/a&gt; on the penultimate day of 2021. And having reimbursed money that was lost by members, Monkey Kingdom is relaunching the NFT line that was interrupted by the hack. The community is loyal, the Monkey King told us, and fans are once again ready to pick up a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
