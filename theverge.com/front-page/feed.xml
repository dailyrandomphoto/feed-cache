    <title>Inside Facebook’s metaverse for work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lz8RLdK_0_-uV1dmer4yVvmWKgs=/135x0:1547x941/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746469/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_5.37.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook is bringing the office to VR with Horizon Workrooms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XoPD9c"&gt;It wasn’t long into a recent press briefing I attended in virtual reality when Mark Zuckerberg showed up to talk about the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaltvD"&gt;I was sitting at a long, U-shaped conference table with a handful of other reporters, our floating torsos bobbing over our chairs, as the Facebook CEO beamed in. A giant, floating display nearby showed other Facebook employees dialed in from the non-VR world to watch us through their computer screens. It was there that Zuckerberg first appeared through his webcam before donning a headset and teleporting into a chair at the table as his own legless avatar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JDji4"&gt;We were there to preview a new app, which Facebook is describing as an “open beta,” for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt; called Horizon Workrooms. It’s the social network’s first stab at creating a VR experience specifically for people to work together in. After spending over an hour in Workrooms, I can see its potential as a more immersive way to communicate with people who are physically apart, but I don’t see it catching on beyond the most diehard VR enthusiasts anytime soon. That said, I can see this experience become compelling for more casual users, and potentially those who are totally new to VR, in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mG7ik4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10708748"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWKeRq"&gt;While an incremental update to Facebook’s VR efforts in its own right, Workrooms fits into the social network’s broader ambitions to own the next computing platform and build the so-called metaverse. Zuckerberg went so far as to recently say he wants Facebook to be primarily thought of as a metaverse company—a sci-fi concept that says we will all one day spend significant chunks of time in a fully immersive, digital space. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Or as Zuckerberg puts it, an “embodied internet.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BHsoS"&gt;What impressed me the most about Workrooms is the way that it brings parts of the outside world into VR. Up to 16 people in VR can be in a Workroom together, while an additional 34 people can join over video call without wearing a headset. A companion desktop app lets you beam a live feed of your computer screen over your virtual table space. Thanks to the Quest’s hand-tracking and front-facing cameras, a virtual representation of your physical keyboard sits underneath your screen for typing into a barebones web app Facebook built for note taking and managing calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GAAzCh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it might be the most intense VR application that exists”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="T6Oh09"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Horizon: Boz|103541" data-volume-uuid="8ecab1579" data-volume-id="103541" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-96" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Facebook Reality Labs VP&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kcY2Ks"&gt;“I think it might be the most intense VR application that exists, in terms of how much we’re trying to put every bell and whistle from the headset into the experience you’re using,” Facebook’s top AR/VR executive, Andrew Bosworth, told us during the briefing, which was the first of its kind I’ve experienced entirely in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VphqRk"&gt;For now, the process of getting into Workrooms initially is quite clunky. It oddly requires creating a separate Workrooms account through the web, downloading Workrooms in Oculus, and then pairing your headset to your Workrooms account by entering a code shown in the headset on your computer’s web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AK8gd7"&gt;Some features in Workrooms, like a personal drawing pad and giant whiteboard that anyone can go up to and use, feel more gimmicky than useful. There were multiple times when the audio cut out or became garbled, and the Quest’s hand tracking isn’t perfect. At one point Zuckerberg had to leave and rejoin the room because his avatar’s mouth wasn’t moving at all when he spoke. The desktop companion app isn’t yet compatible with Apple’s M1 processor, so I wasn’t able to try it on my 2020 MacBook Air. (A Facebook rep told me support is coming soon for Apple M1 computers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4atMns"&gt;Even with the bugs and relatively scaled-back graphics of the Quest compared to my MacBook screen, I still felt more present in Workrooms than I normally do in a traditional video conferencing setup like Zoom. Native arm and hand tracking, down to the movements of individual fingers, certainly helped. A larger factor is the Quest’s spatial audio. When someone talked in one corner of the room, it sounded like their voice was coming from that direction. At one point the seating chart was changed and I felt as if someone sitting behind me in VR was actually speaking from behind my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jbuI7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A much richer way to interact than the types of social apps we’ve been able to build on phones or computers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snudvu"&gt;Facebook has been using Workrooms internally for meetings for about six months, according to Zuckerberg. “These kinds of experiences, where you can actually feel present with other people, are I think a much richer way to interact than the types of social apps we’ve been able to build on phones or computers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="bqGw22"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Horizon: Zuckerberg|103542" data-volume-uuid="5fa2b9791" data-volume-id="103542" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-808" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg during a meeting in Horizon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pex3iP"&gt;Zuckerberg is right that VR feels more immersive than a phone or computer screen. But Workrooms — and the hardware that powers it — has a ways to go before it will be compelling enough to replace existing ways people work together and hang out at scale. But at the rate that Facebook’s Oculus hardware and software have been progressing, I expect experiences like Workrooms to be much more accessible and enticing in a couple of years than they are now. Other coming entrants into the space, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;such as Apple&lt;/a&gt;, will likely accelerate consumer interest in these sorts of headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNH9J1"&gt;Workrooms is part of a bigger umbrella project Facebook is building for Oculus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405249/facebook-vr-space-horizon-access-public-beta"&gt;called Horizon&lt;/a&gt;. Originally teased a couple of years ago, Horizon aims to essentially be the full Facebook universe — a metaverse, you could say — for virtual reality. Workrooms will be part of it, and Facebook has in the past demoed games and world-building tools similar to Minecraft or Roblox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeNrqS"&gt;Despite originally saying Horizon would debut in 2020, the experience remains in invite-only beta, and Facebook’s Bosworth declined to give me an exact timeframe for when that would change. He said the company has been focused on building more tools for creators, so they in turn can build things in Horizon for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji0xWm"&gt;That indicates Facebook wants Horizon to be a platform for other developers to build upon. Until Horizon comes out, Workrooms is the best glimpse yet at what Facebook means when it says it’s building the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DTS’s Play-Fi multiroom audio platform is getting a big home theater upgrade  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d39Ig4yF2r4vkxNxLdLWnLzg5y4=/108x0:747x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746381/news_main_image_play_fi_home_theater_854_426_90_s_c1_smart_scale.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DTS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0OhAR"&gt;Play-Fi, the multiroom audio platform from DTS, is getting a home theater upgrade with &lt;a href="https://play-fi.com/news/introducing-dts-play-fi-home-theater"&gt;Play-Fi Home Theater&lt;/a&gt;, a new set of wireless audio features designed to cut down on the amount of cables needed when using a TV with external speakers. Play-Fi Home Theater works using a TV’s built-in Wi-Fi with “no adapters, no dongles, and no add-on boxes” according to DTS, and is launching with as-yet unnamed TVs in the third quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWLsaA"&gt;DTS’s Play-Fi standard has been around for close to a decade, and is designed to let you build up a multiroom audio setup using speakers and other components from different manufacturers. That’s in contrast to systems like Sonos, which only streams to Sonos-branded equipment. The standard can already be used to pair Play-Fi wireless speakers to &lt;a href="https://play-fi.com/faq/entry/set-up-play-fi-surround"&gt;use as surrounds with a Play-Fi soundbar&lt;/a&gt;, but now compatible TVs will support a wider range of setups natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IpsGFx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Including support for up to two subwoofers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="15qtLg"&gt;According to DTS, Play-Fi Home Theatre-enabled TVs will be able to wirelessly output audio to a Play-Fi soundbar, or to wireless speakers to use as front or surround channels. There’s also support for up to two wireless subwoofers, or the option to use your TV’s built-in speakers as part of a surround sound setup. The latter case might end up sounding a little odd given the huge disparity in quality between the built-in audio in most TVs compared to standalone speakers, but it could work as a compromise as you build up a setup over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUfQCF"&gt;“Consumers no longer need to compromise aesthetics for an improved audio experience,” says DTS Play-Fi’s general manager Dannie Lau, “They can attain better sound quality simply by using a wireless subwoofer placed out of sight or build a high-performance home theater using a full complement of wireless speakers and subwoofers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSJZB9"&gt;DTS says Play-Fi already works with “hundreds” of speakers, TVs, soundbars, set-top boxes, and AV receivers across over 30 brands. When Play-Fi Home Theater launches, that means there shouldn’t be a shortage of audio accessories to connect to a compatible TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBOlaR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsGgPF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The four numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on your iPhone in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0KjEChXYRpIWUyntPLuKLncQIY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746379/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjAvk0"&gt;Apple is censoring words and phrases customers can engrave on products in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, according to a new report by the &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/"&gt;Brussels-based CitizenLab&lt;/a&gt;. The iPhone-maker has always said it filters engraving requests to avoid racist language, vulgarities, or intellectual property violations, but CitizenLab says the company’s restrictions of political references in Hong Kong and Taiwan particularly go above and beyond legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMMu8I"&gt;“We found that part of Apple’s mainland China political censorship bleeds into both Hong Kong and Taiwan,” &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/engrave-danger-an-analysis-of-apple-engraving-censorship-across-six-regions/"&gt;write the report’s authors&lt;/a&gt;. “Much of this censorship exceeds Apple’s legal obligations in Hong Kong, and we are aware of no legal justification for the political censorship of content in Taiwan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3S8wF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New report reveals extent of Apple’s engraving filters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSdepm"&gt;Apple does not offer a complete list of banned phrases by region, but analysis by CitizenLab found that the company filters 1,045 keywords in China, compared to 542 in Hong Kong, 397 in Taiwan, 206 in Canada, 192 in Japan, and 170 in the United States. While no political phrases are filtered in the US, Canada, or Japan, nearly half of all blocked keywords in China and Hong Kong were political in nature. CitizenLab’s analysis looked specifically at engraving requests for AirTags and iPads, but the only differences it noted in restrictions between the products were related to keyword length and lowercase words.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL6XsgoB1Q6qDdxsYkNIjx-Kf3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792056/Image_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/engrave-danger-an-analysis-of-apple-engraving-censorship-across-six-regions/" target="_blank"&gt;CitizenLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparisons of filtered keywords by type and region. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rReEyi"&gt;Keywords filtered in China include 政治 (politics), 抵制 (resist), 民主潮 (wave of democracy), and 人权 (human rights). For AirTag engravings, which are limited to four characters, Chinese customers are not allowed to use the four numbers 8964 — which refer to the Tiananmen Square protests, which took place on June 4th, 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moS0VZ"&gt;CitizenLab says the rigorous censorship applied in mainland China bleeds into Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong is a “special administrative region” of China that has enjoyed a high level of political independence, though China has cracked down on its democratic movements in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/briefing/china-hong-kong-apple-daily-closure.html"&gt;recent months and years&lt;/a&gt;. Taiwan, meanwhile, is a self-governing democracy that China considers to be a breakaway state that should reunite with the mainland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3j54d"&gt;In Hong Kong, banned phrases include 雙普選 (double universal suffrage), 雨伞革命 (Umbrella Revolution), and 新聞自由 (freedom of the press). In Taiwan, Apple customers are not allowed to reference high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party like 孫春蘭 (Sun Chunlan) or the banned religious movement 法輪功 (Falun Gong). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oM3WJ-Qxce9yANv1eetKbqHf3jY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792058/Image_2.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;8964: a reference to the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4 1989.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xGcWpD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there exists no legal obligation for Apple to perform such political censorship in Taiwan”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4sAup"&gt;CitizenLab notes that “there exists no legal obligation for Apple to perform such political censorship in Taiwan.” But Apple has repeatedly showed it will make political accommodations to preserve its presence in China, which accounts for nearly a fifth of its total revenues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MabnH"&gt;The degree to which Apple is willing to bend to Chinese pressure has become particularly sensitive in recent weeks after the iPhone-maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;unveiled a controversial system&lt;/a&gt; to detect CSAM (child sexual abuse material) on its devices. The system scans users’ phones locally for the illegal material, but critics worry that it could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;expanded beyond CSAM&lt;/a&gt; to detect other forms of illegal content. In China, that could include expression of political dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jhZH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Citizen-Lab-Letter-08172021.pdf"&gt;responded to the analysis&lt;/a&gt; by CitizenLab by saying it filters engraving requests with respect to “local laws, rules, and regulations.” It did not address any criticism that it was over-zealous in its censorship in Hong Kong and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRpSAL"&gt;“We handle engraving requests regionally. There is no single global list that contains one set of words or phrases,” said Apple’s chief privacy officer Jane Horvath, in a letter. “Instead, these decisions are made through a review process where our teams assess local laws as well as their assessment of cultural sensitivities.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Twitter should copy from Tinder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ysm4lS54eJ5Iws68gyWoToyEukY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746331/acastro_180822_1777_tinder_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You’ll likely be able to verify yourself twice on Tinder before you can do it once anywhere else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="zkwSod"&gt;One of the core subjects I cover is the still-emerging field that tech companies call &lt;em&gt;trust and safety&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the time, it’s safety that grabs the headlines: hate speech on Facebook; Apple scanning devices for images of child abuse; COVID misinformation on YouTube. Today I want to talk about the trust side of the equation — specifically how platforms verify profiles. More specifically, why they should verify &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; profiles, if you want them to. No matter who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEmOnj"&gt;Verification might seem like a dry subject, but those little checkmarks mean a lot to people. (You learn this once you get your checkmark, and friends and family immediately start asking how they can get theirs, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trPKGY"&gt;They also wind up embarrassing online platforms on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7XkCLd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter hadn’t anticipated the authenticity of rank-and-file workers would ever be up for scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nzuPqA"&gt;In April, I wrote about&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/amazon-fights-off-its-twitter-impersonators"&gt; the case of Amazon’s Twitter army&lt;/a&gt;. At the height of Amazon’s labor battle in Bessemer, Alabama, there was no way to distinguish between workers who actually represented Amazon, and those who were posting satirically. Twitter’s verification program, which it had just spent &lt;em&gt;three years &lt;/em&gt;overhauling, had not anticipated a case in which the authenticity of rank-and-file workers would ever be up for scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSgMZ3"&gt;Then, last week, Twitter shut down its entire verification program again, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;falsely verifying at least six bot accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623714/twitter-verification-program-pause-fake-accounts-review"&gt;Mitchell Clark for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KjHeEY"&gt;Twitter is halting the expansion of its verification program, saying it needs to work on the application and review process that lets people into the blue check mark club. This change, where Twitter won’t be letting new people apply for verification, is coming after Twitter admitted that several fake accounts, which reportedly seemed to be part of a botnet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;were incorrectly verified&lt;/a&gt;. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtgIG8"&gt;This isn’t the first time Twitter has paused its verification program — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;put the public process on hold in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, after it received backlash for verifying one of the organizers behind the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville. It brought back a revamped version in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;and paused it a week later&lt;/a&gt; due to an avalanche of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QdRkSy"&gt;Baked into Twitter’s approach is the idea that verification should be rare and precious — reserved for “notable” accounts only. Facebook and Instagram take a similar approach. One of my core beliefs is that reserving verification for “notable” accounts actually &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; trust in networks overall. it reserves special privileges for elites — like customer service — that should be available to all; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16631774/twitter-verification-kessler-milo-abuse"&gt;it confers moral authority on whoever manages to get a checkmark&lt;/a&gt;, even if they are one of the worst actors on the network; and, of course, It breeds contempt between regular users and “bluechecks.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puA1Ku"&gt;Now, maybe at this point you’re saying: &lt;em&gt;great, thanks Casey. Another intractable platform problem that shall haunt us as long as we live&lt;/em&gt;. Not so! For another platform has tackled the problem of user authenticity in a totally different way, and the results have been … pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyE2bv"&gt;The platform is Tinder, Match Group’s popular dating app. In April&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/amazon-fights-off-its-twitter-impersonators"&gt; I wrote about the app’s move last year&lt;/a&gt; to let anyone verify their account by sending in a few selfies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TV6jvm"&gt;Upon request, Tinder sends the user a picture of a model performing specific poses. Users take selfies in the poses shown and submit them to Tinder; photos are reviewed by its community team. If the user’s poses match the model’s, they get a blue checkmark. The process takes about a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFA3Ij"&gt;Catfishing remains a significant problem on dating apps, so self-serve verification like this addresses an obvious problem. And while a blue checkmark on Tinder doesn’t tell you &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you need to know about a potential date, it dramatically increases the odds that the person you’re talking to at least looks like their picture. The benefits are significant enough that, from what I can tell, the majority of Tinder users in my area have now verified their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8e9sts"&gt;Tinder could have stopped there. But executives noted that their approach to verification was limited in one significant way: a significant number of Tinder users do not display images of themselves for safety reasons — particularly women and LGBTQ+ people outside of the United States. Many of these users could still benefit from verifying that they are authentic human beings looking for romance and friendship, and not bots or scammers. But if they declined to upload photos of themselves, how could they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF0SdK"&gt;This week, Tinder&lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category"&gt; said it is developing a solution to that problem&lt;/a&gt;. The company is preparing to release a second, complementary form of verification for users who don’t want to show their face. Instead of verifying a user’s identity via photos, Tinder will ask them for another form of verification — a drivers’ license, for example. (The company said it would “take into consideration expert recommendations, input from our members, what documents are most appropriate in each country, and local laws and regulations, as it determines how the feature will roll out.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fbJaq3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many users could benefit from verifying they are authentic human beings, not bots or scammers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TrXgPJ"&gt;“An ID verification offers that person a way to say, I’ve proven to Tinder that I’m real, without having to necessarily show their face if that’s something you’re not comfortable doing,” said Rory Kozoll, head of trust and safety product at Tinder, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpKinc"&gt;The feature is still in development, and there is no timeline for its release (beyond “in the coming quarters”). But Tinder has been testing ID verification in Japan since 2019, and the company says it has worked well enough there that it is planning to release it globally. When that happens, you could choose to verify yourself both through your photos &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your ID, with both checks appearing on your profile. (The company hasn’t decided exactly how it will represent this visually on the profile.) And as Tinder gets more and more people to participate, trust in its network will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49VlBv"&gt;“We’ve heard from customers from the beginning that authenticity was the biggest issue they had,” said Kozoll, who joined Tinder four years ago. “Just knowing: is this person who they say they are?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IjfId"&gt;The company declined to tell me how many people have chosen to verify their profiles, but said it’s by far the most popular safety-related feature the company has introduced to date. Tinder also said verified profiles are more likely to “have success” on Tinder — more matches, more conversations. It’s also helping the company counter the perception that its app, like any dating app, is overrun with catfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CouUzt"&gt;“We’re definitely starting to see in our survey data and qualitative research that people are turning the corner on that,” Kozoll said. “Starting to feel like more of the people they see on Tinder are real. And we can correlate it with the introduction and adoption of photo verification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdhFCo"&gt;Kozoll told me that, as on Twitter, users are sometimes verified even when they don’t match. But “the volume is extremely low, almost to be statistically insignificant,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrcmAe"&gt;In any case, he said, the benefits to verifying anyone who asks have outweighed the risks of the occasional false positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="02jjRw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Starting to feel like more of the people they see on Tinder are real”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qFAfbX"&gt;Looking at Tinder’s success here, I can’t help but wonder what would happen if Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or even YouTube took a similar approach. (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3046484?hl=en"&gt;You need 100,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to request verification on YouTube.) Photo verification could help platforms sort out human beings from bots — an increasingly urgent need in a world where&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/2/15/18226005/ai-generated-fake-people-portraits-thispersondoesnotexist-stylegan"&gt; images generated by artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; can often fool the naked eye. ID verification could help people prove their authenticity even if they aren’t considered notable figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8P6sMc"&gt;I’d also love to see platforms let people optionally verify their employers through an email address, so we’d know if all those scientists, academics, and law enforcement officers are who they say they are, whenever events conspire to bring them into the daily news cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qK4MlY"&gt;I asked Kozoll to what extent he thought Tinder’s verification measures could be adopted by the industry at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnsUf8"&gt;“I don’t want to presume to know more about other businesses than they do,” he said. “But I think what we’re doing today is a viable approach for dating apps.” He noted that Tinder’s ideas here are not totally original — the company took inspiration from gig economy startups that require drivers to verify their photos in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4uG6U"&gt;“I think businesses that are bringing people together in real life … have more interest in making sure that those people have a higher level of authenticity,” he said. “The same rules may apply more broadly in social media, but I understand the concerns around free speech and anonymity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ivS85"&gt;But the key lesson from Tinder is that verification doesn’t have to be a binary, yes-or-no choice. Platforms can choose to let users verify aspects of their identity in different ways, granting different badges or other benefits based on what people choose to share. If they do, I imagine they’ll see what Tinder did: a network where, over time, more people come to trust one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ul5Z0v"&gt;In the meantime, you’re likely to be able to verify yourself twice on Tinder before you can do it once anywhere else. As Twitter reconsiders how to verify its user base yet again, Tinder has offered it a compelling roadmap. Here’s hoping Twitter swipes it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia expects GPU supply constraints for the ‘vast majority’ of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-EnsNvIHD8aKs42OoXQAdtcZ4ik=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746323/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 GPU.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3jCyia"&gt;Nvidia warned earlier this year that the great GPU shortage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;would last throughout 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company expects supply issues to continue well into 2022. Speaking on Nvidia’s Q2 fiscal 2022 earnings call this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he expects supply constraints for the majority of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8dtVo"&gt;“I would expect that we will see a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment,” said Huang &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4450523-nvidia-corporation-nvda-ceo-jensen-huang-on-q2-2022-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;according to a transcript of the call&lt;/a&gt;, spotted by &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-expects-supply-constraints-for-the-vast-majority-of-next-year"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Videocardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia has committed to securing long-term supply commitments, but demand is still higher than supply right now during a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUgLsJ"&gt;Nvidia’s warnings of a GPU shortage well into 2022 might not seem as bad as they sound, though. Anecdotally, we’ve noticed Nvidia managing to resupply a range of its GPUs across both Europe and the US more frequently in recent weeks than we’ve seen since the RTX 30-series debuted last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/46R4nBDCfX0sp1eMlA6Kufpuq2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772009/twarren_210809_4700_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s RX 6600 XT GPUs are still available at some UK retailers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NdSMUP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;AMD’s RX 6600 XT GPUs also sold&lt;/a&gt; at or under their recommended retail price recently, with plenty of the cards still in stock at UK retailers. It’s still not easy to just go out and buy the exact GPU you want, but it certainly feels like things are getting slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39nHw6"&gt;Despite the shortages, Nvidia still managed to hit a &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2022"&gt;record revenue of $6.51 billion&lt;/a&gt; this quarter — up 68 percent year over year. Gaming made up $3.06 billion of Nvidia’s overall revenue, a big jump of 85 percent over the year prior. The company is now shipping most (80 percent) of its PC gaming GPUs with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;Lite Hash Rate enabled&lt;/a&gt; to combat cryptomining demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4d5sSo"&gt;While the gaming segment is clearly thriving at Nvidia, the company’s new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) failed to hit Nvidia’s own predictions. CMP only hit $266 million in revenue, compared to the $400 million the company had predicted. China’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;cryptocurrency crackdown&lt;/a&gt; has likely affected CMP sales, with miners &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/cryptocurrency-miners-in-china-are-beginning-to-sell-off-gpus-for-cheap/"&gt;selling off used GPUs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia admits acquisition of British chip designer Arm may take longer than 18 months </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9uiX2A8dEyU_EDl-7AlX7m2NOjo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746239/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6hfNf"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has admitted for the first time that the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;planned acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of British chip designer Arm may take longer than the initially-scheduled 18 months. The acquisition, which would bring together two of the most powerful chip companies in the world, is facing scrutiny from regulators in the US, UK, and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGuYme"&gt;“Our discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, so it’s pushing out the timetable,” Huang &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3758929d-66f0-4095-94f3-ea62b92f9480"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s not one particular delay,” he added. “But we’re confident in the deal, we’re confident regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CTdVwR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oC6Q3V"&gt;Huang was previously unwavering in his prediction that the acquisition would be completed by March next year. The agreement between Nvidia and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;Arm’s current owner SoftBank&lt;/a&gt; gives the US chip designer until the end of 2022 to clear the purchase with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkjveQ"&gt;The opposition to the deal is varied and speaks to Arm’s global importance. In the UK, for example, regulators are investigating the purchase on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;national security grounds&lt;/a&gt;, but politicians have also decried the takeover as a blow to Britain’s tech industry and its sovereignty on the global stage. In the US, the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the acquisition after Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm complained it would limit competition. And in China, control of the globally-critical chip industry is seen as an important geopolitical battleground with the US. Chinese regulators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17614218/qualcomm-nxp-merger-fails-breakup-fee"&gt;previously nixed&lt;/a&gt; an attempt by American firm Qualcomm to buy Dutch manufacturer NXP Semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TS7505"&gt;Much of the scrutiny is due to Arm’s ubiquity and perceived neutrality in the global chip business. The company sells designs to a variety of firms including Apple, Amazon, and Samsung. And while its ownership by SoftBank was seen as unproblematic as the Japanese corporation does not compete directly with these companies, there are more potential conflicts under Nvidia’s ownership, especially as Arm’s chips are increasingly favored for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAsVqp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s new true wireless earbuds are designed to help cope with hearing loss</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3Al3wGm7_JzHZp89gvUBGIqP78=/0x0:4428x2952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746217/Jabra_Enhance_Angle_4b_Dark_Grey_LB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Enhance Plus.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jabra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rlbo7i"&gt;Jabra’s Enhance Plus are a new pair of true wireless earbuds aimed at helping people who experience “mild-to-moderate” hearing loss. They’re meant as a half-step towards a more traditional hearing aid solution, for people who might not be ready to wear a device all day. The Enhance Plus will be released first in the US at the end of the year, and will be sold through licensed hearing care professionals at a price that’s yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caUSRy"&gt;Although Jabra is perhaps best known for its true wireless earbuds like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Elite 85T&lt;/a&gt;, its parent company GN Group has a long history in the hearing aid business. Now Jabra is also getting involved. It announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.gn.com/Newsroom/News/2021/June/GN-launches-high-quality-Jabra-Enhance-Pro-hearing-aids"&gt;hearing aid lineup in June&lt;/a&gt;, and last year it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273578/jabra-elite-75t-customizable-controls-mysound-hearing-test-now-available"&gt;hearing test feature&lt;/a&gt; to its true wireless earbuds, to customize their sound to your hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SMpSkNVM5-e3jVtR8WFbPs46SE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792040/Jabra_Enhance_Angle_7_Dark_Grey_LB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Jabra&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds in their charging case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="icvGdI"&gt;The Enhance Plus are designed to be discrete, and are half as small as Jabra’s Elite 75T earbuds. But despite this, they also offer a respectable 10 hours of battery life, or 30 hours total when used with the charging case. They use beamforming to isolate sounds and amplify what you’re listening to, and offer noise reduction and feedback suppression features to cut out unwanted background noise. There’s also a companion mobile app to tweak The Enhance Plus’s settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6eqez"&gt;Since they’ve got the form-factor of a pair of true wireless earbuds, the Enhance Plus can also be used like a traditional pair of headphones to stream music or make calls from a paired smartphone. They’re IP52 rated for dust and water resistance, and will be sold in gray and beige. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADJRcC"&gt;Recently, other headphone manufacturers have shown a similar interest in designing or tailoring their products towards people who experience hearing loss. Bose announced its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430485/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aid-fda-cleared"&gt;hearing aid in May&lt;/a&gt;, while in June Apple announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;“Conversation Boost” software feature&lt;/a&gt; for its AirPods Pro, which is designed to amplify the sound of people speaking. And they’re unlikely to be the last, after hearing aid manufacturer Sonova recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424367/sonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars"&gt;bought headphone manufacturer Sennheiser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWxcjX"&gt;Oppo has held a “Future Imaging Technology Launch Event” online today to make some camera-related announcements, following the reveal of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;“next-generation” under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7VVzV"&gt;Oppo is known for demonstrating camera tech in prototype form long before it hits the market. The company was the first to demonstrate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/1/14755916/oppo-5x-zoom-camera-prototype-hands-on-mwc-2017"&gt;periscope telephoto cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;under-display cameras&lt;/a&gt;, for example, both of which are increasingly common on high-end devices.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fNJC898kmxEfv5pPpmBaudV1ks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792007/OPPO_Continuous_Optical_Zoom_2021.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EZNGtf"&gt;The first new announcement is a telephoto lens with continuous optical zoom. Unlike periscope telephoto lenses used today, the lens elements move throughout the 85-200mm-equivalent zoom range meaning that the images should be crisp at every focal length without the need for digital zoom, cropping, or artificial sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9vdWh"&gt;Vivo announced a similar product for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21157292/vivo-apex-2020-concept-phone-cameras-screen-specs"&gt;Apex 2020 concept phone&lt;/a&gt;, but the range was a lot more limited — roughly 130-195mm-equivalent. This Oppo module starts at 85mm, a common focal length for portrait headshots, which should make it a lot more versatile. Oppo points out that using one camera across more focal lengths ensures more consistent performance in terms of color and white balance, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFgrzy"&gt;Unfortunately, Oppo isn’t saying when it might ship this camera on a commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iz6fs-jJ9tMine1rDM_KXWE74-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792004/OPPO_s_Five_axis_OIS_lens_shift.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Agmo"&gt;The next announcement is a five-axis optical image stabilization system that makes use of both lens-shift and sensor-shift techniques as well as movement data from the phone’s gyroscope. Lens shifting is used for more gradual stabilization, while sensor shift is applied in more dramatic situations, and includes the ability to roll the sensor as well as along the X and Y axes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKRKd"&gt;Oppo says this allows for three times better stabilization than you can achieve with regular OIS camera modules, which is also what Vivo says about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326786/vivo-x50-pro-plus-gimbal-camera-global-india-release-price"&gt;gimbal-style systems it’s been shipping since last year&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the zoom lens, though, Oppo is confirming a release timeframe for the OIS system — it’ll start appearing in Oppo phones in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fBwdFXdBMyMtwUj9nDFKlbQmzSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792003/Illustration_of_OPPO_s_next_generation_RGBW_Sensor_pixels.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WBVnIM"&gt;Oppo’s last major announcement is a new image sensor that uses an RGBW sub-pixel layout, adding extra white subpixels for what the company claims is a 60-percent increase in light sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV5Kcx"&gt;Oppo acknowledges that earlier attempts at RGBW sensors had their limitations, but it thinks the new effort should make a big difference due to more advanced manufacturing processes and improved demosaicing algorithms. It’ll be available pretty soon, too — the company says it’ll appear in phones shipping in Q4 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUwmt6PC9yCHDThvasRp_NBDs7Q=/0x70:1252x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68904498/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3ofto"&gt;There’s nothing like an explosion of blockchain news to leave you thinking, “Um… what’s going on here?” That’s the feeling I’ve experienced while reading about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;Grimes getting millions of dollars for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat being sold as one&lt;/a&gt;. And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet&lt;/a&gt; up for sale as an NFT. Now, months after we first published this explainer, we’re still seeing headlines about people paying &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-are-shelling-out-six-figures-for-nft-rocks-1847508926"&gt;house-money for clip art of rocks&lt;/a&gt; — and my mom still doesn’t really understand what an NFT is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZyml"&gt;You might be wondering: what is an NFT, anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4l9b"&gt;After literal hours of reading, I think I know. I also think I’m going to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vM2Wj0"&gt;Okay, let’s start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y3hj8i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an NFT? What does NFT stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XAkRR1"&gt;Non-fungible token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lwjaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That doesn’t make it any clearer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBCh6D"&gt;Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which &lt;em&gt;StadiumTalk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-expensive-baseball-cards-985687df1bbe45c5"&gt;calls “the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.&lt;/a&gt;” (I’ll take their word for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HudKGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do NFTs work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbvoGM"&gt;At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs. (&lt;a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/tron-introduces-nft-standard-trc-721"&gt;Some already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifr4y9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHk7K"&gt;NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAcH3qsbkwApyVu4-Zl-AJ1hXFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341197/doge.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x3b3ee1931dc30c1957379fac9aba94d1c48a5405/576" target="_blank"&gt;NyanCat on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin isn’t an NFT. But this GIF of a dogecoin is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0IlP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean, like, people buying my good tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V58lf"&gt;I don’t think anyone can stop you, but that’s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/nfts-guide-nonfungible-tokens-cryptomedia-trend-ownership-internet/"&gt;an evolution of fine art collecting&lt;/a&gt;, only with digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLI5c1"&gt;(Side note, when coming up with the line “buying my good tweets,” we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn’t be a real thing. So &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter sold one for just under $3 million&lt;/a&gt; shortly after we posted the article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaSIX4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do people really think this will become like art collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig7cLB"&gt;I’m sure some people really hope so — like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;50-second video by Grimes&lt;/a&gt; or the person who paid $6.6 million for &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001"&gt;a video by Beeple&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, one of Beeple’s pieces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;was auctioned at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;, the famou—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3dcQxqw8oMubtaqyVI6ZzIM37o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341206/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.31.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoink!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i77Dld"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, I was busy right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid millions of dollars for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNNHsj"&gt;Wow, rude. But yeah, that’s where it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/"&gt;gets a bit awkward&lt;/a&gt;. You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmQtyf"&gt;But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWoqGE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No shade to Beeple, but the video isn’t really a Monet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBUNfq"&gt;What do you think of &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x4140783cc1ba30653a0777126b122931e233ba14/1300010027"&gt;the $3,600 Gucci Ghost&lt;/a&gt;? Also, you didn’t let me finish earlier. That image that Beeple was auctioning off at Christie’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;ended up selling for $69 million&lt;/a&gt;, which, by the way, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html"&gt;is $15 million more than Monet’s painting &lt;em&gt;Nymphéas&lt;/em&gt; sold for&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeTKAEvLmop3TJky4G1whbuRXB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341209/GucciGhost.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Trevor Andrew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This last sold for $3,600, but the current owner is asking for $16,300.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGn9Ci"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoever got that Monet can actually appreciate it as a physical object. With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WyUKa"&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;flex &lt;/em&gt;of owning an original Beeple...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G89vD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think I remember hearing that NFTs &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://protos.com/nft-market-bubble-popped-crypto-collectibles-are-over/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are already over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Didn’t the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://qz.com/2016058/the-nft-boom-is-over-for-now/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;boom go bust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m35F3s"&gt;But surely you’ve heard of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html"&gt;penguin communities&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyZpi7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P...Penguin communities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YE7wyz"&gt;Right, so... people have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Owners_Group"&gt;long built communities based on things they own&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s happening with NFTs. One community that’s been &lt;a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/pudgy-penguins-pump-dump-or-nft-mainstay/"&gt;exceedingly popular&lt;/a&gt; revolves around a collection of NFTs called Pudgy Penguins, but it’s not the only community built up around the tokens. It could be argued that one of the earliest NFT projects, CryptoPunks, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/"&gt;has a community around it&lt;/a&gt;, and there are other animal-themed projects like &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-bored-ape-avatars-are-taking-over-twitter"&gt;the Bored Ape Yacht Club&lt;/a&gt; that have their own clique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juDtL1"&gt;Of course, the communal activities depend on the community. For Pudgy Penguin or Bored Ape owners, it seems to involve &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/penguin-nft-club.html"&gt;vibing and sharing memes on Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or complimenting each other on their Pudgy Penguin Twitter avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJgEli"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the point of NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6d92bZ"&gt;That really depends on whether you’re an artist or a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt7KYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an artist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ1eqE"&gt;First off: I’m proud of you. Way to go. You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. If you come up with a really cool digital sticker idea, what are you going to do? Sell it on the iMessage App Store? No way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIsq2g"&gt;Also, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the NFT is sold or changes hands&lt;/a&gt;, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you’ll see some of that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7oBax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a buyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwjNxk"&gt;One of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support artists you like, and that’s true with NFTs (which are way trendier than, like, Telegram stickers). Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWIC6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I meant I’m a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYjdCo"&gt;Ah, okay, yes. NFTs can work &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;like any other speculative asset&lt;/a&gt;, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking about that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuKmlZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So every NFT is unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91YTgt"&gt;In the boring, technical sense that every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there’s only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there’s 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09JRP3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQVHLe"&gt;Well, that’s part of what makes NFTs so messy. Some people treat them like they’re the future of fine art collecting (read: as a playground for the mega-rich), and some people treat them like Pokémon cards (where they’re accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich). Speaking of Pokémon cards, Logan Paul just sold some NFTs relating to a million-dollar box of the—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1JJGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please stop. I hate where this is going.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laUmvyGGiD-HsDas7TBDZall_n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341219/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.39.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Logan Paul&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve activated my trap card (which sold for $17,000).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv0A8X"&gt;Yeah, he sold NFT video clips, which are just clips from a video you can watch on YouTube anytime you want, &lt;a href="https://shopnfts.net/"&gt;for up to $20,000&lt;/a&gt;. He also sold NFTs of a Logan Paul Pokémon card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh63Tc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who paid $20,000 for a video clip of Logan Paul?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWkQs7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Calvinn_Hobbes/status/746227239755251712?s=20"&gt;A fool and their money are soon parted&lt;/a&gt;, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZNFb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be hilarious if Logan Paul decided to sell 50 more NFTs of the exact same video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXPBux"&gt;Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda (who also sold some NFTs that included a song) &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview"&gt;actually talked about that&lt;/a&gt;. It’s totally a thing someone could do if they were, in his words, “an opportunist crooked jerk.” I’m not saying that Logan Paul is that, just that you should be careful who you buy from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdZoRB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are NFTs mainstream now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljp9xY"&gt;It depends on what you mean. If you’re asking if, say, my mom owns one, the answer is no. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6FeSYBN-r4HxZKK76nQF3XUayfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791317/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_3.38.15_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The response from my mom when I asked her about owning NFTs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r3Mo40"&gt;But we have seen big brands and celebrities like &lt;a href="https://beincrypto.com/marvel-launches-marvel-mightys-nft-collection/"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.si.com/hockey/news/wayne-gretzky-launches-new-nft-collectibles"&gt;Wayne Gretzky&lt;/a&gt; launch their own NFTs, which seem to be aimed at more traditional collectors, rather than crypto-enthusiasts. While I don’t think I’d call NFTs “mainstream” in the way that smartphones are mainstream, or &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is mainstream, they do seem to have, at least to some extent, shown some staying power even outside of the cryptosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWxHZd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what do The Youth think of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BBlZ3"&gt;Ah yes, excellent question. We here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have an interest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587391/next-gen-technology-youth-teen-culture"&gt;what the next generation is doing&lt;/a&gt;, and it certainly does seem like some of them have been experimenting with NFTs. An 18 year-old who goes by the name FEWOCiOUS says that his NFT drops have &lt;a href="https://fewocious.com/about/"&gt;netted over $17 million&lt;/a&gt; — though obviously most haven’t had the same success. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/14/style/teens-nft-art.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;talked to a few teens&lt;/a&gt; in the NFC space, and some said they used NFTs as a way to get used to working on a project with a team, or to just earn some spending money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="611ErY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I buy this article as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw2A6d"&gt;No, but technically anything digital could be sold as an NFT (including articles from &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1984094/quartz-is-selling-the-first-ever-nft-news-article/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provided you have anywhere from $1,800 to $560,000). deadmau5 has sold digital animated stickers. William Shatner has sold &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/william-shatners-nft-collectibles-sell-out-at-warp-speed"&gt;Shatner-themed trading cards&lt;/a&gt; (one of which was apparently an X-ray of his teeth).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one I like. Maybe not for $700, but...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0DpEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross. Actually, could I buy someone’s teeth as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y73FL"&gt;There have been some attempts at connecting NFTs to real-world objects, often as a sort of verification method. Nike has patented a method to &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/10/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent/"&gt;verify sneakers’ authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, I haven’t found any teeth, no. I’m scared to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUxvr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look? Where? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEbiIN"&gt;There are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. These include OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes’ choice, Nifty Gateway, but there are plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwUvnp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard there were kittens involved. Tell me about the kittens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zszcnd"&gt;NFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/"&gt;as part of a new standard&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, one of the first uses was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties"&gt;a game called CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt; that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. Thank you, internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkghYZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love kittens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMnW6"&gt;Not as much as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;the person who paid over $170,000 for one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uedrnj7kfMuTOKIghiRp4yUtLOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341171/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My face when I’m worth $170K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFaF1c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrrrrggggg!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD0ynI"&gt;Same. But in my opinion, the kittens show that one of the most interesting aspects of NFTs (for those of us not looking to create a digital dragon’s lair of art) is how they can be used in games. There are &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/"&gt;already games&lt;/a&gt; that let you have NFTs as items. One even sells virtual plots of land as NFTs. There could be opportunities for players to buy a unique in-game gun or helmet or whatever as an NFT, which would be a flex that most people could actually appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hsXGo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least it’s not digital pet rocks... right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk4a1a"&gt;In fact, there are people who are spending tens or &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6610bb0f50a4524aa3381fb186178fdf4e0e5a1fc9ec5172d78e8c53bed9fa04"&gt;hundreds of thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-are-shelling-out-six-figures-for-nft-rocks-1847508926"&gt;NFT pet rocks&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="https://etherrock.com"&gt;website for which&lt;/a&gt; says that the rocks serve no purpose other than being tradable and limited).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YPXoA7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I cry on your shoulder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i2XTX"&gt;Only if I can cry on yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFnEOt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could I pull off a museum heist to steal NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wuFlpK8EGVxFIUYTKb0hFd3pBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341161/robbery.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image is not an NFT. Yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBINrG"&gt;That depends. Part of the allure of blockchain is that it stores a record of each time a transaction takes place, making it harder to steal and flip than, say, a painting hanging in a museum. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49177705"&gt;cryptocurrencies have been stolen before&lt;/a&gt;, so it really would depend on how the NFT is being stored and how much work a potential victim would be willing to put in to get their stuff back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAPTND"&gt;Note: Please don’t steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnhPUz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I be worried about digital art being around in 500 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIQPdV"&gt;Probably. Bit rot is a real thing: image quality deteriorates, file formats can’t be opened anymore, websites go down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;people forget the password to their wallets&lt;/a&gt;. But physical art in museums is also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETAcIbzOTYs"&gt;shockingly fragile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6zH8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to maximize my blockchain use. Can I buy NFTs with cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU56ST"&gt;Yes. Probably. A lot of the marketplaces accept Ethereum. But technically, anyone can sell an NFT, and they could ask for whatever currency they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZmGbU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will trading my Logan Paul NFTs contribute to global warming and melt Greenland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOtuLt"&gt;It’s definitely something to look out for. Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as some energy-hungry cryptocurrencies, they also end up using a lot of electricity. There are people working &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent"&gt;on mitigating this issue&lt;/a&gt;, but so far, most NFTs are still tied to cryptocurrencies that generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. There have been a few cases where artists have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacksfilms/status/1369070588136845313?s=20"&gt;decided to not sell&lt;/a&gt; NFTs or to cancel future drops &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/"&gt;after hearing about the effects they could have on climate change&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, one of my colleagues has really dug into it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;so you can read this piece to get a fuller picture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xy7W81"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The NFT market has grown,&lt;br&gt;As eight-figure auctions have shown.&lt;br&gt;The overall price is&lt;br&gt;A worse climate crisis&lt;br&gt;For art you pretend that you own.&lt;/p&gt;— Limericking (@Limericking) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Limericking/status/1371534624866844673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="23nZ0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I build an underground art cave / bunker to store my NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ69E"&gt;Well, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets (though it is worth noting that the wallet does specifically have to be NFT-compatible). You could always put the wallet on a computer in an underground bunker, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9tfJn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I wanted to watch a TV show that’s somehow related to NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbv9s7"&gt;Believe it or not, you have options! Steve Aoki &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/steve-aoki-has-secured-funding-to-pilot-his-nft-tv-show"&gt;is working on a show&lt;/a&gt; based on a character from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322218/john-legere-buys-steve-aoki-nft"&gt;a previous NFT drop&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;Dominion X&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://dominionxshow.com"&gt;show’s site&lt;/a&gt; says that it’ll be an episodic series launched on the blockchain (the first short video is &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x01Ba93514e5Eb642Ec63E95EF7787b0eDd403ADd/1"&gt;on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;), and there are hundreds of NFTs already associated with the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBwHc0"&gt;There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/vitalik-buterin-joins-cast-of-stoner-cats-mila-kunis-new-animated-nft-show"&gt;a show called &lt;em&gt;Stoner Cats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (yes, it’s about cats that get high, and yes it stars Mila Kunis, Chris Rock, and Jane Fonda), which uses NFTs as a sort of ticket system. Currently, there’s only one episode available, but a &lt;em&gt;Stoner Cat&lt;/em&gt; NFT (which, of course, is called a TOKEn) is required to watch it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTjAxP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you tired of typing “NFT”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNFTvl"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8lOzHF"&gt;
&lt;p id="RM05sp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 8:07PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added the news that Jack Dorsey was selling one of his tweets as an NFT because I originally made a joke and cannot believe it actually happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEpRTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 11th, 1:42PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added the news that Beeple’s piece sold for $69 million and added more information to the climate change section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaJIGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 15th, 1:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a link to our piece on the environmental impact of NFTs and updated some of the language to reflect some recent research. Also added a poem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOkS8P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 25th, 3:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added note about &lt;/em&gt;Quartz&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;NYT&lt;em&gt; selling articles as NFTs because once again it’s something that I made a joke about and then actually happened. Also updated the part about Jack Dorsey selling his tweet with the final price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIFZYQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 18th, 9:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added new questions and answers that have cropped up over the course of 2021, like “are NFTs dead,” “are there NFT-based TV shows,” and “are there clipart images of rocks being sold as NFTs?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feiyu one-ups DJI by letting you stick its tiny self-balancing camera to anything you like</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dxc-ceH8hlz2HYTei0TZX0TFFCU=/0x0:1391x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69745436/feiyu_pocket_2s_main.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QAW9i5"&gt;Half a decade ago, dronemaker DJI realized its miniature aerial steadicams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9695822/dji-osmo-camera-gimbal-stabilizer-price-specs-review"&gt;might be handy to carry around on foot&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s not the only company monopolizing on the shrinking tech. Rival FeiyuTech now has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524505/dji-osmo-pocket-2-price-release-date-features-4k-video-gimbal"&gt;DJI Pocket&lt;/a&gt; competitor that ups the ante by letting you detach the entire motorized gimbal, so you can stick a lightweight self-balancing camera to your car, helmet, wrist, or any magnetic surface up to three feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfL13p"&gt;It’s called the &lt;a href="https://www.feiyu-tech.com/feiyu-pocket-2s/"&gt;FeiyuTech Pocket 2S&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Ffeiyu-pocket-2s-the-ultimate-3-axis-gimbal-camera%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22631560%2Ffeiyutech-pocket-2s-detachable-gimbal-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on crowdfunding site Indiegogo right now&lt;/a&gt; for $399, or a little less if you take advantage of its early bird discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x1uRac"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibYcACev79Y?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQw43d"&gt;According to the company, the camera shoots up to 4K footage at 60 fps with a Sony IMX 317 sensor, and can do up to 3 hours of continuous recording at 1080p. While you only get a square video preview on the handle, you can sling a full view to a phone, and there’s a Micro HDMI port to plug into a monitor or TV. Charging and data transfer happens over USB-C, and there’s a built-in 1/4-inch tripod socket. Footage is stored on a UHS-1 microSD card, up to 512GB. &lt;a href="https://www.feiyu-tech.com/feiyu-pocket-2s/specs.html"&gt;More specs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="gcuRUo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7u8Nsk"&gt;Judging by some of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22feiyu+pocket+2s%22"&gt;the early reviews on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, image quality may leave something to be desired, particularly when it comes to crispness and dynamic range. I wouldn’t expect Feiyu or DJI to stop selling their larger motorized gimbals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401564/dji-osmo-mobile-4-phone-gimbal-magnetic-announce-price-release-date"&gt;for phones&lt;/a&gt;, mirrorless cameras and DSLRs anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OCjTQ"&gt;But it’s pretty slick to be able to just throw one of these detachable cameras atop a mount like a GoPro, or slap one atop a ferrous metal surface and instantly get stabilized footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dK5pfj"&gt;It’s a great way for these camera companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;compete with GoPro&lt;/a&gt;, for that matter, whose in-camera stabilization has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features"&gt;dramatically improving&lt;/a&gt; the last few years. And without any obvious tradeoffs beyond a visible coiled cable, I wouldn’t be surprised if DJI and others follow Feiyu’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;
