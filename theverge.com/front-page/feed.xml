    <title>Dune puts an epic franchise ahead of its epic story</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation wows with scale and scope but is missing an ending&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fN16Un"&gt;The most important thing to know about the movie called &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s not actually “Dune.” As the title card relates from the first seconds of the movie, the film you’re watching (which debuts on HBO Max on October 21st at 6PM ET and in theaters on October 22nd) isn’t &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, but rather &lt;em&gt;Dune: Part One&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a movie that aspires from the start to be more than a single film. It’s the start of a capital F-&lt;em&gt;Franchise&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v95g3v"&gt;To be clear, the movie that director Denis Villeneuve has here is great. &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; actually succeeds at translating the oftentimes impenetrable novel into an enjoyable and approachable sci-fi epic at a scale far beyond the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Treks&lt;/em&gt; of yore. The problem is that it feels more like half of an epic. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8L2-HZWV_vD5xfZDWrK5Hgshg3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943079/rev_1_DUN_T2_0039_High_Res_JPEG__1_.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9zRqP6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; (the movie) is based on &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, the classic sci-fi novel from author Frank Herbert. At its core, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Paul Atreides, the son and heir to House Atreides, which is engaged in a complex political power struggle with another house, the villainous Harkonnens. Specifically, everyone is fighting over control of the desert planet Arrakis — the titular “dune” — and the source of the incredibly valuable resource spice, which enables all galactic commerce and travel. Along the way, Paul also stumbles into a greater destiny that could change the face of the galaxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYzzHe"&gt;A key part of its success is lead actor Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides, who has to walk the line between coming across as an actual human being with feelings and emotions and the otherworldly, wise-beyond-his-years messiah that Paul is destined to become. Chalamet’s Paul doesn’t want to be the next Duke of House Atreides; he wants to hang out with Jason Momoa’s bro-y Duncan Idaho, skip his classes because he’s not in the mood, and complain about having to attend family functions. It helps to humanize Paul, who otherwise comes across as a know-it-all who gets to be the best at all of Dune’s various quasi-magic techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="twRjO5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; actually succeeds at translating the oftentimes impenetrable novel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TyVFHF"&gt;The rest of the incredibly star-filled cast is great, too, although many A-list actors feel underused in a way that practically screams “they’ll be back in the sequels!” Oscar Isaac gets the most screentime of the relatively minor characters and puts it to good use as the noble, patrician Duke Leto. Isaac exudes a sense of righteous honor, and it’s easy to see both why his men would follow him to a forsaken desert world and why he falls so thoroughly into the political traps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B57zM"&gt;Momoa brings the most levity to the occasionally ponderous film, sauntering from scene to scene with smiles and swagger. But other characters — like Javier Bardem’s Freman leader, Josh Brolin’s surly weapons master, or Dave Bautista’s villainous Rabban — feel more like table setting for the sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPnsRk"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; — at least for this first half — gives less attention to its female leads. Zendaya’s Chani, destined to be Paul’s love interest and partner in the latter half of Herbert’s novel, is relegated to silent, softly lit perfume commercial-style visions for the vast majority of the film. Rebecca Ferguson gets a little more to do as the Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother, but she spends a lot more time in the film worrying over her son and partner than she does as a member of the politically powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wECDDfeJyryHzthq1VL0YhilW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943085/rev_1_DUN_T2_0040r_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vCeRM6"&gt;Women hold positions of power in &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s world, but in &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; the film, they’re largely second to the male leads. That will presumably change if (or when) Villeneuve gets to adapt the second half of the book, which sees Jessica and Chani take larger roles in the story during Paul’s time among the Freman, but right now, it’s more setup than payoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZOEez"&gt;The main exception is Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet-Kynes, a gender-swapped version of the book character who is both an Imperial liaison caught between her love of Arrakis and the Freman and her allegiance to the Emperor, who seeks to embroil Kynes in his plots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FMcLs"&gt;The real star of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, though, is the setting and worldbuilding. All of Villeneuve’s modes from previous films like &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; are turned up to 11 here: the ships are starker and more abstract, the buildings more towering and brutalist, the landscapes are more sweeping and desolate, the bass-heavy score from Hans Zimmer even more thunderous. I’m still not sure I buy the argument that Dune (or any film, really) &lt;em&gt;demands&lt;/em&gt; to be seen in a proper theater, but you’ll definitely want to make sure you’ve got a good set of speakers handy for however you do watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PG6mJYg_KsjrYqecY1A9UzN8pIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943090/rev_1_DU_21469_Sr_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K03xST"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is a film designed to be seen as epic, with a scope and scale that extends from everything from Paul’s weighty destiny to the sheer size of the iconic sandworms. And it works: when everything is firing on all cylinders, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; overwhelms with visual, thematic, and sonic heft without losing sight of the personal dramas that power those lofty ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1oqo86"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The real star of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, though, is the setting and worldbuilding&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oh0NWt"&gt;Fortunately, Villeneuve wisely skips over a lot of Herbert’s info-dumps and makes some of the more subtle political machinations a little clearer in an effort to streamline and simplify the story. No one in the film says the word “mentat” or explains the concept of the living calculators, for example, but no one really needs to. The result is a film that’s relatively approachable for a &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; adaptation, even for newcomers to the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eebQaj"&gt;But the biggest problem with &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is that it ends just as the movie is getting started, cutting off not with a big, cathartic ending but somewhere in the middle of the second act of the story. &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; leaves you wanting more, but in the sense that you didn’t actually get everything you were promised. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGW5uaGnY5lXALFx9zeYm6HmcdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943087/rev_1_DU_10745rv4_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6ebkjM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; does try to have its cake and eat it, too, in some respects, with Paul’s visions of possible futures filling in for epic Freman battles and &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s galactic stakes. It even tosses a quick shot of someone finally riding a sandworm in the final moments, as if to remind viewers (and studio executives) that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; fun is coming in the still unconfirmed sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn49jl"&gt;If there is a Dune: Part Two somewhere down the line, there’s going to be the possibility of an hours-long marathon of the two parts of the movie for an experience that rivals the original tome. But for now, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s methodological worldbuilding and table setting is in the same place the movie leaves Paul: primed for greatness, but with a lot of unrealized potential that has yet to be unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thrustmaster’s T248 is a great PS5 racing wheel</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Get ready for Gran Turismo 7&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="VudFdO"&gt;Thrustmaster’s new $399.99 T248 is a force-feedback steering wheel and pedal setup designed for the PS5, PS4, and PC. While it’s not quite as premium as some of the more extreme enthusiast gear out there, it’s intended to be an all-in-one package that gets players started with a good quality racing wheel setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiR7QG"&gt;I’ve been using it for a while in advance of its release today, and I think Thrustmaster has struck an impressive balance between price and performance. If you can fit it into your setup, it’s a great option for PlayStation and PC. (An Xbox-compatible version will also follow later this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dI37ND"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10817247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5DNs7U"&gt;If you’ve never used a force feedback wheel before, it’s hard to overstate how much one can change the experience of playing racing games. A good wheel provides a strong level of resistance and can replicate the effects of the track on your vehicle in granular detail, which heightens both immersion and your understanding of what’s going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE3aPR"&gt;The most dedicated racing simulator fans use direct-drive wheels, which are essentially full-on car wheels attached directly to bulky motors and usually cost thousands of dollars. Entry-level wheels, meanwhile, rely on more conventional gears and rumble motors. Thrustmaster’s “Hybrid Drive” system sits somewhere between the two, using belts and pulleys to provide force feedback; the company says the T248 is the only wheel in its price range to use a belt in its design like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLCtLn"&gt;The T248 also stands apart by integrating an LCD screen into the wheel itself. Depending on the game, this can display information like lap info, speed, your position, and more, or device-specific settings such as the type of force feedback and the angle of the wheel. It’s not something I found myself spending a lot of time looking at — it is generally a bad idea to look away from the actual screen when you’re playing a racing game — but it does add a nice touch of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYYdQX"&gt;The T248 is easy enough to hook up to your PlayStation or PC. It does require an external power supply, but otherwise it’s simply a matter of connecting the pedals to the wheel and then a single USB cable to your gaming machine. (You do need to download a driver on PC.) It has all the buttons you’d expect on a PS5 controller, so you can navigate menus and so on with ease. One thing to watch for is that it’ll calibrate itself by quickly spinning the wheel back and forth when you turn your hardware on, which could be alarming if you’re not expecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDg7O4NffRZm-d1X7LharV0V_Dw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941549/DSCF7781.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUwkwf"&gt;Another thing you might not expect is the potential difficulty of actually getting all the equipment in place. The wheel comes with a clamp system that is relatively easy to attach to a desk or table, but you’re likely to find that your existing furniture isn’t at the ideal height or placement for a comfortable position. In my living room, for example, I have a coffee table pulled close to the sofa, so if I make room for the pedals I have to push the table back and hunch over the wheel to reach it. The setup worked better in my office with my PC as I could just put the pedals under the desk, but that made me wish for wheel locks on my chair because slamming the brakes sometimes ended up pushing me backward across the hard floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zxeGV"&gt;None of this is news to racing game enthusiasts, of course, which is why they often go for more elaborate setups involving screwing the wheels and pedals into a dedicated cockpit-style frame. These can be relatively accessible and inexpensive, but obviously it’s more of a space commitment than attaching a wheel to an existing desk. As the T248 is a product intended to give first-time users a good out-of-the-box experience, it’s worth noting that you may need to make a few more adjustments yourself than what Thrustmaster is able to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNnXgk"&gt;Once you’re set up and comfortable, though, the T248 is great. I played it with a wide variety of racing games, from arcade-y titles like &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;, to more realistic releases like &lt;em&gt;F1 2020&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Assetto Corsa&lt;/em&gt;, and it makes each and every one of them feel like completely different games compared to the experience you get with a regular controller. You have a much better sense of when your car might slip out of control or when you ought to start accelerating out of a corner. Even a comparatively niche game like &lt;em&gt;MudRunner —&lt;/em&gt; which involves plowing heavy Soviet vehicles through challenging off-road environments — is transformed into a fight against the machinery and the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYpdLk"&gt;While you’re not going to get the level of feedback of an expensive direct-drive setup, this is far more convincing and realistic than the lower-end wheels I’ve used. It also just feels more premium, with a leathery finish over foam surrounding the wheel itself. There isn’t a gear stick included, but the magnetic shifter paddles behind the wheel are satisfyingly clicky. The pedals also feel very substantial, including one for the clutch as well as the accelerator and brake, and you can adjust their level of resistance by swapping out the springs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ooxje05-sO-7cuPhwRZ0FRQ_pIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941550/DSCF7778.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n9dZ2j"&gt;You don’t strictly need a racing wheel to play racing games, just as you don’t need a flight stick for flight simulators or a fighting stick for fighters. But as with those genres, a dedicated controller should be considered essential for budding enthusiasts. If you’re a beginner who’s serious about the idea — or just really hyped for &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 —&lt;/em&gt; the T248 is a great way to get started. For a game controller, $399 isn’t exactly impulse-buy territory, but I think you get good value for what this package is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JedOCQ"&gt;The one thing to know is that it does require a slight commitment. You’ll either want to be sure it can work in your living environment already or prepare to construct a full-on driving rig in your basement. The T248 has spent most of its time attached to the desk in my office, and it’s been a blast. But if I had the space for a frame, well, that would be a whole new rabbit hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkxLdu"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PlayStation- and PC-compatible Thrustmaster T248 is available today. An Xbox- and PC-compatible version will follow this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raspberry Pi temporarily increases Pi 4 price in response to chip shortages </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuLcX0x-d7ugcyloSbJ1WIs0mE4=/0x2:1200x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70024810/EZFf0mwWAAEfTyI.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Raspberry Pi 4.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Raspberry Pi Foundation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5DECKM"&gt;In response to supply chain issues, particularly around semiconductors, Raspberry Pi is increasing the price of the version of the Raspberry Pi 4 sold with 2GB of RAM. The increase, which &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-shortages-and-our-first-ever-price-increase/"&gt;CEO Eben Upton says&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s first ever, will see the Pi 4 2GB’s price rise by $10 from $35 to $45. To serve the needs of customers on tighter budgets, the company is reintroducing the 1GB Pi 4 for $35, which was discontinued last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zppraf"&gt;“These changes in pricing are not here to stay,” Upton writes. “As global supply chain issues moderate, we’ll keep revisiting this issue, and we want to get pricing back to where it was as fast as we can.” Upton said supply chain challenges are likely to continue through next year, echoing the predictions of larger companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;TSMC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358256/apple-supplier-foxconn-parts-shortages-chips-2022"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;, but added that the company sees “early signs that the supply chain situation is starting to ease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1U00or"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to get pricing back to where it was as fast as we can”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HO7Wb"&gt;It’s a significant price increase of over 25 percent for the 2GB Pi 4, a computer prized for its affordability, that could have a big impact on the industrial customers that use Raspberry Pis. Upton says that although the world appears to be slowly emerging from the pandemic, semiconductors continue to be in high demand thanks to companies panic buying components to ensure they have enough to meet their own demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cW7rcZ"&gt;The changes effectively revert the price drop Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-price-raspberry-pi-4-2gb/"&gt;introduced in February last year&lt;/a&gt; in response to falling RAM prices. It came just weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic began to upend demand for, and the supply of, consumer technology. Since then everyone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;games console and graphics card manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;automakers&lt;/a&gt; has had to grapple with shortages of key components, limiting their ability to produce enough products to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvfMoh"&gt;Raspberry Pi adds that it’s deprioritizing production of the the Raspberry Pi 3B Plus, and is advising customers who rely on this model to migrate to the 1GB Pi 4 if they want to ensure uninterrupted availability. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where is Google’s foldable phone? Everything we know so far </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HTInjXG9qVRU8taeyzbIVu5_ZnQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70024755/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaks indicate the Pixel Fold may resemble the  Samsung Galaxy Z Flip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRr0gg"&gt;During the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;“Pixel Fall Launch” event&lt;/a&gt;, Google formally launched the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro as well as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22725981/google-pixel-pass-subscription-services-phone-monthly-payments-price"&gt;Pixel Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, however, the tech giant didn’t divulge much more about other new products — like Google’s first folding phone. Google &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-is-already-working-on-a-foldable-pixel-phone/"&gt;previously confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 it’s working on prototyping foldable device technology, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;applied for patents&lt;/a&gt; on foldable screens, and we’ve since reported on a number of leaks suggesting the Pixel Fold might arrive as soon as this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ceYdn"&gt;For example, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested Samsung was going to produce folding OLED panels for the device this very month — and that’s just one of many recent leaks. Here’s a catch-up on everything else we think we know about the Pixel Fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RuV9Ed"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have big screens, big ambitions, and small prices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"},{"title":"Spec showdown: Google’s new Pixel 6 vs. Samsung, Apple, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735208/google-pixel-6-pro-spec-comparison-iphone-samsung-oneplus-camera-battery-screen-size"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="VcgcYY"&gt;The Pixel Fold was rumored to launch by the end of 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="gRtTh2"&gt;Internal documents from 2020 suggest a “Passport,” a name used internally for one of the Pixel Fold designs, would launch during the fourth quarter of 2021. That’s a prediction that was repeated by &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;TheElec&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2021, as well as reliable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1439827216343474176"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; in September. That’s why some predicted Google would show off the Pixel Fold during the “Pixel Fall Launch” event, which obviously it didn’t. Of course, we still have a little over two months left of 2021, so there’s still a possibility of seeing it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qnuAvp9VAnbHVF1G90L5WIMmyVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942258/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_9.22.36_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Patentscope&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagram from Google’s 2019 patent application filing was one of the earliest reports suggesting it’s experimenting with foldable device tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="CuJyk0"&gt;Google apparently has two potential foldable designs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="IO8QoX"&gt;The public first found out about &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/08/05/google-pixel-foldable-leaked-document/"&gt;the “Passport” codename&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020 after leaked internal documents referred to the device accordingly. That was the only Pixel Fold we’d heard of for over a year, and the one that would supposedly launch in 2021. In September 2021, however, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/18/pixel-fold-jumbojack-android-12-1/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s sources&lt;/a&gt; reported Google is also testing a second foldable Pixel smartphone dubbed “Jumbojack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmvFFu"&gt;We don’t know when this second device will be released, if ever. In fact, we don’t know whether the “Jumboback” is a second type of Pixel foldable device, or an internal prototype Google is using to build out foldable phone features. What we do know, however, is that both seem different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EeGmOV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 review: flipping into the mainstream","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"},{"title":"Samsung will now let you design your own Galaxy Z Flip 3","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22735494/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-bespoke-edition-design-unpacked-2"},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="2j409L"&gt;One folds more like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip, the other like the Z Fold&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ofphy"&gt;There’s some speculation the “Jumboback” codename name is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/18/pixel-fold-jumbojack-android-12-1/"&gt;a reference&lt;/a&gt; to Jack in the Box’s Jumbo Jack cheeseburger. This implies the phone may fold “hamburger style” like a powder case, as Samsung’s Z Flip does. That differs from the Passport’s alleged “hotdog” style, which folds like a passport similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C60diawaxiEDjuAJT9ecTK_eubM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942230/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_9.15.48_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Jumboback” may fold in this Samsung Z Flip’s “hamburger” style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x8h412"&gt;Interestingly, the “Passport” design’s folding display might even have the same screen size as Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3. A June 2021 report from &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates the phone could come with a 7.6-inch folding display panel that folds inward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVp6H0sYuZFLx34hLpwM1Vyynb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801025/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Passport” design, meanwhile, may fold like the Samsung Z Fold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QsOX57"&gt;Samsung could produce its OLED panels and may own a part of the Fold’s screen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="B6S9IJ"&gt;That same report from &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also suggests Samsung would start producing folding OLED panels in October for the “Passport” device. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;may also&lt;/a&gt; use Samsung’s proprietary ultra-thin cover glass, which is bendable (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;and is technically produced by Schott&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18071720/google-android-foldables-fragmentation-displays"&gt;Samsung worked closely with Google&lt;/a&gt; to support foldable screens in Android to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="r7L7xS"&gt;The Fold may come with a new foldable-friendly version of Android — might that delay its launch date?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="KA6bn7"&gt;In September 2021, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/18/pixel-fold-jumbojack-android-12-1/"&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/a&gt; sources revealed the Jumbojack foldable device due to references in a future version of the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says could be Android 12.1. Incidentally, Android 12.1 is an update that may also offer several foldable-focused improvements, an analysis of leaked code by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaaHhG"&gt;According to the publication, these Android 12.1 enhancements include a better split-screen UI and a new taskbar to easily access and use multiple apps using both screens simultaneously. The lock screen could also make better use of horizontal space, showing, for example, notifications on one side and the clock on the other, while placing Quick Settings and notifications panels side-by-side. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8pOA7CobN5Kt2tkQIjgSrHw6jQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899747/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 launched on October 19th and offers more design customization options. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zo7OyB"&gt;Will the Pixel Fold, or at least the Jumboback, need to wait to launch until Android 12.1 is ready. Is that why we have yet to see the Pixel Fold? Android 12 only just released, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You can stream Dune a day early on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HytV6ML1MK74NEgD8s12_9HD9xU=/213x0:899x457/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023748/Screen_Shot_2020_09_09_at_4.21.36_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wqpttn"&gt;After numerous delays — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;considerable vitriol&lt;/a&gt; from director Denis Villeneuve himself — &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is finally about to stream on HBO Max. In fact, it’s arriving a day early: October 21st at 6PM ET / 3PM PT, a rep confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5hhZv"&gt;Hope you’re hearing soon enough to schedule your watch party! Note that you’ll need to be paying for HBO Max’s $15-a-month ad-free plan, since the $10 plan doesn’t come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;day-and-date Warner Bros. movie releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRUJis"&gt;We’ve had multiple &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; trailers at this point if you want to know what you’re in for, and you can find two of them embedded below. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429525/dune-trailer-reaction-sand-worm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s staff weighed in on the first trailer&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ll have a review soon as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHdsd1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/idLGrJh8ybg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="VgPRw6"&gt;And if you’d rather watch a 4K restoration of the original cult-classic 1984 David Lynch version, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462723/dune-1984-david-lynch-4k-restoration-hdr-dolby-vision-dts-hd"&gt;there’s an upcoming 4K Blu-ray of that&lt;/a&gt; too. (Though it’s now due out December, not August anymore). The new movie’s characters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735293/fortnite-dune-crossover-skins-paul-atreides-timothee-chalamet-zendaya"&gt;have made it into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two SIM swappers phished a phone company so they could steal $16K in crypto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of bitcoin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x8ArCi1dgkIoXbhIAPYa_xD7egk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023632/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cryptocurrency thief pleads guilty in SIM swapping scheme | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zat9vF"&gt;Twenty-year-old Kyell Bryan of Pennsylvania has pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft for a SIM swapping and cryptocurrency theft scheme, according to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/defendant-who-stole-more-16000-cryptocurrency-and-orchestrated-swat-attack-his-accomplice"&gt;the United States Attorney’s Office of the District of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="le7roy"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/two-men-facing-federal-indictment-maryland-scheme-steal-digital-currency-and-social-media"&gt;the initial indictment statement&lt;/a&gt;, in June 2019, Bryan, who was 19, conspired with Jordan K. Milleson, then 21, and others. The group engaged in phishing and vishing (voice phishing) to trick employees at an unnamed wireless operator into coughing up their login credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrxOEv"&gt;As Brian Krebs &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/two-charged-in-sim-swapping-vishing-scams/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; when Bryan and Milleson were indicted, they were active participants of the OGUsers trading forum, which has spawned similar phishing attacks against Twitter and others, usually with the intent of stealing and trading social media handles. Leaked messages from OGUsers reveal that in 2019, Bryan asked another member for help crafting a site that would look like T-Mobile’s employee login page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4qFOba"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter team up to crack down on ‘OGUsers’ hackers who steal rare usernames ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266741/instagram-ogusers-rare-usernames-crackdown-disable-accounts-tiktok-twitter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jOGj5W"&gt;They used those credentials to conduct unauthorized SIM swaps, redirecting their target’s phone number to bypass the two-factor authentication process that is supposed to protect accounts. SIM swapping attacks are why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/15/17695132/att-sued-over-lost-cryptocurrency-sim-swap-theft"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T faced a now-dismissed lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging negligence for failing to stop them in 2018, and the method opened up a way to temporarily hijack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s handle in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvRT3z"&gt;According to the prosecutors, after performing the swap, Bryan instructed Milleson to transfer cryptocurrency valued at $16,847.47 out of the victim’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9LRiW"&gt;The scheming partnership turned into a mission to find Milleson’s true identity when Bryan and other accomplices suspected Milleson cheated them out of their share. After finding out his aliases and personal information from another co-conspirator, Bryan attempted to “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/23/4253014/swatting-911-prank-wont-stop-hackers-celebrities"&gt;swat&lt;/a&gt;” him at his home.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0p9ic"&gt;Bryan called the Baltimore County Police claiming he was at Milleson’s home address with a handgun, saying he’d shot his father and threatening to shoot himself. In the call, he threatened to shoot if confronted by police, attempting to set up the kind of dangerous encounter that has already killed some swatting victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C17vr3"&gt;BCPD didn’t find a gunman at the house, but officers spoke to Milleson’s relative, who told them about a phone call made earlier claiming that Milleson stole $20,000.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SBhMz"&gt;Milleson was sentenced to two years in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $34,329.01 in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AB74o"&gt;Bryan is set to be sentenced in January 2022 and faces two years in federal prison following one year of supervised release. As part of his plea agreement, Bryan will be ordered to pay $16,847.47 in restitution. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch is testing a rewind button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qF422tuEXZXl29Wz3GkPfu3GmJ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023547/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gwKUAg"&gt;One of the appeals of Twitch is watching things unfold live, but I can’t count the number of times I’ve wished I could scrub back to see something again or a moment I might have missed. Soon, though, Twitch may have a solution to that problem, as it’s currently testing a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1450869495392837632"&gt;new Rewind the Stream button&lt;/a&gt; with some users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJGkjJ"&gt;When you hit the button, you’ll be rewinded two minutes back in the stream, Twitch tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. From there, you can scrub through what’s been streamed so far and even watch what you missed at different speeds, like you would with any other Twitch VOD (video on demand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob5HRt"&gt;If you hit the rewind button, you’ll still be able to see what’s happening in the live stream, thanks to a picture-in-picture window that will appear above the chat. However, if a streamer doesn’t have VODs enabled, you won’t be able to use the rewind button. The rewind button test will be expanded to about a quarter of viewers in the coming days, according to Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WJttFC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Over the next month, some viewers may see up to 3 new buttons on live channels pages: Rewind the Stream, Remind Me, &amp;amp; Watch Trailer. This experiment will inform future features only and the buttons will be removed once it’s complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For feedback: &lt;a href="https://t.co/52L43BAJsz"&gt;https://t.co/52L43BAJsz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1450869495392837632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mwscih"&gt;Twitch is also testing two other buttons. The Remind Me button will let you get a reminder for an upcoming scheduled stream, the company says. The Watch Trailer button will let you watch a channel trailer for a streamer (if they have one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbGsli"&gt;Twitch will be testing these buttons “over the next month.” Once the test is over, the buttons will be removed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Extreme heat is a growing concern for doctors around the world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hYXHk1"&gt;Extreme heat is a huge worry&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for doctors and public health experts around the world, and it’s steadily become a bigger problem over time, according to a sweeping new climate &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/countdown-health-climate"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published today in the leading medical journal, &lt;em&gt;The Lancet.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7NAat"&gt;The analysis, from 43 academic institutions and United Nations agencies, focuses on the threats the climate crisis poses to human health. While the group has published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;similar reports&lt;/a&gt; over the past five years, this is the first time it includes warnings on the impact hotter days have on mental health and physical activity. It follows an increase in devastating heatwaves around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="MnkXd3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I saw far too many patients die in the ED as a result of their heat exposure”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5gljbo"&gt;“I saw paramedics who had burns on their knees from kneeling down to care for patients with heatstroke. I saw far too many patients die in the ED as a result of their heat exposure this past year,” Jeremy Hess, a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences, global health and emergency medicine at the University of Washington, said during a press briefing this week. “These are preventable problems, and we need all hands on deck to respond and correct our course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVTK6C"&gt;Extreme heat is already a leading weather-related killer, and climate change is making heatwaves more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;frequent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;intense&lt;/a&gt;. Children and older adults especially are more vulnerable to heat-related illness and death than people of other ages. Babies under the age of one and adults over 65 experienced dramatically more days of heatwaves in 2020 compared to the baseline average from 1986 to 2005, according to the new report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQhtx1"&gt;The number of hours in a day in which it was too hot to safely work or exercise outside has also risen steadily over the past four decades, the report found. People in lower-income countries lost the most time, an average of 3.7 fewer hours in a day with safe temperatures. In 2020 alone, 295 billion hours of potential work were lost because of extreme heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D02Byf"&gt;Governments are now trying to find ways to help their populations cope with the heat. The United States last month announced plans to craft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683791/us-workers-extreme-heat-stress-workplace-protections-federal-labor-standard-osha"&gt;new protections&lt;/a&gt; for workers faced with sweltering conditions. To get the public better prepared for dangerously high temperatures, officials in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/19/seville-spain-heat-wave-names/"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637914/greece-heatwaves-names"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that they are looking into giving heatwaves names. It’s similar to the tactic used to keep people updated on hazards posed by major storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjoyhU"&gt;But physical health isn’t the only heat-related concern for doctors involved with the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; report. “There are pretty clear signals in the literature overall that extreme heat exposure is a risk for a number of different mental health concerns. This extends up to and includes suicide,” Hess said. “So it’s been a real interest for a while in the climate and health community to get a better sense of exactly who is at risk, what those risks look like, and how to track them over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuRLkK"&gt;Twitter gave the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper’s researchers one window into how people’s sentiments changed during hot days.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They studied 6 billion geolocated tweets sent from 40,000 different locations between 2015 to 2020. During heatwaves, they found a rise in “negative sentiment” and a decrease in “positive sentiment” in people’s tweets. To do that, they used a standard &lt;a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31333/LIWC2015_LanguageManual.pdf"&gt;research method&lt;/a&gt; that essentially counts the number of words deemed positive or negative in tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbgayG"&gt;Over time, people only grew more “negative” during heatwaves. “If people were adapting globally to the effects of heat, we would expect, over time, the impact of a heatwave on people’s emotional states would be attenuated,” says Kelton Minor, another co-author of the report and a PhD candidate at the University of Copenhagen’s Center for Social Data Science. Instead, they found a 155 percent jump in “negative expressions” on Twitter during heatwaves in 2020 compared to the average from 2015 to 2019 (even when controlling for other stressors like COVID-19). “The scale of the impact of heatwaves on negative sentiment is not marginal; this is a sort of large increase,” Minor says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G5Fpkg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to shine a light on the hidden corners of the true mental health impacts of climate change.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mosH47"&gt;“We need to shine a light on the hidden corners of the true mental health impacts of climate change. We know that it is impacting mental health, and this is a first step on that road in order to better understand it,” Renee Salas, an attending physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in the press briefing on the new report.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Segway’s ‘Mecha Kit’ turns your transporter into a rolling turret</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mecha Kit on Segway" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtmAOg2ts9JSLV9dCmUINbMyMjc=/12x0:1988x1317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023358/mecha_kit_demonstration_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7bGwi"&gt;If you ever wanted to transform your self-balancing scooter into a mobile mini mech, now you can with Segway-Ninebot’s Mecha Kit add-on. The kit is compatible with the Ninebot S and Ninebot S Kids and puts you in the pilot seat of your scooter-turned-turret.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Mecha Kit on Segway" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pupx-U93ne4X9CLWw_rcqdQiFDg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943300/mecha_kit_demonstration_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rsAyH"&gt;Once fitted onto your vehicle, you no longer have to stand up to drive. You can stay seated while you control your movement with dual joysticks and take aim at targets with beads of gel. And yes, it acts just like a mech — you’re able to shoot the semi-evaporating bullets while driving, spinning and drifting around. If that still doesn’t sound awesome enough, you can even customize the Mecha Kit’s RGB underglow lighting, as well as switch on some music via the built-in Bluetooth sound system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHTcs5"&gt;Segway claims that the bullets are environmentally friendly and evaporate into a powder that leaves no mess behind. You’ll get around 60,000 gel bullets included with the Mecha Kit, but it remains unclear how to order refills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Water bullets" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTrBPmoIyqCx6Um1POcfcrbFq6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943249/mecha_kit_water_bullets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The water bullets evaporate into a powder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4VoWk2"&gt;You can also connect the Mecha Kit with the Segway-Ninebot mobile app to control your vehicle remotely. The kit’s steel frame is built to “prevent deformation” and can carry passengers up to 220 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ghbQ"&gt;While the people you pass on your daily commute probably wouldn’t appreciate the barrage of gel bullets coming their way, having mecha-style battles with other Segway-owning friends and family members sounds like a lot of fun, whether for kids or adults. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Segway-Ninebot Mecha Kit up close" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giaNjomXoDkvXkJjn8xodnY-Bh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943160/segway_ninebot_mecha_kit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bZ55fz"&gt;The Mecha Kit is available for purchase on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.segway.com%2Fninebot-mecha-kit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22737058%2Fsegway-mecha-kit-rolling-water-gun-turret" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Segway-Ninebot’s website for $599.99&lt;/a&gt;, but right now, it’s on sale for $499.99. If you were to purchase the full-priced Mecha Kit with either the Segway Ninebot S or S Kids, it will cost you around $1,000. For more specifics about the Mecha Kit, you can check out all the details in the user manual on the Mecha Kit’s product page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTOTVr"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Segway decided to get a little creative with its vehicles. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/15/17571466/segway-ninebot-reportedly-making-go-kart-kit-for-scooters"&gt;the company tried turning Segways into go-karts&lt;/a&gt;. All that’s missing from this Mecha Kit are a couple of jets so we can get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlaCGX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Boring Company gets green light for Las Vegas tunnel system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-hDJZHmqJ-RF02fknQDDhX1Tw0k=/117x0:1383x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023129/IMG_20210222_152813_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwbpdX"&gt;Elon Musk’s Boring Company just won approval from local officials to move forward with building a network of vehicle tunnels underneath Las Vegas. Dubbed the “Vegas Loop,” the system will allow passengers to hitch rides in Teslas to and from places like the hotel casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, the city’s new football stadium, the Las Vegas Convention Center, and McCarran International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TwIHp"&gt;The Boring Company already operates a small version of this “Teslas in Tunnels” system underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455365/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-test-lvcc-loop-teslas"&gt;opened earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and involves two 0.8-mile tunnels. But Musk’s startup proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;a massive city-wide expansion in December 2020&lt;/a&gt; that largely lines up with what Clark County officials approved Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KTHft"&gt;The system that was approved involves 29 miles of tunnels and 51 stations. Clark County says as many as 57,000 passengers will be able to travel through it per hour and that no taxpayer money will be spent to build it. The Boring Company previously said that it would foot the bill for building the main tunnels but planned to ask hotel casinos or other businesses that want a station to pay for those construction costs. Each one of those stops has to go through its own permitting process, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/boring-co-s-plans-for-underground-loop-in-resort-corridor-approved-2463119/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ToHMVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;29 miles of tunnels and 51 stations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85eKSd"&gt;The Boring Company has been working to build out a system of tunnels underneath Las Vegas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18636326/las-vegas-people-mover-lvcc-boring-company"&gt;for a few years now&lt;/a&gt;. Over that time, Musk’s ambitions for what a tunnel-based transportation system would look like has changed. He once imagined using sleds to shuttle cars from the surface to the tunnels and back, as well as pods that would give &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17102452/elon-musk-boring-company-pedestrian-cyclist-focus"&gt;preference to cyclists and pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the company’s efforts to dig in other places have fizzled, like in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boring-company-scrubbed-la-and-dc-tunnels-from-site-2021-4#:~:text=The%20Boring%20Company%20removed%20its,hyperloops%20because%20of%20environmental%20regulations."&gt;Los Angeles, and the Northeast corridor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kLJ4U"&gt;But the final version that was built under the Las Vegas Convention Center is really just “Teslas in Tunnels” — a phrase The Boring Company even uses on its own website. The Boring Company has said the plan is to ultimately use Teslas that can drive themselves, but Musk’s other company has not yet finished creating software capable of performing that feat. So, currently, the Teslas that run under the Convention Center have human drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DYGL3s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Expanding and moving forward with plans for the "Vegas Loop." &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClarkCounty?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ClarkCounty&lt;/a&gt; Commissioners just approved an agreement with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boringcompany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@boringcompany&lt;/a&gt; to establish and maintain a transportation system that will go under the Las Vegas Strip. It will also go to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AllegiantStadm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AllegiantStadm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unlv?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@UNLV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2ju3xcFq7O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2ju3xcFq7O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Clark County Nevada (@ClarkCountyNV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ClarkCountyNV/status/1450877187779796992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVSZD3"&gt;An expansion beyond the Convention Center loop didn’t initially seem likely, as the Las Vegas Monorail had exclusive rights to provide transportation along the city’s main stretch of resorts. But the company that ran the monorail went bankrupt in 2020. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority bought up the monorail and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;subsequently killed the noncompete agreement&lt;/a&gt; that prevented The Boring Company from pursuing a larger project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyYT2b"&gt;As for why tunnels are a better solution than other transit options, The Boring Company makes this pitch on its website: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4mZuY"&gt;To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight, and won’t fall on your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u2HLi"&gt;Tunnels minimize usage of valuable surface land and do not conflict with existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate congestion in any city; no matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels can be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ih8Twj"&gt;The Boring Company has previously quoted price estimates for the Vegas Loop system that sit somewhere between that of most public transit and the cost of a taxi or ride-hailing service. It expects a five-mile trip from the airport to the Convention Center to take about five minutes and cost $10, and a 3.6-mile ride from the Convention Center to the football stadium to take four minutes and cost $6.&lt;/p&gt;
