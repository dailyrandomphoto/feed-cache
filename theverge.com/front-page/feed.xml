    <title>CES 2021 Day 2: here come the gaming laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NxhXOk8TF8grWncToTww4BD8mc=/1x0:3652x2434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68660086/blade15hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCBjay"&gt;Yesterday, AMD and Nvidia took to the CES virtual stage to announce their respective updates. AMD headlined with a new series of CPUs, the 7nm Ryzen 5000 series, that is going to be a really compelling gaming laptop option. Nvidia headlined with new graphics for laptops, bringing some performance that was previously exclusive to desktop machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWa3fM"&gt;With all the parts from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel out, the laptops made up of those parts were free to be announced. And so we had a very, very large pile of gaming laptops to sift through from Asus, Razer, Acer, Lenovo, Gigabyte, Dell, and Origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrATYj"&gt;They’re all linked below and taken in sum I am optimistic that it is going to be a very good year for gaming laptops. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that you won’t still notice some graphical compromises — of course desktops will be better — but the ones that sting the most could be smoothed over. Getting legitimately high frame rates at 1440p with respectable graphics settings is more than I honestly expected out of 2021. (Assuming, of course, that any of these computers live up to those claims in actual use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="eaX7P3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9028921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ryq24r"&gt;Those laptops and the components that power them were the biggest &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; news yesterday, but CES is just as much about &lt;em&gt;concepts. &lt;/em&gt;Specifically concept gadgets that are almost guaranteed to never land on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wi7Vry"&gt;Are they attention-seeking vaporware? Quite often. 2021 may be TCL’s year to flex, but it’s also a year for it to engage in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;weird flex — by showing off two more of its rollable, extendable display concepts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow8o3c"&gt;Are concepts worth a look if only to get a sense of what might actually be released someday? Actually, maybe yes! &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;LG, for example, claims that its Rollable phone is real and launching in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Hazel" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jnx4UmRFWu7CkemWUzDgnv5oDn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228437/hazelnight.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J0b2HI"&gt;Razer’s concept mask: Project Hazel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LxXVYo"&gt;Then there’s the concept that by all indications (including reader attention on our website) has won the show: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Razer’s concept N95 mask with RGB and voice projection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNVuwz"&gt;I will admit, when I first saw that Razer had a concept mask with gamer-themed color lights I was not happy. My fear for this entire CES has been that a major company would try to take advantage of the pandemic to gather attention to itself with a gadget that isn’t scientifically sound. CES is always awash in dubious health tech, but the risk of people believing in bad health tech seems even higher this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0guIU"&gt;But then, well, it seems like Razer has thoughtfully considered a lot of the very real problems masks cause and tried to account for them. It looks like one of those actually-unsafe vented masks, but those vents have filters the company wants to make N95-grade. It’s clear, so people can read your lips. It will have some sort of audio system (with help from THX) that will solve for the muffled voices masks can cause. It should seal tightly against your nose to help with fogging glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3oPnKT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvWiCclESL8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JrqCBd"&gt;All that sounds neat — neater than RGB lights anyway. But neat does not equal real, and this is very much like a concept car to my mind. In the &lt;a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/razer-unveils-smart-mask-and-gaming-chair-concept-designs-at-ces-2021/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Razer’s language not only skirts the issue of a price and release date, it also skirts the issue of releasing a mask with this exact design at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZIfxKZ"&gt;The smart mask concept will continue to be optimized through rigorous testing and user feedback to ensure safety compliance and maximum comfort and usability. Design improvements will also be ongoing to support the evolving user needs and to deliver value without compromising functionality and performance. Project Hazel will be foundational to Razer’s ongoing support and commitment to public health and safety within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pvTPMI"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it is “working with a team of medical experts and scientists,” but if Razer decides to actually produce and sell this mask, I expect — and you should demand — that it seek the “necessary approvals and certifications from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmWJTt"&gt;As a rule, I am more generous than most when I see a CES concept because I know what they really are: fantasies with a purpose. Some of that purpose is absolutely marketing, but some of it is to show us ideas for products that are more imaginative or better than what’s available today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1A55e"&gt;Motives — especially when it comes to corporate beneficence— don’t need to be and rarely are pure. Just because Razer grabbed our attention with RGB lights doesn’t undo the good of converting a production line to making masks and then donating a million of them to healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99wlu8"&gt;Of course, no amount of engineering can solve the biggest mask problem in the US: too many people are refusing to wear them. Please: wear a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LdSfsN"&gt;AMD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1256011616"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD’s 7nm Ryzen 5000 mobile processors promise 2021’s best gaming notebooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; AMD is building on the gains it made last year and appears to be pushing to establish itself as a CPU fixture in the laptop market instead of a somewhat rare alternative. Though as my colleague Monica Chin points out to me, that rarity was due in part to the fact that models with AMD chips seemed to be in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKza3b"&gt;I think the company has a very good chance of doing just that. I will leave a full-on “AMD vs. Intel” analysis for somebody else (or at least wait for real-world results once laptops start shipping), but it doesn’t take a genius to see that AMD is not to be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Job5pQ"&gt;In other words: 2021 could be the year we stop thinking about Ryzen as an alternative to Intel, but instead just a straight up competitor again. Intel could be at risk of no longer being the “default” to a lot of potential customers. That’s not to dismiss Intel entirely, as Chin notes we still need to see what laptops with Tiger Lake H chips are like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nIFXQt"&gt;AMD has announced its new Ryzen 5000 mobile CPUs. Most (but not all) of them are based on the company’s 7nm “Zen 3” architecture. AMD CEO Lisa Su called the series “the most powerful PC processors ever built.” ... The big question will be how these processors compare to Intel’s new Tiger Lake H systems — the company announced those chips yesterday at its CES 2021 keynote. All three of those chips (including two Core i7s and one Core i5) max out at 35W and have just four cores and eight threads — half the count of Ryzen’s top offerings. However, Intel says there’s an eight-core processor with speeds up to 5GHz coming “later this quarter.” That’s likely what AMD has to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1255994951"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227144/amd-rdna-2-gpu-gaming-laptops-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD says RDNA 2 GPU-powered laptops will arrive in the first half of 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QHPd6x"&gt;RDNA 2 is AMD’s new graphics chip architecture and the foundation of the custom chipsets in Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series S / X, and now it’s coming to laptops. ... The Radeon RX 6000 series of GPUs were the first to feature AMD’s new RDNA 2 architecture when they were unveiled in October of last year, but those were top-of-the-line desktop graphics cards designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s 3000 series line. ... Today at CES, AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company is “on track to launch the first notebooks with RDNA 2 in the first half of the year with our partners,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227638/amd-threadripper-pro-available-directly-to-consumers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD will be letting consumers buy the Threadripper Pro directly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;This is definitely for professional use. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1349132593619460098"&gt;Tom Warren notes&lt;/a&gt;, “64 cores, 128 threads, and 2TB of memory all sounds amazing until you realize the processor alone is $3,990.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1256020013"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1256007449"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia is bringing its RTX 3080 to laptops on January 26th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia showed a demo of a Razer Blade 15 running a full three-screen rig with &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, which is a very good sign that many of the planned 70+ laptops with these GPUs will have the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8gSxY4"&gt;Less than six months after introducing its RTX 3000 series GPUs for desktop PCs, Nvidia is bringing the RTX 3060, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 to gaming laptops. Nvidia is promising big energy efficiency gains here, thanks to its new Ampere architecture, alongside the obvious performance improvements over the previous RTX 2000 series laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nQWnM7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia announces $329 GeForce RTX 3060, available in February&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1256007905"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226560/nvidia-resizable-bar-support-intel-amd-smart-access-memory-feature"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia answers AMD’s Smart Access Memory with its own boost to frame rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kla7gk"&gt;Laptops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jqqW1u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/12/22227043/swedish-metal-band-lenovo-legion-5i-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We gave this laptop a 7, then a Swedish metal band turned it up to 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This has nothing to do with CES and is related to a laptop that’s half a year old. But just... just watch this. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZpSBR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Razer’s 2021 Blade laptops are getting QHD screens and Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series graphics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PUSF5o"&gt;Until recently, 1080p and 4K were the only options for displays on gaming laptops, despite 1440p being an increasingly popular choice among PC gamers looking for a new standalone monitor. ... The higher-end Blade laptops will be equipped with Nvidia’s new RTX 3000-series graphics chips, and so should have an easy time running most games on a 1440p high refresh rate display. The Blade 15 Advanced (Razer’s name for the more powerful variant) with the RTX 3070 and a QHD screen with G-Sync will cost $2,499.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RFBPeU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227383/asus-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptops-ryzen-price-specs-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asus updates Zephyrus G14 and G15 with latest AMD and Nvidia chips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I bought a G14 last year myself and agree with Monica Chin, it was one of the best. These updates look solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1256007188"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227013/lenovo-legion-7-slim-5-pro-gaming-laptops-amd-ryzen-5000-cpu-nvidia-rtx-gpu-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenovo’s new Legion gaming laptops go all in on AMD’s latest Ryzen chips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wKZ1jR"&gt;Acer is ditching the garish, colorful lights and logos on the Predator Triton 300 for a more restrained — dare I say, professional — all-metal design that wouldn’t be out of place in an office or a classroom, while still offering top-notch gaming hardware on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="A83SCb"&gt;Weird laptops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7G43OJ"&gt;The ThinkBook Plus debuted at last year’s CES, standing out as a laptop with an E Ink display built into the lid that allowed users to take notes, read ebooks, and display things like calendar information. ... The new model improves on that, though, with a 12-inch, 2560 x 1600 E Ink panel that supports multitouch and works with the pop-out stylus, creating what should be a more enjoyable E Ink experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NVmeeK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226223/asus-rog-flow-x13-zephyrus-duo-15-se-gaming-laptop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asus ROG’s 2021 lineup includes its first convertible gaming laptop (ish)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a weird one. Gaming laptops are usually neither convertible not 13 inches. Then there’s the GPU situation, which also involves some ...let’s call them &lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt;. However, if you want a gaming laptop that can do double or triple duty for other laptop things, it may be worth understanding those choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1256019830"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NApQw1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HiIb5d"&gt;GM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="C0aQIS"&gt;The refreshed Bolt will feature a sportier look, new seats, adaptive cruise control, and a few other minor changes. GM bumped up the range in this past year’s version of the Bolt, from 238 miles to 259 miles, but no further increase is expected in the refresh. ... The new Bolts can’t come quick enough, given the controversy surrounding the current versions of the EV. GM was recently slapped with a class action lawsuit alleging that the Chevy Bolt’s battery is “prone to burst into flames.” The lawsuit comes on the heels of GM announcing that it was recalling 68,000 Bolts over a malfunctioning battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1256018834"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226778/gm-flying-car-cadillac-halo-av-evtol-concept-autonomous-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GM surprises with autonomous Cadillac and flying car concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It wouldn’t be CES without some weirdo car concepts, and thankfully Cadillac has delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="q3LwjN"&gt;The automaker showed off a luxury egg-shaped autonomous vehicle and a single-seater electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft during its keynote address on Tuesday. Both vehicles are part of Cadillac’s Halo Portfolio and probably won’t be going into production anytime soon — or at all. ... Still, the concepts are meant to show off Cadillac’s (and, by extension, GM’s) design intentions for future products, as well as serving as an extravagant symbol of the brand’s manufacturing skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1256018714"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226760/gm-cadillac-celestiq-electric-luxury-tease-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GM teases Cadillac Celestiq EV with adjustable glass roof and full-width touchscreen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This is definitely a tease, not a reveal. But the adjustable glass roof looks cool.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Which tech made it to our homes, and which will stay only in our hearts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="AcsboQ"&gt;Looking through the deluge of CES articles is like staring into an unreliable crystal ball: maybe what you’re looking at is the future, the shape of tech for years to come, or maybe it’s something that’ll get talked about for a week and never heard from again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRGZNZ"&gt;That’s why we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;like to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047745/ces-2019-best-tech-gadgets-lg-rollable-samsung-the-wall-retrospective-what-happened"&gt;take some time to look back&lt;/a&gt; at the biggest hits from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21058850/ces-2020-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget"&gt;CES shows of yesteryear&lt;/a&gt;. What looked like it was just a one-off at the largest tech tradeshow in the world, but actually turned out to be a real product? What got a lot of buzz and then dropped off our radars, only to resurface months later? And, of course, what was simply too good to be true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IywiYS"&gt;In that spirit, let’s look at the most popular devices from CES 2020, as well as some products from even further back that are still kicking around in our minds, and ask “hey, whatever happened to the...?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="jLTzDl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;Alienware Concept UFO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qlE6lM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;No indication it’ll move out of the concept stage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuerRB"&gt;Alienware’s Concept UFO was a dream machine: a Nintendo Switch-style handheld device powered by the type of components you’d find in a budget gaming PC. It could run &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat 11 &lt;/em&gt;in our brief demo time with the device last year — and it was in fact a real, working prototype with detachable controllers and a handheld Switch-style mode for playing on the go. Alienware pitched the Concept UFO as the type of radical gadget that could make PC gaming more accessible by cramming a full Windows 10 platform into something you could carry out of the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhbHjO"&gt;Unfortunately, the Concept UFO remains just that — a concept. We’ve not seen or heard anything of the device since last January, and that was to be expected. Alienware would not confirm at the time it had any intention of making a real, consumer version of its Windows handheld. That’s sad, because among the many frivolous and often indulgent prototypes and concepts at a trade show like CES, the Concept UFO was precisely the type of product we’d actually want to see on the market. There’s always next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="The LG rollable display is now a real 65-inch TV|62098" data-volume-uuid="781309967" data-volume-id="62098" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-927" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hRZUwH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;LG’s rollable OLED TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RgIElQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Someone probably actually owns one now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI7WpU"&gt;LG comes to CES every year to show off a slate of both real products and not-so-real products, with the latter category populated by its experimental brand of shape-shifting displays. The main event for LG this past few years has been a rollable OLED screen that can expand from a small base station into a massive panel — the kind of futuristic tech we used to only dream about. The catch: despite LG’s constant claims otherwise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171013/lg-rollable-tv-oled-4k-tv-features-photos-video-release-ces-2019"&gt;this thing kept missing its release windows&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXwLg6"&gt;And then something miraculous happened: it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;finally came out&lt;/a&gt; — in South Korea only. Sure, at $87,000, it costs in the same ballpark as the most premium Tesla you can buy. But it did go on sale, and presumably someone out there actually bought it. LG has since moved on from using its rollable TV as the experimental centerpiece of its CES showing, choosing instead its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;new rollable smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that device is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;coming in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll believe it when we see it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXxVfwFPRl6WZqlNGWe5Pg6VIGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19570874/segway.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PONKt9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047217/segway-s-pod-personal-vehicle-self-balancing-wheelchair-ces-2020"&gt;Segway S-Pod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ughDzt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status:  &lt;/strong&gt;Vaporware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj02Gz"&gt;Segway’s S-Pod brought back that old-school, “what in the hell” CES vibe we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;have often yearned for in recent years. The S-Pod is an egg-shaped motorized wheelchair of sorts powered by the same gyroscopic self-balancing technology you see in Segway’s traditional and iconic two-wheeled scooters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngLfW9"&gt;But in what feels like some deranged head nod to the Hoverchair from Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;WALL-E&lt;/em&gt;, this thing can travel 24 miles per hour, fast enough to make it an alarming hazard for the rider and anything that gets in their way in pretty much any public setting. If that’s not the kind of Las Vegas-style opulence CES is known for, we don’t know what is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYGELx"&gt;Sadly, the S-Pod is not really anywhere to be found a year later. At the time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047217/segway-s-pod-personal-vehicle-self-balancing-wheelchair-ces-2020"&gt;Segway told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it planned a 2020 launch for businesses and a 2021 launch for consumers, though it didn’t yet have a price to announce. Now, the S-Pod is listed on Segway’s website as a concept, something it definitely wasn’t pitched as back at CES 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6oh-vKBe9htdRU4MKalEHS8Gud8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19580944/razer_tomahawk_2200.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DsMQnB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054602/razer-tomahawk-desktop-gaming-pc-intel-nuc-element-design-specs-ces-2020"&gt;Razer Tomahawk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q67RwZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Dicey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CisL2u"&gt;When the Razer Tomahawk was announced at CES 2020, it was reminiscent of a dream from CES 2014: the one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285130/razer-reveals-project-christine-the-concept-gaming-pc-even-a-toddler"&gt;the modular desktop computer&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, most desktop gaming PCs are modular, but Razor’s vision for the concept was simple and clean: there’s a box, and in that box there’s another box that does the computing, alongside a graphics card. No bending pins trying to put in a CPU, no getting a motherboard that’s DOA, just an Intel compute unit and a graphics card slotted into a (frankly astonishingly) small case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaATKi"&gt;At the moment, it’s hard to call this dream realized. The Tomahawk was supposed to launch in July, but July came and went with no computer. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/10/21510415/razer-tomahawk-pc-case-atx-matx-itx-mini-sff-third-attempt"&gt;Razer launched a computer case&lt;/a&gt;, devoid of any compute units, which it also called the Tomahawk, perhaps a throwback to the never-shipped Tomahawk Elite case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18170800/razer-amazon-alexa-chroma-lighting-effects-tomahawk-elite-case-ces-2019"&gt;it showed off at CES 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22151862/razer-tomahawk-modular-desktop-gaming-pc-available-price-specs"&gt;it finally happened&lt;/a&gt;: the Tomahawk desktop computer with the Intel NUC and a RTX 3080 finally went up for pre-order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtSQVi"&gt;Er... maybe. As far as we can tell, it’s been listed as out of stock since then, and so far I haven’t been able to find anyone online claiming to have gotten theirs. I contacted Razer to ask if it had actually started shipping the computers yet, but at time of writing I hadn’t heard back. Needless to say, I’m not quite ready to call this one done, until packages start hitting doors, and until stock becomes available again. As for the Intel NUC that formed the heart of this computer...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="5S4R6F"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Exclusive: Inside Intel’s tiny modular gaming PC|74595" data-volume-uuid="c71a09bed" data-volume-id="74595" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-356" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG8ryz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Intel NUC 9 Extreme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fr1T4F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status:&lt;/strong&gt; On sale, but when are upgrades coming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZCVyZ"&gt;Intel’s NUC concept has been around for a while (I even used a 2017 NUC 7 as my main computer for a year or two), but CES 2020 was the first time that Intel really tried to sell the concept to hardcore gamers. The pitch was that the NUC 9 Extreme could be a tiny, fully upgradable modular gaming computer, with users really only needing to worry about a computing card and a graphics card. But the concept would only work if Intel kept the compute cards updated, and actually released upgrades that consumers could buy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6mrmm"&gt;You knew where this is going, right? This year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;Intel announced its 11th generation CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, and yet the &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/elements/nuc-compute-elements.html"&gt;most recent compute units you can buy&lt;/a&gt; for the NUC 9 are still using Intel’s 9th Gen chips. That’s forgivable for existing owners, since the NUC 9 only went on sale last April, but it’s a little worrying we haven’t heard about any upgrade boards yet after a promise they’d be coming each year for two years. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234333/intel-nuc-9-extreme-mini-pc-ghost-canyon-gaming-review-price-specs-features"&gt;form factor is still exciting&lt;/a&gt;, it seems hard to justify dropping that much cash on the ecosystem until Intel shows more dedication. Cautionary tale: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;Alienware Area-51m’&lt;/a&gt;s similar CES dream of an unusually upgradable gaming rig was dashed after just one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GZDUXY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status:&lt;/strong&gt; We have proof of life &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDtULS"&gt;I think it’s fair to say that a fully functional electric car &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056404/sony-vision-s-electric-concept-prototype-first-look-ces-2020"&gt;wasn’t on most people’s radar&lt;/a&gt; when they were theorizing about what Sony would show off at CES 2020. But that’s exactly what Sony showed off with its Vision-S Concept, and it made one fact very clear: you cannot buy one of these. So while we weren’t expecting it to be out on the streets in February, we did wonder if Sony had built an entire car just to show off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzFak4"&gt;The answer appears to be no. It’s still not on sale, or even rumored to be on sale, but it seems that Sony’s been &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33482352/sony-vision-s-prototype-testing/"&gt;testing it on public roads since July&lt;/a&gt;. The car also got some airtime in Sony’s CES presentation this year, but that didn’t seem to come with much new information other than &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/vision-s/news.html#entry8"&gt;that testing of the car had begun in Austria&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to tell what the future holds for this car, but we at least have confirmation that Sony’s still working on it, and is willing to share at least some details on its progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Qi25Jo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Delayed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQiqXd"&gt;Speaking of electric cars, Fisker showing one off was more than we expected from Sony, but the company’s Ocean SUV still managed to make a splash. Part of that interest could’ve been due to the solar-panel roof, or the aggressive $37,500 starting price tag, or, maybe people were just interested in seeing if Fisker would actually be able to get a car to the mass market this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dz80B2"&gt;Either way, at the announcement Fisker stated that the SUV was slated to launch at the end of 2021 or at the beginning of 2022, but that’s &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34143249/fisker-ocean-electric-crossover-details/"&gt;now been pushed back to “late 2022”&lt;/a&gt;. The car does still seem to be in development from the latest news, with reports coming out that Fisker has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/15/business/fisker-ocean-electric-suv-magna-international/index.html"&gt;found a manufacturing contractor to actually build the car&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever it releases, Fisker is really going to have to deliver, seeing as the competing Tesla Model Y and Mustang Mach-E will have been on the road for a while at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pngih0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;It exists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THOCee"&gt;When Samsung announced at CES 2020 that the Sero, its TV that used motors to switch from landscape to portrait, was going to be available outside of Korea, the response seemed to be a resounding “uh... why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sILxxC"&gt;But the mocking of the masses didn’t stop it from hitting store shelves. This summer, the Sero blew all the doubters away, showing that the form factor was not just appropriate, but in fact elevated the medium of internet video in ways... no, I’m just kidding, the &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/the-sero"&gt;reviews were pretty middling&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it’s nice to see something that seemed like it could just as easily have been a CES pipe dream go on sale to consumers. You could &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/the-sero/43-class-the-sero-tv-qled-4k-uhd-hdr-smart-tv-qn43ls05tafxza/#benefits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;actually buy one right now&lt;/a&gt; if you really wanted, because, while it’s apparently not a great viewing experience, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one of the few TVs that’s built to do what it does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3RM9bG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Real and real expensive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Itc5k"&gt;Keeping on the topic of TVs, the show-stopping ones at CES are always ahead of their time, with resolutions and screen technologies debuting years before mere mortals start to get their hands on them. Samsung continued that trend at CES 2020 with its all-screen 8K TV, the Q950. At the time, the company didn’t announce a price, but the TV has since gone on sale... for a cool $10,999.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScYYHO"&gt;Samsung, and others, have since released 8K TVs around the $2,000 price range, but a year later, there’s still not a ton of value in buying an 8K TV. There’s only a handful of cameras that can shoot in 8K, and almost no one is mastering and releasing in the resolution. Outside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;very uppermost echelons of PC gaming&lt;/a&gt;, you’d be hard-pressed to find a device that can even output in full resolution to an 8K TV: while the new Xbox Series X and PS5 do physically support it, their operating systems don’t yet (though that didn’t stop Sony from putting it on the box).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guF2Fo"&gt;Speaking of the PS5...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xSV2Cm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;A powerful purchase... if you can find one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4zuI4"&gt;CES is rarely a place for console gaming — that’s more the purview of E3. But PlayStation maker Sony does show up every year, usually to announce new televisions, home audio, and other gadgets. Last year, we got all hyped up for a big PlayStation 5 announce which turned out to be... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21019829/sony-playstation-5-ps5-logo-reveal-ps4-users-numbers-ces-2020"&gt;the logo&lt;/a&gt;. That’s all we got, with the reveal seeming even more overblown by the fact the PS5 logo is pretty much identical to the PS4 one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLM8XW"&gt;Of course, most of us know that the rest of the year’s PS5-related announcements were much more exciting. Sony, like many other gaming companies, skipped E3 amid the coronavirus pandemic (though the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063737/sony-ps5-e3-2020-skip-again-launch-new-console-generation"&gt;made that decision&lt;/a&gt; before COVID-19 arrived in the US). In April, we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/7/21212722/sony-dualsense-controller-playstation-5-ps5-announcement-hardware"&gt;DualSense controller for the first time&lt;/a&gt;, followed by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21212989/ps5-playstation-5-console-announcement-design-hardware-specs-sony"&gt;official hardware review in June&lt;/a&gt;. And in September, we got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21277234/ps5-playstation-5-price-release-date-sony"&gt;launch-day slate and price reveal at long last&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;official November launch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gy4yfC"&gt;Now, a year later, the PS5 is actually in consumers’ homes, if you’ve been lucky enough to get your hands on one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Ve0sj0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Not worth your time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrzTp9"&gt;Withings got some interest with its ScanWatch, which promised to detect atrial fibrillation and measure blood oxygen levels during the wearer’s sleep. It also doesn’t look like a smartwatch, so it promised to provide all the health tracking that people wanted but in a form factor they were more comfortable with. Unfortunately, reviewers found it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;lacking in a couple of key areas&lt;/a&gt;, but for many people that doesn’t even matter — the watch still hasn’t been cleared by the FDA, so it can’t be sold in the US, though it is available elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="j92wXw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1319003364034740227?lang=en"&gt;It went full Go90&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbecHA"&gt;It’s rare you get a slow-motion car crash in the tech or media industries as visible and painful to watch as Quibi. But there it was: a brand-new streaming service with nearly $2 billion in funding, a seriously impressive slate of talent aboard, and two well-known industry figures from the world of Silicon Valley (HP’s Meg Whitman) and Hollywood (big-shot film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg) working together to realize their vision of a mobile-centric video app that could transcend the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17516266/verizon-shutting-down-go90-original-video-content-app"&gt;sorry fates of the Verizon Go90’s of the past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6glAw"&gt;Quibi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056315/quibi-ces-2020-launch-meg-whitman-jeffrey-katzenberg-turnstyle-technology-shows-preview"&gt;came to CES 2020 last year&lt;/a&gt; to sort of, not really soft-launch the service, despite being unwilling to even show the app before its official April debut. And the rest is Quistory, as us Quibi aficionados like to say (just kidding, we made that up). The app came out in April, when the coronavirus pandemic was in full swing and much of the US was sheltering in place and learning to adapt to the new normal of life during COVID-19. That could have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/5/21202564/quibi-launch-streaming-short-form-video-date-price-jeffrey-katzenberg"&gt;bolstered Quibi’s chances for success&lt;/a&gt;, but the company was ill-equipped to handle the new reality. It failed to launch critical features, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285760/quibi-google-chromecast-support-feature-launch-apple-airplay-tv-shows"&gt;AirPlay and Chromecast support&lt;/a&gt;, fast enough, and it didn’t even deliver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526039/quibi-apple-tv-android-fire-apps-trouble"&gt;native streaming set-top box apps until October&lt;/a&gt;, a full six months after launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3AJuE"&gt;On top of all that, Quibi’s content... well, it sucked. There were no viral hits and few outside media circles seemed to care that Quibi had launched at all. This disastrous recipe culminated in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21559189/quibi-final-days-streaming-platform-coronavirus"&gt;eventual shutdown announced in October&lt;/a&gt;, which everyone except Katzenberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21559189/quibi-final-days-streaming-platform-coronavirus"&gt;seemed to see coming months prior&lt;/a&gt;. Roku has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;scooped up the app’s content library&lt;/a&gt; after Quibi turned the lights off in early December. The company’s legacy now doubles as a cautionary tale, proving that money and connections and an old-school Hollywood mentality can’t create a new hit video app out of thin air. Especially not when your competition on mobile is the organic, user-generated gold just a few taps away on TikTok and Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ym9u9o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Still waiting on desktop cards, but laptop versions are starting to appear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtAKDV"&gt;Intel showing off its discrete GPU at CES last year was really one thing masquerading as another: the eye-catching part was an honest-to-goodness graphics card that you could slot into your desktop, made by Intel. But what Intel was really showing off was its dedicated graphics technology, the Xe architecture. So far, we haven’t seen that desktop card, though &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16211/intels-dg1-gpu-coming-to-discrete-desktop-cards-next-year-oemonly"&gt;there are rumors that it’s coming&lt;/a&gt; sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHFtm0"&gt;Intel’s dedicated Xe graphics, however, have started showing up in various laptops. Of course, we’ve seen Xe graphics tech in Tiger Lake’s integrated GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release"&gt;and been impressed&lt;/a&gt;, but there are also laptops with Intel’s Iris Xe Max — a separate, totally dedicated graphics chip. And how is it? Well... &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-tests-intel-iris-xe-max-is-no-gaming-powerhouse"&gt;for gaming, it often gets beat by integrated graphics&lt;/a&gt;, which may explain why we haven’t seen a desktop version yet. It does have other use cases, such as video encoding, but it seems like the dream of Intel being a third competitor to AMD and Nvidia in terms of gaming graphics is some way off at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2dm32R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Immediately outclassed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yn1VCP"&gt;When it was announced at CES 2020, the system was one of the cheaper ways to get a Wi-Fi 6 mesh network. It managed to launch on time, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/netgear-nighthawk-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-review/"&gt;but the reviews were pretty mediocre&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s got &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-wi-fi-mesh-network-systems"&gt;plenty of Wi-Fi 6 competition&lt;/a&gt;. But if you really like the design, it is actually available for purchase on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="716Q4x"&gt;This product’s fate really goes to show what a difference a year can make — we were excited about Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems at last year’s CES, but that’s old hat now. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;all about Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt; now, baby. And, of course, mesh systems using that newer tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22213115/tp-link-wifi-6e-first-routers-mesh-smart-speaker"&gt;have been announced at this year’s CES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="A5OVt6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Available but iffy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKd3Xf"&gt;What set GE’s Smart Switch announcement apart from the crowd was compatibility — they came in a standard four-wire version that could be wired into modern lighting systems, but they also came in a three-wire version that could be installed in almost any home without a neutral wire. This was a feature decidedly uncommon in the smart home space, which is what makes the reviews for these switches such a shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbxAqj"&gt;To be clear, they did actually come out. I always see them at my local Lowes. But looking at the Amazon or Best Buy reviews, it’s clear a lot of buyers are not having a great experience with their software. And while that’s something that could be fixed, it’s never recommended that you buy something based on the promise that it could be good later, doubly true if you’ll be wiring that thing into your walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YDdgrp"&gt;Samsung’s Ballie robot was supposed to be, as the name implied, a spherical robot that helped you out around the house. Samsung made no promises about shipping or price, and we’ve heard pretty much nothing since. I reached out to Samsung to ask if the Ballie was being worked on and it responded with a statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OqjLH5"&gt;We continue to develop the core technologies of our concept robots, including Ballie to deliver new and unique experiences and functionality. In fact, this year we have applied one of Ballie’s core technologies to JetBot90+ AI as we continue to push the boundaries of home assistant technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6gBwPl"&gt;I do have to say, though, that the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/ces-2021-jetbot-ai-robotic-vacuum-laundry-automated-home-cleaning/"&gt;JetBot 90 AI Plus&lt;/a&gt; is far less cute than the Ballie. Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="e5DZMZ"&gt;Okay, we’re aware that Charmin’s robot built to bring you toilet rolls was mostly a joke, but how perfect that this was what kicked off our 2020. It obviously hasn’t come out as a product that you can buy, but maybe this year Charmin can announce a battle bot that’ll fight other bots at the grocery store to snag you the last package of TP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7n8bkl"&gt;The MarsCat from Elephant Robotics stole a lot of hearts and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QZTwX7yZE"&gt;even ended up on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show&lt;/a&gt;. It launched as a Kickstarter right before CES 2020, with the company saying early backers would get their robotic companions in March of 2020. Today, it’s on Indiegogo, and it doesn’t seem like anyone has received theirs yet. The ship date is now March 2021, and the company’s been releasing updates and YouTube videos, but it seems like we’re seeing the common crowdfunding story play out here again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TeWIMW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Pivoted to enterprise so you’ll never ask about it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SH1RBp"&gt;Nothing screams vaporware quite like the phrase “artificial human.” Yet Samsung’s Neon, despite the lack of concrete details on the purported artificial intelligence project, generated an alarming amount of buzzy press while remaining shrouded in mystery. So it goes at CES, where any kind of breakthrough tech is hyped up to infinity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1hheX"&gt;What Neon actually ended up being was a digital avatar project with some impressive facial animation technology, but nothing anywhere close to the artificial human benchmark the company repeatedly set for itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuiIQh"&gt;Where is Neon now? Not on Galaxy smartphones as a chatbot, or on any smartphone, app, website, or game for that matter. No, instead Neon has apparently shifted to an enterprise solution in the form of an API businesses can use to enhance real-time conversation needs like customer service, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-neon-availability-1185235/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Neon project lead Pranav Mistry has since walked back his comments about a consumer version of Neon coming to Samsung devices. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20760837/bixby-samsung-galaxy-note-10-unpacked-event"&gt;Bixby&lt;/a&gt;, could we really expect anything less? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1lZcIO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current status: &lt;/strong&gt;Awesome but out of stock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myjPf5"&gt;The Samsung Odyssey G9 demanded attention through its specs and sheer physical size — it’s a 49-inch, 240Hz, curved gaming monitor with phenomenal resolution and brightness. Show attendees were dazzled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys6mIF"&gt;It launched at an eye-watering $1,500, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;and when we reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; we did have to wonder whether “the ultimate ultrawide” was what we were really looking for. What we didn’t question, however, is that this monitor was absolutely deserving of that title. Actually getting your hands on the monitor, though, has been less thrilling. Early buyers reported a variety of issues, which slowly got fixed, but now you suddenly can’t buy it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6JFny"&gt;It seems like it’s &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace/comments/hra4c1/bh_samsung_49_odyssey_g9_discontinued/"&gt;no longer easily available outside of eBay&lt;/a&gt; — Samsung tells us the reason stores are showing them as unavailable is due to “an unprecedented demand,” and says it’s definitely not discontinued, but I can’t put a product you’re not actually able to buy in the Winner’s Circle, now can I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="66AL1t"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 was one of the first laptops announced with Ryzen 4000, which were the first chips to bring AMD’s Zen 2 architecture to laptops. While we knew that Zen 2 was good on desktops, it wasn’t proven in mobile — and the G14 didn’t have a price, so whether it would be a good deal or not was also an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NABg3a"&gt;That question has been answered: the G14 launched starting at $1,049, but the real sweet spot was the $1,449 model with an RTX 2060 Max-Q. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; loved its design and gaming prowess&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve personally recommended it to a friend or two (and I’ve heard good things from the ones who bought it.) And look, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227383/asus-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptops-ryzen-price-specs-ces-2021"&gt;it just got a sequel at this year’s CES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="amuGeX"&gt;Sex toys, and the Lora DiCarlo company in particular, have a rocky history with CES. At CES 2019, the company’s Osé Robotic Massager won an Innovation Award in robotics and drones — and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173954/ces-lora-dicarlo-sex-toy-award-revoked"&gt;CES took the award away&lt;/a&gt; and barred Lora DiCarlo from exhibiting, citing some pretty shaky reasoning. The company, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051259/lora-dicarlo-sex-tech-toy-massager-awards-ban-ose-ces-2020"&gt;was allowed back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and was able to show off its products. As a bonus, the toys it showed actually exist, and are available for purchase (if you can afford their relatively high price tags, that is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to5RJJ"&gt;What we didn’t know when all this drama happened at the beginning of the year, however, was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/style/sex-toys-online-coronavirus.html"&gt;what a great year the sex toy industry was about to have&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic putting restrictions on any kind of socializing. In a year where a song as explicit as “WAP” &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9452973/cardi-b-wap-number-one-fourth-week-hot-100"&gt;was number one on the charts for weeks&lt;/a&gt;, it seems this CES controversy may have been one of the most portentous things to come out of the show in 2020. Here’s to a better (and less lonely) 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is making young teens’ accounts more private by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UA9m-N0G5IAAhvFuBgxOS2f1UQ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659863/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzKahB"&gt;When a young teenager signs up for TikTok, their account will now be more private by default. TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/strengthening-privacy-and-safety-for-youth"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s updating the default settings for users aged 13 to 15, limiting who can see and comment on their videos. Only users who they add as friends will be able to view their videos, and their account won’t be suggested to other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pU0MVn"&gt;TikTok will also completely disable the option to let anyone comment on these users’ videos, even if they make their account public. Users between 13 and 15 will only be able to allow their friends to comment on their videos, or they can turn off comments altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tVUQQN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok has been gradually adding more privacy controls and restrictions for younger users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LLmNLn"&gt;The app’s Duet and Stitch features, which allow users to repost and respond to another person’s video, will be disabled for videos posed by users under 16. The ability to download videos of users under that age is also being disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txQVZg"&gt;For users between 16 and 17, TikTok is disabling the ability to download their videos by default and restricting the Duet and Stitch features to just their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvHFpi"&gt;The suite of tweaks should add up to a TikTok that’s more protective of its youngest users. Those users can still, by and large, use TikTok the way anyone else can, but the app is doing more to shield those users and their videos from the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EpPs8"&gt;TikTok has been gradually adding more privacy controls for teenagers’ accounts over the past year. In 2020, the app started allowing parents to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222817/tiktok-family-pairing-linked-accounts"&gt;remotely set restrictions on a child’s account&lt;/a&gt; and later began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570244/tiktok-parental-controls-family-pairing-private-accounts-search-limits"&gt;allowing parents to tweak their kid’s privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;, too. TikTok also previously disabled direct messaging for users under 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXaG1D"&gt;This is all a substantial turnaround from how TikTok’s predecessor handled kids’ accounts. TikTok had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243312/tiktok-ftc-fine-musically-children-coppa-age-gate"&gt;pay $5.7 million in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to settle allegations that the older app, Musical.ly, failed to gain parental approval for kids under 13. TikTok now has a separate app experience called “TikTok for Younger Users” that just shows curated videos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sure enough, EVGA and Zotac have raised prices on the Nvidia RTX 3080 and beyond</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEn7yvPMObuEyI8hrM8QYfmNbWI=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659851/evga_geforce_rtx_3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FzAUbf"&gt;Nvidia and AMD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;addressed the great GPU shortage today&lt;/a&gt;, revealing it may take many months before you’ll easily find a card like the RTX 3080 on shelves. They &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; say how much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;a renewed Trump import tax on graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; might impact their prices — but now, Nvidia partners EVGA and Zotac may have done that for us &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XABjgg"&gt;Both graphics card manufacturers have now raised their prices across the board, with EVGA following Asus’s lead by &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/products/productlist.aspx?type=0&amp;amp;family=GeForce+30+Series+Family"&gt;openly admitting at the top of its website&lt;/a&gt; that it’s making these adjustments. Zotac, on the other hand, appears to have quietly raised prices not once, but twice in recent weeks — and thanks to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we can show you how both company’s prices have changed (at their own stores, anyhow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bTWCnh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/products/productlist.aspx?type=0&amp;amp;family=GeForce+30+Series+Family"&gt;Current EVGA prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uBbgIn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201120182414/https://www.evga.com/products/productlist.aspx?type=0&amp;amp;family=GeForce+30+Series+Family"&gt;Previous EVGA prices (November 20th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EByd2a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zotacstore.com/us/graphics-cards/geforce-rtx-30-series"&gt;Current Zotac prices &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="txD6Ai"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103220750/https://www.zotacstore.com/us/"&gt;Previous Zotac prices (January 3rd)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Df9q7y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201218011510/https://www.zotacstore.com/us/graphics-cards/geforce-rtx-30-series"&gt;Previous Zotac prices (December 18th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4tgbLM"&gt;Here’s EVGA’s statement, just for posterity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WFNsqS"&gt;Due to ongoing events, EVGA has made price adjustments on the GeForce RTX 30 Series products. This change was necessary due to several factors and will be effective January 11, 2021. EVGA has worked to reduce and minimize these costs as much as possible. For those who are currently in the EVGA.com Notify Queue system or Step-Up Queue, EVGA will honor the original MSRP pricing through April 16th, 2021 if your purchase position is processed before this date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TY6o45"&gt;Like EVGA suggests, its price hikes aren’t that drastic — only a $70 increase on most cards, and it’s nice that they’re honoring their trade-up program for a few months. The RTX 3060 Ti is just $460, the same a friend of mine recently paid at a Central Computers store for that exact card in the SF Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0ESnwt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10281420"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6NnYY"&gt;Zotac, on the other hand, has raised the price of even its most basic cards by $90-$100, and far more than that for the RTX 3090: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fGPoK2"&gt;from $440 to $500 and now $530 for an RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DTAcvX"&gt;from $540 to $600 and now $640 for an RTX 3070&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GnT2HI"&gt;from $750 to $780 and now $840 for an RTX 3080&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sSfUXi"&gt;from $1550 to $1580 and now $1900 for an RTX 3090&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="fUVbxd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10281428"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xV2cGk"&gt;None of this matters unless you can find one, of course. For that, again, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;here’s the latest guidance we have from AMD and Nvidia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube deletes Trump video and suspends new uploads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Addresses Protesters In D.C. Via Video Statement" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTw6ygpH_9tv0WhCLhmaP3rrY_g=/0x1:5636x3758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659544/1230456036.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Joshua Roberts/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Ciqck"&gt;YouTube has removed a new video uploaded to President Trump’s account for violating the company’s content policies on inciting violence. The account has also been issued a “strike” and is unable to upload new content for at least a week. It’s presently unclear exactly which video prompted the action on Trump’s account, or what the offending material was. YouTube declined to provide specific details on the video’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxvsBW"&gt;“After careful review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel and issued a strike for violating our policies for inciting violence.” YouTube says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result, in accordance with our long-standing strikes system, the channel is now prevented from uploading new videos or livestreams for a minimum of seven days — which may be extended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bF7l8u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube is also disabling comments on the channel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yp5NgS"&gt;YouTube also removed content from the White House’s official channel. Two videos that were on the White House’s official YouTube page earlier today — one where Trump was speaking to reporters, and another where he was making remarks at the border wall — have since been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJuZ9m"&gt;YouTube is also indefinitely disabling comments on Trump’s videos due to “ongoing concerns about violence,” which it says it’s done in the past to other channels with “safety concerns found in the comments section.” A second strike on the account would incur another mandatory two-week suspension, while a third strike would result in a permanent ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ToOi2"&gt;Previously, YouTube removed one of Trump’s videos that addressed a mob attack on the Capitol and also contained widespread misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;about the election results&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube instituted a new policy in December prohibiting content of any kind designed to spread misinformation about the outcome of the 2020 election by promoting false theories about fraudulent votes or other unverified claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzwiKc"&gt;YouTube isn’t the only company taking a harsher stance against President Trump after yesterday’s attack and in the lead up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned the president outright&lt;/a&gt; last week. Facebook initially prevented Trump from posting to Facebook and Instagram for 24 hours, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced even stricter measures&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning that include indefinitely suspending his account for at least the next weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Authorities have taken down the dark web’s largest illegal marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKm3-a3-U7K4V4aN_iRuRTwMEGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68659053/acastro_170621_1777_0006_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pz8ozm"&gt;DarkMarket, reportedly the world’s largest dark web marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/darkmarket-worlds-largest-illegal-dark-web-marketplace-taken-down"&gt;has been taken offline&lt;/a&gt; by a Europol-coordinated international operation, according to authorities (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-internets-biggest-darknet-just-got-taken-down-1846044148"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; German law enforcement arrested the Australian man believed to be the operator of the illegal site, and seized 20 servers that hosted it, bringing an end to what had become a hotbed of illegal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEFkd4"&gt;Before its closure, DarkMarket hosted close to 500,000 users and had facilitated over 320,000 transactions, according to Europol. The dark web marketplace traded everything from drugs and counterfeit money to stolen credit card details and malware. Per Europol’s estimate, the site traded the equivalent of €140 million in today’s money, in a mix of bitcoin and monero. European authorities plan to use seized DarkMarket servers from Ukraine and Moldova to investigate the buyers and sellers who used the site for criminal transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXIW8G"&gt;DarkMarket was uncovered as part of a larger investigation into web-hosting company Cyberbunker, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/13/australian-man-arrested-in-germany-over-worlds-largest-darknet-marketplace"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Cyberbunker (which is actually located in a former NATO bunker) housed servers for both The Pirate Bay and WikiLeaks in the past, and if this DarkMarket case is any example, seems to be a valuable starting point for future investigations into other illegal sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcE0ZR"&gt;The last several years have seen a vise-like grip tighten around dark internet venues like DarkMarket. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/3/18528211/wall-street-market-silkkitie-valhalla-dark-web-takedown-police-germany"&gt;Wall Street Market&lt;/a&gt;, another dark web marketplace, met a similar end in 2020 during a European investigation and other sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403362/empire-market-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road-alphabay"&gt;like Empire Market&lt;/a&gt; have disappeared entirely, whether out of fear of prosecution or the operators cutting their losses and taking the money. Whatever advantage sites like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15975140/alphabay-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road"&gt;Alphabay&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/2/4794780/fbi-seizes-underground-drug-market-silk-road-owner-indicted-in-new"&gt;The Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; had years ago seems to have disappeared as government agencies have gotten more aggressive in hunting down these marketplaces and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18226718/alphabay-takedown-drug-marketplace-federal-arrest"&gt;more capable of understanding how they work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The report comes in the wake of the social network’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;near-complete removal from the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, and is a good read for anyone who’s been following the story. The reporters, Dell Cameron and Dhruv Mehrotra, had to sift through tons of posts to build a map of the riot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YMnG5x"&gt;Gizmodo has mapped nearly 70,000 geo-located Parler posts and on Tuesday isolated hundreds published on January 6 near the Capitol where a mob of pro-Trump supporters had hoped to overturn a democratic election and keep their president in power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RCOHeB"&gt;When Parler went down, a researcher was able to exploit &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-hack-data-public-posts-images-video/"&gt;some terrible security practices&lt;/a&gt; to download almost all its data — including videos that contained tagged GPS locations. This is how &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; tracked the mob’s movement: from a Trump rally held earlier in the day to, eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;inside the nation’s Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COijLr"&gt;Since the Capitol riot, almost every company that Parler works with has dropped them as a client, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon, which hosted the site’s data&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which hosted the app on their stores. The companies banned the site because of claims that it held calls for violence against the US government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTNSY7"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo’s&lt;/em&gt; report doesn’t show how wide-spread the problem was on the site, it certainly shows that that Parler was actively used by people who took place in the attack. It goes into detail about what the mob did, and how the GPS data shows certain moments that have been burned into many of our memories, so &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991"&gt;it’s well worth the read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia and AMD address the great GPU shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If9npGXS6maQ24zBKQaJBcPMTPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658906/shollister_201117_4303_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WdhVgK"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti and 3090 and the AMD RX 6800 and 6800 XT are all incredibly hard to find, selling out instantly whenever they appear, due to an incredible level of demand that makes these GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;worth many hundreds of dollars more than MSRP&lt;/a&gt;. A Trump tax and surging cryptocurrency prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;may be about to make them even more expensive, too&lt;/a&gt;. Many older graphics cards are sold out online as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XspOJm"&gt;This week, Nvidia and AMD finally have some updates — and it’s bittersweet news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8ryaZ"&gt;On the plus side, AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it expects to sell more of its own reference design RX 6800, 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT cards on its own website in the first quarter of 2021 at their sticker prices, which should mean $579, $649 and $999 instead of inflated ones. But AMD is only committing to make them available “to as many gamers as possible,” which may not reassure buyers &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-radeon-rx-6800-cards-sell-out-instantly-sparking-cries-of-paper-launch"&gt;who felt AMD had a paper launch to begin with&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GnCLw"&gt;Nvidia, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398578-nvidia-corporation-nvda-presents-19th-annual-j-p-morgan-tech-auto-forum-conference-transcript"&gt;is now saying&lt;/a&gt; that supplies of its GPUs to both consumers and partners  “will likely remain lean through Q1,” and we’re not even talking about the first quarter of the year — Nvidia’s fiscal Q1 doesn’t end&lt;em&gt; until late April&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;That’s an awfully long wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ewaPiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The true price of a PlayStation 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g0Fq6r"&gt;Again, it’s demand, not just supply constraints, that are keeping graphics cards out of our hands. Nvidia tells us that since launch, its $499-and-up RTX 30-series GPUs have sold almost twice as much as the RTX 20-series did after the same amount of time. (The RTX 30-series is a much bigger upgrade than the previous gen was, mind you — there weren’t a lot of games that took advantage of Nvidia’s ray tracing at the time, and people’s GTX 10-series cards were still holding up just fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPvvEd"&gt;Nvidia does at least seem to think crypto miners aren’t snapping up all the cards quite yet, despite the sky-high prices we’ve recently seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UYmew"&gt;“If crypto demand begins or if we see a meaningful amount,” said CFO Colette Kress &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398578-nvidia-corporation-nvda-presents-19th-annual-j-p-morgan-tech-auto-forum-conference-transcript"&gt;at a recent investor conference&lt;/a&gt;, “we can also use that opportunity to restart the CMP product line to address ongoing mining demand.” CMP refers to Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/GV-NP106D5-6G-rev-11-12-13"&gt;dedicated crypto mining GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, which strip away the video ports miners don’t need because they aren’t driving graphics to a monitor, making them them more profitable for Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5ppHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only Asus has admitted to higher GPU prices so far&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uB41J"&gt;As far as whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;Trump’s taxes&lt;/a&gt; might impact the price of graphics cards, Nvidia isn’t saying much — but AMD CEO Lisa Su claims the company is trying its best to keep prices down. Here’s a quote &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc"&gt;transcribed by AnandTech&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uPYXzN"&gt;We knew about the expiration of some tariff policies, and in advance worked towards a more flexible supply chain as it relates to AMD. We are committed to keeping GPU pricing as close to our suggested retail pricing as much as possible, because it’s the only way to be fair to the users. Normally when we have GPU launches, our own branded cards are available initially but then fade away for our partners to pick up. This time around we’re not phasing out our RX 6000 series, enabling us to sell direct to customers as low as possible. We’re encouraging partners to do the same. Not only tariffs, but the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xfrMLa"&gt;That sounds good, but it’s still fairly noncommittal — and feels like a step back from &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-expects-aibs-to-sell-radeon-rx-6800-series-at-msrp-in-4-to-8-weeks"&gt;what AMD told &lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; in November&lt;/a&gt;, about how partners should be able to sell the RX 6800 XT at its original $649 MSRP within eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IA4R40"&gt;During their back-to-back CES 2021 keynotes today, AMD praised how its new graphics cards gave the company “leadership at the high end” and noted that “many gamers are excited about the Radeon RX 6000 series,” while Nvidia acknowledged that “these products have been hard to find, and we want to thank you for your patience as we continue to work hard to catch up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDN4uG"&gt;It’s going to be a wait, and you shouldn’t be surprised if Nvidia’s just-announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;$329 GeForce RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; is hell to buy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/10/29/21539965/nvidia-rtx-3070-preorders-sold-out-micro-center-best-buy-newegg"&gt;just like its predecessors&lt;/a&gt;. Like many have asked: why can’t we just buy one and they ship it when it’s ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IaPQPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The gaming industry keeps failing miserably at selling its most important products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ushZvs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:48 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added AMD CEO Lisa Su’s thoughts on Trump’s tariffs and pricing, thanks to AnandTech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 Ultra may be the next big gadget to come in brown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_w7UJ-kedwkqSE56U1tVZV7bxE=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658892/ErjR_QYXcAMdE1r.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtPDA9"&gt;Samsung’s next top-of-the-line smartphone may come in brown, according to leaked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt; of the entire Galaxy S21 lineup shared by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; writer Roland Quandt, and I have to say that it’s giving me some &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/fond-memories-microsoft-zune-brown/"&gt;serious Microsoft Zune vibes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULPFtC"&gt;The phone won’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; come in brown, though — it appears there are five colors planned for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, including that brown, and you can see all of them at the top of this post and pictured below. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DazcvkXo4koT1qgPJigV-Oc21_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231665/ErjQbLTXUAI_3Ww.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another render of the S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7Zd81"&gt;Other notable phones have been brown-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;. I’d argue that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017"&gt;the gold iPhone 8’s aluminum&lt;/a&gt; could look like a very light brown in the right light, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17871816/apple-iphone-xs-max-review-camera-processor-battery-price"&gt;gold iPhone XS’s back&lt;/a&gt; has some brown tones. Samsung edged toward brown with the “Mystic Bronze” color offered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333566/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-announced-price-release-date-1449-99"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; (though that color also has a lot of pink, in my eyes). But unlike those recent iPhones and Samsung phones, the S21 Ultra’s brown can’t be mistaken for a gold or a bronze — it’s a dark, earthy brown, and I kinda like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPxMv3"&gt;Samsung is also expected to announce two versions of the non-Ultra S21: the Galaxy S21 and a larger Galaxy S21 Plus. Each of those models will come in slightly different sets of colors, based on the renders shared by Quandt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5NV8v"&gt;The S21 may come in four colors, including a white and a lighter black that seem to be S21 exclusives. (The white is my personal favorite of all of the phones.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uH4_b0-BxkKAXXq6tJ1jU_wG700=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231619/ErjR_QcXIAQxpu3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ElYPMH"&gt;And it seems the larger S21 Plus could come in five colors, including a vibrant red, a darker black, and a blue-ish white that appear to be exclusive to the S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it5FRQ3b2AXEL7gtf2AG_SR1K-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231623/ErjQbLVXIAIUOju.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dKvgWj"&gt;Colors aren’t the only things that have leaked about the S21 lineup, though — we’ve rounded up everything else we think we know about the phones (and a couple other products Samsung may announce on Thursday) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glI2Az"&gt;Samsung’s next Unpacked event kicks off Thursday morning at 10AM ET, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will be covering all of the news from the show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this NYT story about losing $220 million in bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bitcoin strength in numbers 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bm1P_8jADe9zYCrvuv7ATOvifL0=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658418/20130520-07511828--btc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZYsYyB"&gt;There aren’t many good ways to lose $220 million, but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; highlights a particularly egregious one — losing millions of dollars in bitcoin because you forgot the password to your digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZMyTe"&gt;Stefan Thomas’ 7,002 bitcoin (worth roughly $220 million) are locked away in an IronKey hard drive, according to &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s Nathaniel Popper. The problem is he can’t remember the password, and he’s just two failed password attempts closer to losing them forever due to IronKey’s strict security protocols. There is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1348999856111591424"&gt;the possibility of paying someone to crack the drive&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas would have to have the time and money to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFzWFX"&gt;It’s a darkly comedic scenario, and Popper’s story hits all of the cryptocurrency classics to help explain it. There’s mention of the volatile nature of bitcoin’s value and the currency’s mysterious creator, but what the article makes staggeringly clear is how common losing bitcoin actually is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5sn9X"&gt;Two other people get singled out in Thomas’ story of woe, but it’s a surprisingly common tale. Of the 18.5 million bitcoin currently in existence, roughly 20 percent (around $140 billion) are lost in inaccessible wallets, Popper writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmPE0y"&gt;There have been other high-value wallets locked out in the past, with contents ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/"&gt;$30,000&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/quest-to-liberate-bitcoin-from-old-zip-file/"&gt;$300,000&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas’ story is a reminder of how persistent this problem is among bitcoin users and how expensive it has become. The secure and decentralized nature of bitcoin is great — until it collides with simple human forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xgGmb"&gt;You can read the whole story &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and appreciate just how much &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude"&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/a&gt; bitcoin continues to generate.&lt;/p&gt;
