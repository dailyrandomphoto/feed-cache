    <title>CES 2022 will close a day early because of COVID concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJng5S0iChVrOuaRcv-whEF9uDg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334726/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3M40f"&gt;CES has dropped the last day of its 2022 tech conference in Las Vegas, and the show will now end on January 7th, the Consumer Technology Association announced today. The shorter schedule is “an additional safety measure” in the face of a surge of COVID-19 diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFgIXC"&gt;Over the last two weeks, a number of large companies — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22853157/ces-microsoft-canceled-omicron-covid"&gt;Microsoft &lt;/a&gt;and the company formerly known as Facebook — have dropped their physical presences at the conference. It’s the largest tech conference in the world, which typically pulls more than 10,000 people in each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s558Kt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CTA’s president and CEO has said the show “will and must go on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL08Yd"&gt;Yesterday the US set a grim new record in COVID: &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/us/coronavirus-cases-high.html"&gt;the highest number of infections reported daily&lt;/a&gt; — breaking a record set the day before. Las Vegas is located in Clark County, Nevada, &lt;a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/health/coronavirus-health/new-clark-county-reports-5th-highest-cases-in-pandemic-test-positivity-climbs-to-11-1/"&gt;where 11 percent of COVID tests&lt;/a&gt; are returning positive results. &lt;a href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/"&gt;Nevada’s COVID tracker&lt;/a&gt; flags Clark County as an area of elevated disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vh7JtV"&gt;More than 2,200 exhibitors are confirmed-in person for CES, the CTA said in its emailed statement. As exhibitors have curtailed their trips to Las Vegas, the CTA’s president and CEO, Gary Shapiro, has &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;said the show&lt;/a&gt; “will and must go on.” In today’s announcement, the CTA said that 143 companies have signed up for in-person exhibits in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7VzBk"&gt;Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination to get their badges. The CTA has also requested that they test for COVID-19 less than 24 hours before entering the conference, and will be giving away free rapid tests to help with that. Masks will be required for the show, and international travelers will get a free PCR test after the show ends.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration will continue ISS cooperation through 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EIXjqD02Z9p6qAbHTPKhrfeAm0w=/35x0:1565x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334637/1600px_International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS_132.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlzW2W"&gt;The US will continue to work with other countries’ space programs on the International Space Station through 2030, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/"&gt;NASA announced today&lt;/a&gt;. That will allow for an uninterrupted transition to a planned commercial space station (or stations!) in the late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX7v9"&gt;Funds for the ISS have already been approved through 2024. NASA administrator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440208/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson-interview-rockets-moon-plans-partnerships"&gt;Bill Nelson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in May &lt;/a&gt;that he wants to continue work on the ISS through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJ6cTZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ISS’s future was called into question in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0thkP"&gt;The ISS’s future was called into question in 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930154/nasa-international-space-station-president-trump-budget-request-2025"&gt;a draft budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; from President Donald Trump’s administration had scheduled ending support for the space station in 2025. More recently, escalating tensions between the US and Russia have threatened the cooperation required to work together on the ISS. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia blew up a satellite&lt;/a&gt;, creating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791176/russia-asat-satellite-test-space-debris-visualizations"&gt;dangerous debris cloud&lt;/a&gt; in Earth’s orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09NFEW"&gt;“It’s more important than ever that the United States continues to lead the world in growing international alliances and modeling rules and norms for the peaceful and responsible use of space,” Nelson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC0YbA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colorado fires close out a year of disastrous drought</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wildland fire in Boulder county burning hundreds of structures." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijy_Tryt537YB_uOCe7LO6SUJnE=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334517/1362041399.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fires continue to burn into the evening in neighborhoods on December 30, 2021 in Louisville, Colorado. | Photo by Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXt3Pq"&gt;Devastating fires in Colorado cap off a year of awful drought across the US. Dry conditions helped set the stage for blazes that scorched hundreds of homes and forced tens of thousands to evacuate just ahead of New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rFml3"&gt;The fires have been raging through suburbs near Denver since December 30th. Strong winds fanned the flames and knocked out power. About 6,000 acres and at least 500 homes had burned by Friday morning. But there were no casualties, which Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle called “miraculous” given the severity of the fire in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=310406430998077"&gt;press briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Families had “minutes” to evacuate their homes, Governor Jared Polis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzMqMX"&gt;More than two-thirds of Colorado’s land is experiencing “severe” drought, according to the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Officials &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/31/us/colorado-wildfires.html"&gt;suspect&lt;/a&gt; that downed power lines might have sparked the inferno, a problem that becomes more dangerous when a dry landscape provides plenty of tinder.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W1RWuk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;One of the many factors that lead to the devastating wildfire today is the recent record dryness. For all periods from Jul 1st to Dec 29th (essentially the second half of the year), Denver has been the driest on record by over an inch. Snowfall is at record low levels, too. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8OriOBPyTs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8OriOBPyTs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NWS Boulder (@NWSBoulder) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBoulder/status/1476803594196193280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxMh5i"&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; a particularly bad fire season this year. The potential for “significant fire activity” was “above normal” for nearly all of the West at some point this year, according to a February &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;outlook&lt;/a&gt; from the National Interagency Fire Center. By the end of the year, more than &lt;a href="https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn"&gt;7.8 million acres&lt;/a&gt; burned across the US — five percent more than the 10-year average of 7.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQw115"&gt;What’s typical for the US is changing because of the climate crisis. Severe fires have become &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL089858"&gt;much more frequent&lt;/a&gt; in the western US over the past few decades with hotter, drier seasons. On top of that, fire season — which used to run roughly from May to November — &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/27/wildfires-all-seasons"&gt;no longer seems to let up&lt;/a&gt;. Colorado’s blazes illustrate this, coming unusually late in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VHj7iG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What’s typical for the US is changing because of the climate crisis. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBFBBp"&gt;The fires in Colorado are just one catastrophic symptom of drought across the US. The Colorado River, a lifeline for 25 million people who rely on it for water, faced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;unprecedented water shortage&lt;/a&gt; this year. An official shortage was declared for the first time at the US’ largest reservoir, Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, in August. Water levels at the reservoir dipped to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;historic low&lt;/a&gt; in June. Mandatory &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/#/news-release/3950"&gt;water cuts&lt;/a&gt; will kick in for Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico starting January 1st. Arizona will face the steepest cuts, which are expected to hit farmers the hardest. In California, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;drought cut into the state’s available hydroelectricity&lt;/a&gt; — putting even more stress on a power grid that’s struggled to keep the lights on for many residents whenever fire weather picks up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK85rq"&gt;Heavy rain and record snow are now closing out the year in California. That’s been somewhat helpful in easing water shortages, but it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/california-record-snowfall-drought"&gt;not enough&lt;/a&gt; to end the drought. Climate change, no surprise, is behind the rise in extreme weather swings. It intensifies the world’s water cycle, says a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;landmark climate repor&lt;/a&gt;t published this year. So we’ll probably want to brace for another wild weather year in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A program for cheaper internet for low-income Americans launches today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Virtually Meets With Local Officials To Discuss Infrastructure Investment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8n1930TMIN_kI37BUWupF-GbGEU=/0x2:7654x5105/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333952/1333633935.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. President Joe Biden participates in a virtual meeting on Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act at South Court Auditorium at Eisenhower Executive Office Building August 11, 2021 in Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JsWfht"&gt;Starting today, eligible US residents can apply for help with their internet bills under the new &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/acp"&gt;Affordable Connectivity Program&lt;/a&gt;. The program &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-affordable-connectivity-program"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; today with $14.2 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure law passed in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9Ab0r"&gt;Households can apply to take up to $30 a month off their internet service bill. For households on &lt;a href="https://acpbenefit.org/do-i-qualify/enhanced-tribal-benefit/"&gt;qualifying Tribal lands,&lt;/a&gt; the discount is up to $75 per month. The program could help to connect millions of people to the internet who haven’t had access to it at home, especially in communities that have historically faced more barriers to getting online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFVbD"&gt;Almost a third of people living on Tribal lands lacked high-speed internet at home in 2017, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41134-020-00147-9"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). That’s compared to just 1.5 percent of city-dwellers without high-speed internet access. On top of limited infrastructure, cost is often another barrier. The United States has the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;second-highest&lt;/a&gt; broadband costs out of &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/broadband/broadband-statistics-update.htm"&gt;35 countries&lt;/a&gt; studied by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And American Indian and Alaska Native people have the highest poverty rate of any race group in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2017/aian-month.html"&gt;according to the US Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5OgT4i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To even apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program, someone has to be able to get online.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB0XjQ"&gt;To even apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program, someone has to be able to get online. They’ll need to visit &lt;a href="http://acpbenefit.org/"&gt;ACPBenefit.org&lt;/a&gt; to apply or print out a mail-in application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiuOXZ"&gt;Folks eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program can also qualify for a one-time $100 discount for a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer from &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-broadband-benefit-providers"&gt;participating providers&lt;/a&gt; (including T-Mobil, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yym18z"&gt;The Affordable Connectivity Program is basically a long-term replacement of the temporary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302807/fcc-internet-subsidies-authorized-low-income-broadband"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; started to help Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. That program offered a higher discount of $50 a month for households &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; living on Tribal lands, and will continue until &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit"&gt;March 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRTAFh"&gt;While the payout will be lower for some households, the FCC &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://acpbenefit.org/do-i-qualify/"&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt; for who can apply. Being eligible for &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic"&gt;WIC&lt;/a&gt; (the food assistance program for women, infants, and children) now also makes a household eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program. And a household with an income that’s at or below 200 percent of &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines"&gt;federal poverty guidelines&lt;/a&gt; is also newly eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYDUuE"&gt;There’s more funding on the way to close the digital divide in the US. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;$1 trillion infrastructure law&lt;/a&gt; includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;$65 billion&lt;/a&gt; to boost broadband access. More than 30 million Americans live somewhere without adequate broadband infrastructure, according to a Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The governor of Missouri still doesn’t know how websites work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Missouri Gov. Mike Parson Holds Press Conference On Planned Parenthood License" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wBHz_x730cyzplncgR1GkmEmICk=/0x0:3326x2217/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333854/1146875721.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jacob Moscovitch/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQd1Uj"&gt;Mike Parson, Governor of Missouri, does not understand how websites work. He held a press conference earlier this week in St. Louis to once more reiterate his desire to prosecute a &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; journalist for looking at the source code of a state-run website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVG4vC"&gt;In October 2021 reporter Josh Renaud &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agency-s-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html"&gt;reported that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website source code had exposed the social security numbers of over 100,000 school teachers, administrators, and counselors&lt;/a&gt;. He published the story only after he’d reported the problem to the state and the vulnerability had been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx8hFA"&gt;Parson and the DESE were apparently not grateful for the alert and immediately accused Renaud of “hacking” the DESE website. Missouri Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven sent a letter to educators saying “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGvmdk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-planned-to-thank-post-dispatch-before-threatening-newspaper-emails-show/article_0f6c5288-cd11-569c-804e-9b280e9c1e68.html"&gt;According to records obtained by the &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the FBI told the state the website had been “misconfigured” and that Renaud’s actions were “not an actual network intrusion”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs7zFG"&gt;The source code was not encrypted. A website’s source code is typically available to anyone using a web browser. While scraping it requires some technical knowledge, just looking at it is as simple as opening the “Developer Tools” option available in nearly every web browser, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. If you want, you can go look at The Verge’s source code right now. By the logic of Parson and the DESE anyone who uses the Developer Tools on a website they don’t own is a hacker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpyI8t"&gt;In fact...gimme a second....boom, I just hacked Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7f2bc"&gt;While a gross misunderstanding of how websites work by both a state agency and the governor of said state might be funny, Governor Parson's behavior since the paper first published its story is anything but. According to public records obtained by the &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-planned-to-thank-post-dispatch-before-threatening-newspaper-emails-show/article_0f6c5288-cd11-569c-804e-9b280e9c1e68.html"&gt;Vandeven had initially planned to thank the paper for finding the vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. Her tone only became accusatory after meeting with the governor’s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOdxMT"&gt;The Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose superintendent is appointed by the governor, initiated a probe into the newspaper’s story. They turned the case over to Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson on Monday, December 27. Governor Parson then held a press conference on Wednesday, December 29, where he cited a &lt;a href="https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=569.095"&gt;state statute&lt;/a&gt; related to computer tampering and repeatedly suggested Thompson should use it to prosecute Renaud and the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Qgwd"&gt;In the press conference, he compared Renaud’s actions to a person using a lock pick to enter a person’s home without permission. Which is in no way an appropriate analogy. Websites are public-facing. They’re akin to public buildings, not homes. A more apt analogy would be if a person is in a state-owned building and walks by a locked room, and sees someone posted a bunch of sensitive information in the window for anyone to see, regardless of whether or not they have keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qSjFt"&gt;Personally, I would want someone to knock on the door and point out the problem without fear of prosecution by an embarrassed man with no grasp of how websites work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest iPad is back down to its best price at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vo2gOGGE1IGPtSgWHuNEjeLfYdg=/0x0:1653x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333568/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Connect_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This year’s entry-level iPad is currently on sale at Amazon for $299.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0vvdG"&gt;It’s New Year’s Eve, and while that means we are very soon waving goodbye (and good riddance) to the year 2021, it just wouldn’t be special enough day without a selection of great tech deals from your friends at &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals. &lt;/em&gt;This has certainly been a jam-packed year full of, well, chaos, but also some great gadgets and worthwhile savings that help you save some coin along the way. While we can’t wait to bring you even more in 2022, let’s not get ahead of ourselves too quickly. Below, we’ll highlight some of the best deals for you in the world of tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeSa8V"&gt;Starting us off, there is no better bang-for-the-buck tablet on the market for most people than Apple’s latest base-model iPad. The 10.2-inch model mostly stands alone in terms of the price-to-performance ratio while also having such an expansive ecosystem of apps, accessory compatibility, and long-lasting support via software updates. Whether it’s mostly a Netflix-machine for your family or the main homework tool for a child, the base iPad is a workhorse that easily sells at its $329 entry price point. That is probably why we have seen such infrequent discounts this year, though we are now in luck. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the base 64GB Wi-Fi configuration for $299&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $30. If you’re in need of more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91TLNJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model has the same discount, knocking it down to $449&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAij75"&gt;While the latest iPad looks nearly the same as most models before it, its updated A13 Bionic CPU is much faster than its predecessor. Also, its front-facing camera now has Center Stage, to automatically follow you in the frame during video calls. How perfect, since it seems like our Zoom-centric ways will not change just yet for early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j1ogx2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="buw3it"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V30cJd"&gt;Looking for a little more than Apple’s entry-level offerings? The iPad Air is the mid-range option in Apple’s lineup — sitting well above the base model, but less costly than the iPad Pro options — and for many people it’s the Goldilocks of being “just right” in terms of power and features. The iPad Air features a speedy A14 Bionic processor and Touch ID fingerprint sensor combined with a 10.9-inch screen in a fairly compact footprint. It has all of the looks of the Pro models without the same heft in price. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229396/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F650223175&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today, you can get it from Walmart for just $539&lt;/a&gt;, which is $60 off its usual price of $599 for this base configuration with 64GB of storage and Wi-Fi radio. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1HOa9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"10 Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22815442/iphone-ipad-best-games-apple-arcade-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="79C9uF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lhwc1R"&gt;You’ve probably already heard plenty of “new year, new you” hyperbole, and unfortunately, that will continue to ring out well into January and February, but here’s a resolution you might have not considered: get better lighting. If you’re working from home or just spending a lot of time at your place during the long and dreary winter months, lighting can be a robust mood-enhancer. Nanoleaf’s Elements line of illuminated wood-look panels can brighten up a workspace and give a touch of warmth to an otherwise humdrum room. You can choose your desired pattern layout when you mount them, and customize the glowing effects to suit your vibe or mindset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV3JUA"&gt;Nanoleaf has been &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F31%2F22859709%2Fapple-ipad-air-tablet-nanoleaf-lighting-elements-shapes-sennheiser-momentum-headphones-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;running some great discounts across a variety of its products&lt;/a&gt;, though the Elements are our choice for the best deal around. You can get the a seven-panel starter kit direct from Nanoleaf or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjH49H9ggf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $70 off, bringing them to their all-time low price of $229.99. For additional coverage, a three-panel kit is $20 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjH54PK564" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; as well. Though time is running out on this deal, as it’s set to expire on New Year’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rSun4H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771267"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4zEcn1"&gt;Ready to close out 2021 strong? Here’s an idea. Get a great pair of noise-canceling headphones, and block out the rest of the world for a little while. I think that’s what most of us want to do with 2021, and let’s be honest, we owe it to ourselves. The Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones are tied for fourth place in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our list of best headphones for 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but they are without a doubt one of the most unique looking sets you can buy that back up good looks with quality sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs2tuI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the Momentum 3 Wireless in white for just $217.13&lt;/a&gt;, saving a whopping $182 off MSRP. These are an excellent set of headphones with a punchy sound, and they’re back down to their all-time low price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H9n6fK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3P8JqD"&gt;More deals that still won’t help you recall the words to &lt;em&gt;Auld Lang Syne&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k9zAht"&gt;If you need some speedy external storage for a phone, tablet, drone, or Nintendo Switch, a Lexar 256GB 1066x microSD card is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GGCMT2Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$32.99 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($27 off).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dhzLq"&gt;Logitech’s G335 wired headset could be described as an affordable, no-frills gaming headset, but it’s got some vibrant stylings to accompany its affordable price. The black model is just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KKBSDTY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$48.23 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (about $22 off). The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KKW2ZS2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KKZ8S36?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; colorways are $49.99 each, and all of them feature colorful accents and a mic that mutes when you flip it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>2021: A year in art on The Verge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfftiB6_FVHrvodMr3nDUcg4EZQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333543/VRG_ILLO_4948_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iX6fn9"&gt;As we near the end of 2021, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s art team looked back on the past year to reflect on some of our favorite pieces. Our team produced a wide range of original art: from captivating photography of the future of energy, to illustrations representing the last 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for our anniversary issue, to dozens of stunning shots for our reviews, to a photo shoot of a lot of chicken wings. Below is a selection of our best photography and illustration from our reviews, special issues, gift guides, features, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksP6nUhxnoFCXbqSq0VHMd1gCWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134777/Verge_10.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Fol5J3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753021/verge-10"&gt;Verge 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n8dD3F"&gt;Illustration by Micha Huigen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSyAqN"&gt;To mark ten years of publishing at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we looked back on a decade of tech coverage and examined what might come next. Micha Huigen’s art distills this intersection into a single image that resists confining itself to one space. An interlinked canvas of 25 editorial illustrations, which represent all the features in our Verge 10 package, links together into a seamless infinite grid. His surreal illustrations function like scenescapes within which we get to explore close-ups of tiny modular worlds and expansive reimagined realities at once, maintaining a rare analog quality that suggests DIY lithography. (Also, I’m not going to shut up about how we need to wallpaper the whole office in this.) — Kristen Radtke, art director&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_E1fb_5NdAj4we0wPlEdxJALS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773279/VRG_4688_001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cshslb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617287/daversa-executive-recruiting-partner-allegations-workplace-harassment"&gt;No adults in the room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh4ZBZ"&gt;Illustration by William Joel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYZS5A"&gt;For the lead art, I wanted to find a way to show someone in a situation where they were overwhelmed by the number of inappropriate texts and “flags” while being left helpless by those in a position to do something about it. My initial idea was to make a trail of texts leading the reader on to an ominous ending, but ultimately that didn’t feel strong for the lead art. Instead, I pivoted to a more literal interpretation of being overwhelmed — in this case, drowning in the texts. — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="hwLRW1"&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro and Grayson Blackmon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYAtbo"&gt;This art by Alex Castro and Grayson Blackmon, art directed by Will Joel, speaks to the stalled nature of life during the pandemic so well: traffic lights forever blinking yellow, crosswalks that never complete their countdown, and railroad crossing bars that remain permanently horizontal. The result creates a clear metaphor for the finger-drumming anxiety of the late-stage pandemic. — Kristen Radtke, art director&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrEZe5TB5SJLWz6kKMzDumow1QY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070981/acastro_211001_4790_0001.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p id="pjkxBz"&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vt8q0"&gt;Feature artwork for a story on EV startup Chanje. It’s a wild ride that takes the reader through international business drama to a tech CEO cult of personality dynamics. I particularly loved creating the spot illustrations, which were chances to show the wackiness of the story. I would explain more, but you just gotta read the piece; I can’t do it justice. — Alex Castro, illustrator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QHDimL"&gt;Photo illustrations by Alex Castro, Amelia Holowaty Krales, Grayson Blackmon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp2Nfz"&gt;Delivery-only “ghost kitchens” exploded during the pandemic, so we invented a bunch of our own for this story about virtual chicken wing brands. We repackaged wings that we purchased from ghost kitchens (plus a little extra sauce) to nod to the consumer deception and acknowledge the humor of it all. This was a collaborative effort of the entire art team — and the first opportunity to work together in person after over a year on Zoom. — Amelia Holowaty Krales, senior photo editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dH4Pfe"&gt;Illustrations by Tyler Comrie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmpGOj"&gt;Out of all the sketches Tyler shared, these resonated immediately. In part because it feels like doomscrolling — a constant in our lives thanks to COVID — but also because it felt so tied to the passive nature of people seeing some meme on a social feed and just believing it without any validation. That seems to be how so many of these lies spread so easily: there’s no fact-checking, just scrolling, ingesting, and... repeat. — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KvhENT"&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypThkP"&gt;To accompany a story about tech companies’ involvement with public health during the pandemic, this illustration by Alex Castro looks, on first glance, as though the health cross is being supported by the cables that suspend it. But upon closer inspection, the cables are plugged into the object’s unprotected areas, turning support into entrapment. I love everything Alex makes, and his art has become synonymous with the visual sensibility of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. — Kristen Radtke, art director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wSKI0R"&gt;I’ve admired Ori Toor’s bizarre and gorgeous illustrations for a long time, so I was thrilled when he came on board to draw the art for our security week package. The circular elements speak to each individual story, and while they’re each unique in their styling, they speak cohesively to each other just as well. I love to take an illustration apart in some way, pulling out elements and making them interactive. — Kristen Radtke, art director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GTXvil"&gt;This year’s suite of gift guides was the largest &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever done, so we turned to artist Richard Parry, who’s a master at creating expansive worlds. Each individual guide is represented by a single room, which build together into a neighborhood stuffed with oversized objects. The products are both whimsical and at home in their spaces — it almost seems natural to strap a surfboard that’s three times the size of a car to the roof of a sedan. — Kristen Radtke, art director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LFNpzL"&gt;This story was about the messy backend of Apple’s new podcast subscription feature. I wanted to communicate that what was broken underneath the surface ends up coming to light and impacting the user and creators.

&lt;p id="Ay9Hzc"&gt;A quick illustration that I love mainly due to its simplicity. Made for a piece on Spotify’s acquisition of an audiobook company, I wanted to construct waveforms using books — so after a few iterations, I focused on the Spotify logo, which in its own way reflects waveforms. I originally had the books more digitally stylized, but a note from our art director Kristen moved it into a more realistic space, which really sold it. — Alex Castro, illustrator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Q8JcFo"&gt;This is one of the first longform pieces I worked on since joining &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a story of how the technology industry evolved over the last decade — companies tangled over high-stakes lawsuits, powerful new figures reshaped how we communicate, companies rose and fell competing over slivers of market share. The illustrations that make up this story exemplify what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; does best: break down seemingly complicated information into digestible bits. — Kristen Radtke, art director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="higWiq"&gt;This was a big investigative feature from Zoe Schiffer about Apple’s company culture shifting from one of locked down secrecy to frequent open dissent. Now, more than ever, Apple employees felt empowered to stand up for themselves and their colleagues. This image came to mind very quickly when reading the piece. It was clear that Apple’s public image was held up by its employees, and it falls apart when they decide to make a change. A specific detail I wanted to show was people empowering others through their choices and employees considering what they’ll do next. — Alex Castro, illustrator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BjvzGB"&gt;Not long after leading AI researcher Timnit Gebru was fired from Google, she became the target of a campaign of harassing tweets. Gebru and others suspect that some of these came from sock puppet accounts. I wanted to illustrate a seemingly never-ending barrage of toxic tweets or messages from a single source. I tried making this completely in After Effects but wasn’t loving how the solitaire effect was looking, so I pivoted to using some JavaScript and then taking that animation back into After Effects to edit it to loop perfectly. — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="j66t8V"&gt;To accompany this excerpt from Tamara Shopsin’s novel about an early ‘90s Mac repair shop, we worked to create a visual metaphor for how the once cutting-edge LaserWriter II printer compressed images and text to produce clear prints. We represented this compression with rows of seeds that we meticulously affixed to transparent sheeting, arranging flowers at the opening of the output tray. We mimicked the color of the flowers with lighting and pulled the gradient through the page design to create a cohesive, playful package. Sourcing the 36-year-old printer was a challenge — the eBay seller seemed quite confused about why we wanted it so badly. Amelia set up eight lights with colorful gels, and the result is sexy and weird — the hardest part was figuring out how to get the contact paper to stick to the printer. — Amelia Holowaty Krales and Kristen Radtke&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iU9e3Q"&gt;This is an absolutely bonkers story literally about sex, drugs, and podcasting. A house rented in Beverly Hills meant to be a creative hub for podcasts was crushed under its weight and turned into a mismanaged party house. This story already had a great deal of strong visuals. Philip Cheung’s photography of Norm Steele is seriously stunning. Richard Vogel’s photos paint such a vivid picture of what a party at the house is like. We had decided early on we wanted an illustration, however, as the lead art. While we had the idea of showing the house falling apart, it took a few iterations and changing of hands to really capture the tone correctly. Ultimately, Alex Castro did such a fantastic job, especially with the additional illustrations in the body of the article. — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="H7qnSw"&gt;This piece brought together all the disappointments, duds, and flight risks of the decade. I decided to go with a low poly PS1 look to emphasize the low-quality nature of these products — and because it tends to look pretty funny. Initially only the Note 7 was going to be on fire, but that eventually spread to the whole dumpster. It became a dumpster fire, if you will. — Alex Castro, illustrator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="XhQ6SB"&gt;Illustration by William Joel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ouoF8"&gt;This report from Ashley Carman covers how difficult and nuanced it is to moderate podcasts, and how that is a growing issue for a number of companies. In particular, Apple seems to have taken a different approach than others by not removing some content. I wanted to make an image that simply illustrated toxic audio that was a growing issue. It’s not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion"&gt;first time I’ve turned to emoji&lt;/a&gt; in our art to try to sell a tone quickly, but given the connection to Apple with podcasts it made sense! — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lt9nNU"&gt;Illustration by William Joel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaJLvR"&gt;This feature from Sean Hollistor about app developer Kosta Eleftheriou finding scams in Apple’s App Store is a great and frustrating read. In it are many examples of scammy apps, like a call recorder app that charges $9.99 a week, doesn’t work, and users complain they can’t figure out to how unsubscribe from — but it also somehow has a great rating and review. The goal for the art was to simply illustrate an app store filled with “scams,” and my initial sketch of just making the App Store logo out of a skull emoji seemed to speak to the dangerous state of the platform. — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="U4QpBX"&gt;This was such a fantastic series to work on. I had the pleasure of working with the amazing Ari Liloan on these illustrations.

&lt;p id="zKlNO3"&gt;It might be obvious, but this one isn’t very deep: I read the line saying Schumer’s “goal is to have every car manufactured in America be electric by 2030,” and the idea to have the illustration be a bit extreme seemed obvious. That said, I am extremely happy with how this turned out. — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5VV1Qf"&gt;Illustrations by David Huang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVQnV8"&gt;David Huang is great at this kind of compilations of moments. He made this piece for our story on the biggest takeaways from emails made public during the Epic v. Apple trial. There’s no heavy central visual to the illustration, which is something I tend to have often in my work. This is something that challenged me when art directing, as I had to fight my impulse to bring everything together and allow things to sprawl out. David did an incredible job. — Alex Castro, illustrator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IsMHCM"&gt;Illustrations by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGDmXe"&gt;Another amazing project working with Maria Chimishkyan. For this project, we needed a style to use across a series of privacy-related stories and a landing page. Working with Chimishkyan, we landed on each illustration incorporating some type of data elements relating to each story, as well as a mix of expressive and UI-esque dimensional strokes or line work. That combined with her 3D style gave us a series of fantastic illustrations that feel both unique and themed to this series. — William Joel, creative director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="F7Nju5"&gt;This was for a story about AI researchers at Google being silenced when pointing out the wrongs of Google’s programs. The job they were hired to do was being sabotaged, leaving them confused and lost. I was inspired by M.C. Escher’s famous labyrinth drawings. I wanted to visualize the difficult task of navigating the internals of Google and the ethics they’ve sworn to uphold. Which way is up, which way is down? — Alex Castro, illustrator&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10 great games to play on your new VR headset </title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;The best games you can play on the Vive, Rift, or Quest 2&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Fa5jSJ"&gt;With the advent of platforms like the Oculus Quest 2, VR has never been more accessible. Setups that once required a massive commitment of time and resources — not to mention space — have become remarkably easy to use. While the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more popular options when it comes to VR headsets, we’ve included titles that use &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-PC/dp/B07B9WPR7G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HTC Vive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-SteamVR-Base-Station-2-0-pc/dp/B07VZSDF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Steam VR&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Rift-PC-Powered-Gaming-Headset-pc/dp/B07PTMKYS7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Rift&lt;/a&gt; headsets as well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60j5k1"&gt;Once you get past the fact that you’re going to look silly, no matter what game you’re playing, you’re bound to have a great time with our list of the best titles you can play with your VR headset of choice. While the majority of our top picks for this year are available on all VR headsets, there are some notable exceptions. If you’re wondering if a game will work with your particular headset, we’ve outlined that at the bottom of each entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6pwXP5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="b2saId"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Beat Saber" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h727d8sYIE0TGKWQ03fhkJuuGRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079439/ss_1881ae4f153faf0d1ccecca60fbdac5b43ad57eb.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beat Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AjjGRh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; features an existing library of free songs but also features songs from popular artists like Skrillex and Billie Eilish that are available for purchase individually or as part of a bundle. Furthermore, with a little bit of elbow grease, you can even add your own tunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fentj2"&gt;At a base level, &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; is relatively simple, having you cut through incoming cubes in specific directions to the rhythm of the song. However, like most rhythm games, &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; has a remarkably high skill ceiling, becoming downright relentless on the higher difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG55ZZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatible with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeGreatVRGames2021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2448060205267927&amp;amp;LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus Quest, Oculus Quest 2, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus Rift, HTC Vive Pro, Valve Index&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4882-CUSA12878_00-BEATSABERFULL000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayStation VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CgSMVf"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hRzn8m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dance Central VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dance Central VR" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHZQGVj7R4Q1RfELJWKTnt3s-Eg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079440/dance_central_screenshot_1.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dance Central VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TysZ8q"&gt;From the same house that brought us &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt;, Harmonix is a studio that knows how to make us look ridiculous in our living rooms while making us feel incredibly cool. &lt;em&gt;Dance Central VR&lt;/em&gt; is the logical evolution of this franchise that debuted on the Kinect, and anyone familiar with the classic &lt;em&gt;Dance Dance Revolution&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Just Dance&lt;/em&gt; titles will know what to expect here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="br3tzx"&gt;The game features 32 songs and several remixes that bridge eras and genres from ‘80s hip-hop to modern alternative. There are a dozen or so DLC songs available; however, the store is no longer receiving updates and there is presently no way to add your own, unlike &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQ1E5n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dance Central VR&lt;/em&gt; is by far the most active game on our list and even has a rudimentary built-in fitness tracking function that provides you with a rough estimate of how many calories you’ve burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp9zNs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatible with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeBestVRGames2021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Frift%2F1592992710742424&amp;amp;LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus Quest, Oculus Quest 2, Oculus Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Rc3tOc"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qoVDyy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Climb 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Climb 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyHEb0Brhg8rJjidXB-URSxnBZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079442/Screenshot_2021_12_10_142057.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Crytek&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Climb 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xE1S3"&gt;Definitely not for the acrophobic (fear of heights), &lt;em&gt;The Climb 2 &lt;/em&gt;leverages the same engine used for the &lt;em&gt;Far Cry&lt;/em&gt; franchise into a game focused on mountaineering — or more specifically, rock climbing. &lt;em&gt;The Climb 2&lt;/em&gt; features 12 peaks of steadily increasing difficulty spread across four distinct environments ranging from alpine mountain ranges to urban cityscapes. Each ascent features multiple routes to the top and a scoring system to keep you competing against the best of the best with a global leaderboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8zXiv"&gt;The mechanics of the game are simple and intuitive — using your hands to grip and climb is something that comes pretty naturally. There are some wrinkles that open up as you progress through the game, however, forcing you to leap across gaps and perform tricky “technical holds” to extend your grip on trickier ledges. While not fitness-oriented, playing &lt;em&gt;The Climb 2&lt;/em&gt; for extended periods will definitely work up a sweat, or at the very least, some clammy hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bFLkP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Climb 2&lt;/em&gt; also features seasonal events that rotate every few months that can net you exclusive cosmetic rewards, and while the gameplay isn’t terribly deep, there’s still enough incentive to keep you playing year-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HnA4C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatible with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theclimbgame.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus Quest, Oculus Quest 2, Oculus Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NDR385"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918147" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DPo3yY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IdfcTS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SlYDfPSivhN3ovhzSeG0wVk0Om8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079444/Screenshot_2021_12_10_142159.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YglDax"&gt;This classic entry in the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; franchise has been rereleased more times than we can count, but making the leap to VR platforms has given this aged game a new lease on life. This iteration keeps most of what made the entry great to begin with while excising some parts that have perhaps not aged well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4J6Qiu"&gt;Besides moving the action to a first-person perspective, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; also ups the tension significantly by turning many of the actions that would be relegated to a button press, such as reloading, into manual efforts. It takes more than a few failed attempts before you can successfully reload without panicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B41APA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatible with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeBestVRGames2021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2637179839719680%2F&amp;amp;LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A03yt3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918175" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PX0b36"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rj4Xws"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Half-Life: Alyx" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XrcFlmsHAhylybkpoKrWzD4yMz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079447/half_life_alyx_vr_004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hctXwu"&gt;Who knew that the next &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; game we got would be exclusively for VR? Not that we’re complaining, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; feels like a game that was built exclusively for VR platforms from the ground up. While some other titles feel like they were ported to VR, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is a game that couldn’t succeed in any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTprHM"&gt;Set several years prior to the events of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as the name implies, has you filling the role of the character of Alyx Vance, who served as something of a sidekick to Gordon Freeman during the &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; saga. The narrative is well-written and expertly performed by the entire cast, and while it isn’t essential to have played previous entries in the &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; franchise, your experience will definitely be richer for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z2TVo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; features an impressive armory of weapons and gadgets, including Alyx’s “gravity gloves,” which allow you to interact with just about every object in the environment in some occasionally surprising ways. The first time you intuitively snatch an incoming grenade and fling it back at your would-be assailant is nothing short of a magical moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcTpqr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatible with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Oculus Quest 2 (via Oculus Link), &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus Rift, HTC Vive Pro, Valve Index&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EdKFL7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10918220" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="C79bLZ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="22JQ61"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Star Wars: Squadrons" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VkkxD529-EtekEYEQiXPhhA9Xk4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079448/cockpit_cropped.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Electronic Arts&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EGBJSN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exclusively for VR but features extremely strong VR components that make it a far better experience. This space dogfighter channels the spirit of legacy &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; games like &lt;em&gt;X-Wing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TIE-Fighter&lt;/em&gt; into a wholly modern experience that benefits greatly from the addition of a VR headset. Bonus points if you can throw a HOTAS joystick into the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDhBIm"&gt;Each cockpit is rendered with painstaking detail, making each ship feel distinct. The ability to turn around and see all the buttons and knobs come to life does a great job of selling the overall experience. The VR aspect also ties in with the piloting experience, allowing you to crane your neck around to keep an eye on incoming bandits. Frankly, if you don’t audibly scream when you do your first high-speed pass on a Star Destroyer, you may want to check for a pulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6xsI1"&gt;While much of the allure may be lost on players who aren’t fans of the films, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; features a fairly lengthy single-player campaign that's a solid original &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;story but also serves to introduce you to all the different ships and mechanics. The real meat here is a strong multiplayer component that allows you to take on other players in ship-to-ship dogfights or play in objective-based fleet battles to earn experience and currency to purchase cosmetic items and additional parts for your ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LYxBj8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superhot VR&lt;/em&gt; is the best John Wick video game that isn’t about John Wick. Just like its non-VR predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Superhot VR&lt;/em&gt; has you constantly outnumbered and outgunned in scenarios where a single bullet can kill you — with one twist. Time only progresses when you move. It definitely suffers from the VR problems where “your hands are just guns,” but the time distortion mechanic makes the experience a little more cerebral than your average shooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWQHLW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superhot VR&lt;/em&gt; is really a puzzle game where bullets and the environment make up the pieces.  It challenges you to find creative ways out of tough situations where you’re hopelessly outgunned. Out of bullets? Throw your gun. Don’t have a gun? Pluck an incoming bullet out of the air and fling it at the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RNetQq"&gt;While you can definitely play &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; without VR, this musically charged entry in the classic block-stacking game is different than anything else you’ve experienced from previous iterations. The core experience of &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt; remains unchanged, but &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect VR&lt;/em&gt; is also driven by a euphoric combination of musical rhythms and vivid colors. This means your experience can vary wildly from intense to meditative depending on which level you play. The VR component does a good job of adding depth and dimension to each level and encapsulating your periphery with the sights and sounds that make &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect VR&lt;/em&gt; feel distinctly different from its more standard counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cMSSDu"&gt;Put &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls &lt;/em&gt;into a VR environment and pair it with your favorite roguelike, and you’ve summed up the gameplay of &lt;em&gt;In Death: Unchained&lt;/em&gt;. The story is a bit slim, and the difficulty is absolutely brutal, but &lt;em&gt;In Death: Unchained&lt;/em&gt; is a punishing game that keeps you coming back for more. While combat is limited to bows and different types of arrows, &lt;em&gt;In Death: Unchained&lt;/em&gt; excels in making its weapons feel incredibly satisfying to shoot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbLAl7"&gt;While the original &lt;em&gt;In Death&lt;/em&gt; was made for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, &lt;em&gt;Unchained&lt;/em&gt; is a remake made exclusively for the Oculus Quest 2. This version definitely compromises the graphics a bit to accommodate the hardware but comes packed with some additional levels to bridge the difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vXyOOc"&gt;Considered to be a masterpiece by some, the BAFTA-nominated &lt;em&gt;Rez: Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is a trippy VR experience that's available on all VR platforms. This VR port is a rail shooter at heart, but the unique aesthetics, sound, and music combine to transform &lt;em&gt;Rez: Infinite&lt;/em&gt; into an experience like no other — especially when played in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4ht6T"&gt;You control &lt;em&gt;Rez: Infinite&lt;/em&gt; primarily through head-tracking and controller inputs, which allows you to simply look where you want to aim and press a button to shoot. This makes the experience feel remarkably fluid, especially when paired with the amazing techno soundtrack. The score is driven by the action as enemies release a flurry of loops and beats when they’re destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple investigates Indian iPhone plant after workers strike following mass food poisoning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside the Most Ambitious Push Yet to Make iPhones Outside China" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/duAksKd7Dq0aItXB58n0Pzc1OAg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333312/1164608304.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foxconn’s Indian operation began assembling iPhones for Apple outside of China for the first time in 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uvD0p2"&gt;Apple is sending independent auditors to investigate an iPhone assembly facility in India, after poor working and living conditions at the plant prompted workers to go on strike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CJZgU"&gt;The facility in southern India is operated by longtime Apple partner Foxconn. An &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/women-force-change-indian-iphone-plant-sick-bad-food-crowded-dorms-2021-12-30/?"&gt;investigation by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that women working at the plant were laboring in extremely difficult conditions, forced to sleep on the floor in crowded dorms and sharing toilets without running water. Recently, an outbreak of food poisoning left 150 individuals hospitalized, prompting workers to strike and shut down the plant on December 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCZsop"&gt;In response, Apple says it’s put the plant on “probation” (though the company hasn’t said what this means for Foxconn or the workers who assemble its iPhones). The plant employs some 17,000 people, and is located around 25 miles (40km) west of Chennai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sFxOlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple: “Following recent concerns [...] we dispatched independent auditors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lDvrIJ"&gt;A spokesperson for Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59818796"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “Following recent concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions at Foxconn Sriperumbudur, we dispatched independent auditors. We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements, and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmzBUP"&gt;Foxconn apologized for poor conditions, and, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-29/foxconn-to-overhaul-india-management-after-labor-flareup"&gt;reported by the state government of Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, has agreed to upgrade its facilities — expanding living spaces, improving bathrooms, and providing drinking water. The company says it will resume work at the plant soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Odl2w"&gt;The news illustrates the difficulties Apple faces as it shifts production of its gadgets out of China. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-india-apple-exclusive-idUSKBN24B2GH"&gt;reports in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone-maker has urged suppliers like Taiwan-based Foxconn to move production to other countries like India and Vietnam. This comes as Apple faces criticism at home for outsourcing manufacturing jobs, and pressure in China to accede to demands from the Communist Party regarding censorship and data access. Shifting production out of China gives other parties less leverage over Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3HnZn"&gt;Apple has been repeatedly criticized for the labor conditions involved in constructing its hugely profitable gadgets. Foxconn’s plants in particular have come under scrutiny for their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract"&gt;sweatshop conditions and worker suicides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BlackBerry will die on January 4th — for real this time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uO2QEwgyrYwSJhJP4Sz3r9yp07k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70333149/akrales_180531_2598_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;QWERTY and quirky — Blackberry’s later Android incarnations retained the famous keyboard. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQex1z"&gt;Dear friends, we’re gathered here today to mourn the death of that once-beloved monarch of the mobile world: BlackBerry. And, yes, I realize that this is &lt;em&gt;not the first time&lt;/em&gt; we’ve announced the death of the company or its devices (and, for reasons I’ll explain below, it likely won’t be the last) but this is a very definite ending for legacy BlackBerry hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlXY5O"&gt;As of January 4th, any phones or tablets running BlackBerry’s own software — that’s BlackBerry 7.1 or earlier, BlackBerry 10, or its tablet operating system BlackBerry PlayBook — will “no longer reliably function,” &lt;a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/support/devices/end-of-life"&gt;says the company&lt;/a&gt;. Whether on Wi-Fi or cellular, there’ll be no guarantee you can make phone calls, send text messages, use data, establish an SMS connection, or even call 9-1-1. That sounds pretty darned dead to us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9J1OsT"&gt;If, for whatever inexplicable reason, you or someone you love is still using an original BlackBerry, then we recommend you make it a New Year’s resolution to pry it gently but firmly from their hands. From January 4th onwards, it’ll be little more than a paperweight. (Though BlackBerry devices running Android will continue to work as normal.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="RIM BlackBerry 8310 beat up (1020)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03_rw04RGhfOq5A6Agczeuih_jw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/964696/blackberry-8310-att-busted_1020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elegant phone for a more civilized age: the BlackBerry 8310. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pbeXcJ"&gt;As alluded to above, though, this might not be the last BlackBerry death we announce. The company has experienced a slow and torturous decline since its dominant era in the late 2000s, when its QWERTY keyboards and reputation for security gave it a 50 percent market share in the US, but such a storied brand has to be wrung for its last dregs of value. (Its parent company, BlackBerry Limited, has pivoted to &lt;a href="https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751"&gt;selling cybersecurity software&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbDVFa"&gt;BlackBerry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3929760/blackberry-z10-review"&gt;tried to reboot itself&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 with a new OS, BlackBerry 10 (which failed), and in 2015 switched to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9694374/blackberry-priv-review-android-phone"&gt;making Android devices&lt;/a&gt; (which failed, too). Then, in 2016, it started licensing its brand to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979914/blackberry-global-branding-phone-rights-tcl"&gt;third-party manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; like TCL. This is still how the BlackBerry name lingers on, and in 2020, a Texas firm named OnwardMobility said it would be making a 5G Android-powered BlackBerry device with a full QWERTY keyboard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;to release in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1CVTX"&gt;Well, the clock is rather ticking on that one (OnwardMobility hasn’t shared any news or updates on its website since January 2021), but whether that particular effort lives or dies, it will at least give us a chance to gather again for another funeral. We really must get together some time under kinder circumstances. How are your aunt and uncle anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
