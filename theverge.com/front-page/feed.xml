    <title>The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pace of change is quickening even as Apple tries to stop it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gH3bi2"&gt;Apple’s app store policies have caused controversy and consternation many times over the years, but few periods have been as active and strange as the last two weeks. For the first time, we are seeing Apple being forced to react directly to lawsuits and regulators with substantial policy changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ksp8v4"&gt;The biggest example has of course just happened today: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ruling from judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case&lt;/a&gt;. Apple must now allow apps to link out to other purchasing options in addition to in-app purchases. But that follows two court case settlements and a new law in South Korea that also have implications for how Apple treats developers. The pace of change is increasing and instead of leading, Apple is reacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kc04Fq"&gt;Apple will surely appeal the Epic ruling, but even if it ultimately loses, there’s a good chance that it won’t be enough to appease the legislators and lawyers who are circling Apple’s store as the main way to rein in Apple’s power. And there’s an even better chance that the developers who must try to navigate all those rules will also continue to feel like Apple is spending more effort protecting its profits than empowering developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAdqWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting in 2019, there is an increased cadence of changes in reaction to controversies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8RoO"&gt;Here, then, is a very brief history of the major policy changes and statements Apple has made about the App Store over the years. The impetus for these different changes (or, as Apple tends to call them, “clarifications”) has varied, but the trend has remained the same. Apple has worked hard to keep the fundamental, central model of a 30 percent cut intact while softening it around the edges to appease various constituencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAGEfu"&gt;But just take a look at the timing and cadence of these changes. After a development period from 2007 to 2011 when Apple fills out the features, there’s a large gap when Apple made few notable policy changes. Then, a major shift in 2016 to address some growing discontent among developers. And then, starting in the summer of 2019, there is an ever-increasing cadence of controversies and policy tweaks to address them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WptOz"&gt;As time goes on, policy changes are coming faster and the hairs Apple is splitting are getting thinner. My instinct is to say that enough is enough: Apple should just make a couple of sweeping changes and get it all done at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEiPV0"&gt;Clearly, Apple doesn’t agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGeu0u"&gt;Instead, the company is in a defensive crouch, stepping back only when forced and as little as possible. That might be a good strategy to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1433300497813815304"&gt;make sure every regulator feels like it got its pound of flesh&lt;/a&gt; and thus minimize the change Apple will have to make, as Steven Sinofsky speculated, but it’s a terrible strategy for making developers — and customers — feel good about the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bPidhv"&gt;
&lt;p id="F0QDxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 11th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;At WWDC, Steve Jobs says that Apple won’t have the ability for developers to install “native” apps, but instead will need to use web apps. It was the infamous “&lt;a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/06/13/a-very-sweet-solution/"&gt;sweet solution&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG0Ljf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 17th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind as it becomes clear that the demand is there (and as the home brew app movement gains momentum). It announces it will release an &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/apple-confirms-iphone-sdk-coming-next-year/"&gt;SDK for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUjRqw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 10th, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html"&gt;Apple App Store for the iPhone launches&lt;/a&gt; with 500 apps and a 30 percent cut of all sales going to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjAwSw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7th, 2008 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with Nick Wingfield, Steve Jobs says of the App Store that “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mobile-industrys-never-seen-anything-like-this-an-interview-with-steve-jobs-at-the-app-stores-launch-1532527201?utm_source=Memberful&amp;amp;utm_campaign=5ed0c8b80c-daily_update_2018_08_23&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-5ed0c8b80c-110908273"&gt;we don’t expect this to be a big profit generator&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a57VCB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t expect this to be a big profit generator.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MjCntE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 8th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces that developers will be able to add &lt;a href="https://marco.org/2009/06/20/the-economics-of-in-app-purchase"&gt;in-app purchases &lt;/a&gt;using Apple’s payment processing (and 30 percent cut). It limits in-app purchases to paid apps, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpLdM3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 15th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind and allows &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/15/apple-announces-in-app-purchases-for-free-iphone-applications/"&gt;in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; to be extended to free apps. It drives a huge shift in business models for many games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3o6S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 1st, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html"&gt;Apple begins rejecting apps that don’t use its in-app purchasing system&lt;/a&gt;. It rejects Sony’s e-reader app. Apps are not allowed to link out to purchase or subscription pages within their apps, even if the user completes the purchase in a separate browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QrEf6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 15th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a big new push to bring news and magazines into Apple’s ecosystem, it &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/02/15Apple-Launches-Subscriptions-on-the-App-Store/"&gt;launches subscriptions on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for publishers. Fees are still 30 percent, and Apple makes it easy to unsubscribe — and hard for publishers to gather data about their readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBJ7hA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 28th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we learned in discovery for the recent &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;Apple executive suggests cutting App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; in an internal email on this date. As we all know, that didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf6GQ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan. 15th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5311364/apple-settles-with-ftc-over-in-app-purchases-tim-cook-says"&gt;settles a case with the FTC over in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; and offers consumers $32 million in refunds. It’s a response to a raft of apps using tricky tactics to get in-app purchases. Over time, more parental controls, restraints on those purchases, and oversight on apps are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DL5TzJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 9th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7249917/apple-swaps-free-for-get-in-app-store"&gt;changes the button naming&lt;/a&gt; on the App Store from “free” to “get,” to better reflect that some games have in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="jVhHJs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now we’re going to open up to all categories, and that includes games, which is a huge category.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQ5OLNmgzrmm0oFqQJh0vyzX4pY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13085425/jbareham_160607_1080_0005_final_02.0.0.1465351786.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cOkYA1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 16th, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a massive and consequential change to the app economy, Apple introduces a much-expanded model for subscriptions for apps. It was big enough that our article on the event dubbed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview"&gt;App Store 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. The changes included dropping Apple’s fee to 15 percent after the first year of subscription revenue. This is also when Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618044341/https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;the concept of the “reader app”&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial category that allowed users to access subscription content purchased elsewhere (like Netflix or Kindle) but disallowed linking out to those purchase options. Finally, Apple announced it would begin introducing ads in App Store search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSfemg"&gt;The change was so big that at that year’s WWDC, Apple &lt;a href="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/App-Review-Guidelines-The-Comic-Book.pdf"&gt;commissioned a graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; where the art told one story but all the text was literally the App Store rules. In one section, we see the story of a son getting a haircut for his father’s funeral while the captions list the “acceptable” business models in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whNxT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 1st, 2016 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 2020 House subcommittee investigation revealed that in 2016, Amazon has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;secret deal&lt;/a&gt; with Apple that grants it lower fees than were available to other developers. Earlier in 2020, Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;attempted to claim&lt;/a&gt; the deal was an “established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers.” Even if it was “established,” it certainly wasn’t widely known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvyZgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 5th, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;During its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple quietly updates its guidelines to allow for so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17430532/apple-app-store-rules-valve-steam-link-game-streaming"&gt;remote mirroring apps like Steam Link&lt;/a&gt;. It didn’t allow for full game services on the App Store, but carved out the ability to mirror a PC on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU1JZ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 28th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A controversy grows over Apple’s crackdown on developers who use enterprise tools for managing iPhones to offer parental controls to consumers. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report"&gt;Apple needed to publicly explain why it was banning those apps&lt;/a&gt;. The move was viewed as anti-competitive because Apple had its own parental controls. Apple countered that those enterprise tools could be misused by hackers in a consumer context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50sQQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 29th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple publishes a new webpage (since changed) titled &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190529141133/https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/principles-practices/"&gt;App Store Principles and Practices&lt;/a&gt;. It was essentially a marketing page designed to explain Apple’s rules for the App Store and why it believed those guidelines protected consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Varub9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18653142/apple-mdm-parental-control-screen-time-app-store-guidelines-update"&gt;another quiet update during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, Apple updates its guidelines to allow enterprise tools to be used for parental controls, allowing them to use mobile device manager and VPN APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxrmCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 12th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692228/apple-banned-parental-control-ourpact-mdm-app-store-control-back"&gt;Apple begins restoring banned parental control apps&lt;/a&gt; to the App Store following the controversy earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grKKJJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1st, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the date we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;officially learned about the so-called “established” program&lt;/a&gt; for video streaming providers to bypass the 30 percent fee for individual video rentals and purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="fWLDrr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There is no chance in bloody hell that we're going to pay Apple's ransom. I will burn this house down myself, before I let gangsters like that spin it for spoils. This is profoundly, perversely abusive and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272972718384623616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oUzZY3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 22nd, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what turned out to be a big controversy for the App Store, an email app called Hey is banned because it did not offer a way to sign up for the $99 / year service inside the app itself. At issue was that “reader” app category — only those types of apps were allowed to use that business model and Apple said email didn’t count. On this date, Hey made a minor change to its app to skirt Apple’s requirement that apps provide functionality without an outside subscription and so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;Apple approves the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxM5cW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 6th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new battle, streaming games platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud are officially banned from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s ruling requires every game on the services to be submitted individually — a nonstarter for those services. Ultimately both would eventually return as browser-based apps after Apple quietly added the necessary Safari support for them to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTQiDD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 13th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicks &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; following Epic’s gambit to add its own in-app purchases to the game. It would kick off a huge battle — both in the court of public opinion and in actual court. The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case would turn out to be a major event in the App Store saga, revealing all sorts of internal emails and ultimately leading to consequential rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWPSH2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 18th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to hang on to its 30 percent cut but still grant smaller developers some concessions, Apple introduces the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;.” Developers who make less than $1 million per year were allowed to apply to join the program and have their cut reduced to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6fna"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 11th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple makes it official that streaming game services are allowed in the App Store, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if each game inside the services are submitted individually&lt;/a&gt;. It is still not enough for Stadia and xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BjuyJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 23rd, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new 16-page report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546771/apple-side-loading-security-risk-report-regulatory-pressure"&gt;Apple lays out its arguments against allowing sideloading iPhone&lt;/a&gt; apps in a report titled “Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps,” claiming the practice would make its phones less secure and trustworthy for users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PpH2rR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has had to change more App Store policies between August 26th,2021 to September 10th than in any other period in its history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uw1ZMM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces another new program offering a lower rate to a subset of developers. Under the new program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;news publishers that participated in Apple News to a sufficient degree qualify for a 15 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; on their other apps instead of 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuZn3X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;settles a class action lawsuit with developers&lt;/a&gt;. In the proposed settlement, the company “clarifies” that developers are allowed to email their users directly with information about how they could subscribe to services outside the App Store. It’s unclear if this is actually a change and even if it is, it’s a tiny one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsgi0n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 31st, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;new law in South Korea requires both Google and Apple to allow for third-party payment systems&lt;/a&gt; on apps in their respective app stores. It’s too soon to see how the companies will react and what the law’s effect both inside and outside South Korea will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtYNI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 1st, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another lawsuit settlement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle have a single link out to their payment services inside their apps.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a tiny crack in the so-called “anti-steering” rules, but it’s limited to a single link and limited to the so-called “reader apps” category that Apple itself has defined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZX3O9U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple rules that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;won’t allow &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to return to the App Store in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, despite the new law there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rBnZlc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;huge ruling in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the judge says that Apple is “permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.” It is also established that Apple does not have an illegal monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYUFPs"&gt;Appeals from both Epic and Apple are expected. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on September 14th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4jNRlj"&gt;Autumn is quickly approaching, which to Apple aficionados can mean only one thing: the next iPhone is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTkCLy"&gt;Apple’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; on September 14th will likely introduce more than just the iPhone 13, however. Rumors point toward a new Apple Watch, the Series 7, as well as the next iteration of the AirPods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nrAUh"&gt;Reports and leaks indicate the new iPhone 13 lineup will feature four models that will come in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;same sizes as last year’s models&lt;/a&gt;. The new phones will likely boast high refresh rate screens, a smaller display notch, and a faster A15 Bionic chip. On the camera front, we may see the introduction of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618070/apple-2021-iphone-13-camera-features-video-portrait-prores-ai-filters"&gt;video portrait mode and an astrophotography mode&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an improved ultrawide lens and a better optical zoom for video recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKkGRw"&gt;We also expect Apple to debut the third generation of AirPods, which may take on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;similar design&lt;/a&gt; to the AirPods Pro, with a new case and shorter stems. As for the Apple Watch 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;rumors indicate&lt;/a&gt; it will include a faster processor and sport its first hardware redesign in years, with flatter edges, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;new watchfaces&lt;/a&gt;, and larger screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTwsG2"&gt;New MacBooks and an updated iPad Mini could potentially show up, too. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; will likely include Apple’s new, custom-designed chips and bring back previous inputs, like the HDMI port and SD card slot. The next iPad Mini, meanwhile, will reportedly feature its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;biggest revamp in nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a larger display and a design that closely mirrors last year’s iPad Air. We also can’t write out the possibility of a few surprises or updates to Apple’s many services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7amfL"&gt;Regardless of what’s announced, however, we’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here as new products and services are shown.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The future of the App Store depends on the difference between a ‘button’ and an ‘external link’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vy4Q_o9osraEtBdhj7-upmYhknw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841408/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MT0tTw"&gt;Today the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; issued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;a lengthy ruling&lt;/a&gt; holding that Epic failed to prove that Apple has a monopoly in mobile gaming transactions. Importantly, the court &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; held that Apple’s rules preventing other payment options in the App Store are anti-competitive, and issued an injunction telling Apple to cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksxyl2"&gt;Specifically, the court said that “Apple is engaging in anticompetitive conduct,” and that “Apple’s anti-steering provisions hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JTP8T"&gt;To fix that, the court issued the following permanent injunction barring Apple from having rules against other payment systems. I’ve bolded the most relevant bit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EtU3FP"&gt;Apple Inc. and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and any person in active concert or participation with them (“Apple”), are hereby &lt;strong&gt;permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from (i) including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing &lt;/strong&gt;and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xjEJAT"&gt;This specific wording is lifted directly from &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;Apple’s App Store rule 3.1.1&lt;/a&gt;, which says “Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase,” so it’s tempting to think that the judge just declared that rule anti-competitive and crossed it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ixKZS"&gt;But it’s a little more complicated than that — now that this text is in a judicial order, it no longer belongs to Apple or &lt;em&gt;needs to be interpreted how Apple wants&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, the court was clear that it will enforce this rule, and that if anyone thinks Apple is breaking it, it wants to know. Again, my bolding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VEvUbT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Court will retain jurisdiction over the enforcement and amendment of the injunction.&lt;/strong&gt; If any part of this Order is violated by any party named herein or any other person, plaintiff may, by motion with notice to the attorneys for defendant, apply for sanctions or other relief that may be appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn4DTb"&gt;So now comes the &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; complicated part. What does this injunction mean for Apple and the App Store? Let’s break this rule down piece by piece — the difference between a “button” and an “external link” is going to be remarkably important here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x51bDQ"&gt;Apple is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="1yU2zh"&gt;not allowed to prohibit developers from including in their apps and their metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XLnLTS"&gt;buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rMZ1Gz"&gt;external links, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x5STCd"&gt;other calls to action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v3503i"&gt;that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r7UTkx"&gt;in addition to In-App Purchasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Glj7SW"&gt;We can make some versions of this sentence make sense really easily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1kGHQd"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including external links in their apps that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CK5L4c"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including calls to action in app metadata [like descriptions in the App Store] that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SkVZvS"&gt;But consider the following version of this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="72EBdp"&gt;Apple is not allowed to prohibit developers from including buttons in their apps that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aHyssa"&gt;Well, shit. Here is an example of a button that takes you to a purchasing mechanism in the Amazon app:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “checkout” button in an Amazon cart that has Airpods Pro in it" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uG7zasG_It_epZG_Ls3uTmR5JgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840636/IMG_8A3B35F71848_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A button in an app that directs customers to a purchasing mechanism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BnS3U9"&gt;This is the ball game! What does it mean for a &lt;em&gt;button&lt;/em&gt; in an app to “direct a customer to purchasing mechanisms”? Is it a checkout button? Can Amazon add a cart, a checkout button, and payments to the Kindle app now? The court isn’t stupid — it specified &lt;em&gt;buttons&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;external links&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which means they are presumed to be distinct. So a button can’t just be an external link that kicks you to Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ijTaRJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will try to say that “button” just means &lt;em&gt;what something looks like&lt;/em&gt;, while developers will say that “button” means &lt;em&gt;how something works&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJx4EX"&gt;That means that a fair reading of the plain text of this injunction suggests that buttons in iOS apps can direct users to purchasing mechanisms &lt;em&gt;in the app — &lt;/em&gt;if the button just kicks you out to the web, it would be an external link!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA4bSG"&gt;I am confident a lot of developers are going to test this language in aggressive ways, and that Apple will find itself developing new rules to protect its lucrative in-app purchasing system from competition. And I’m confident Apple will try to say that “button” just means &lt;em&gt;what something looks like&lt;/em&gt;, while developers will say that “button” means &lt;em&gt;how something works&lt;/em&gt;. (There is a lot of irony in this for Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8Ce7v"&gt;But in the end, it won’t be up to Apple to decide what this order means — it will be up the court. And that is a delicate position to be in, because the court explicitly thinks the anti-steering rule is very anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcgjDg"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the difference between buttons and external links.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic will appeal the Epic v. Apple decision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Itgpx4J9Ik0-m58gGeDlbCPixK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841352/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxt2Xf"&gt;If you’re wondering whether Epic Games is satisfied &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ decision&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone and iPad developers a way around Apple’s 30 percent cut, the answer is most definitely no. Epic will appeal the court’s ruling in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FI8oa"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine why: Epic lost on every other count. Apple will not be forced to allow users to sideload apps, or accept other app stores, or lower its fee below 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfJxTz"&gt;The lone decision against Apple was a significant one, but it only forces Apple to allow app developers to point to their own choice of payment methods instead of Apple’s IAP — and Epic might not even benefit from that decision unless Apple agrees to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back to the App Store to begin with. That’s yet another thing the court didn’t mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnt9zK"&gt;Epic’s also being forced to pay Apple a few million dollars, not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but not a winning look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6keba"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370670166945792"&gt;made it clear on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t see the decision as a win: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZJKihQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today’s ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers. Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cGTBxThnsP"&gt;https://t.co/cGTBxThnsP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370670166945792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ry9Qis"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks to everyone who put so much time and effort into the battle over fair competition on digital platforms, and thanks especially to the court for managing a very complex case on a speedy timeline. We will fight on.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370884994928641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eR8LkS"&gt;He also suggests that Epic, not Apple, is in control of when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; returns to the App Store, but it reads like sour grapes. Sure, Epic might decide to withhold the game until or unless Apple provides more favorable terms, but right now Epic doesn’t have the ability to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back even if it wanted to. It’s not clear whether Apple is even interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MVGKA"&gt;In fact, we’re currently waiting to see if Apple will cut off Epic’s developer account for Unreal Engine, too. When the ruling takes effect on December 9th, it will also end a preliminary injunction that kept Apple from doing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTju8Y"&gt;It’s not clear whether Apple might also want to appeal. It’s possible! Publicly, the company called it a “huge win” and a “resounding victory,” writing that “the headline is that Apple’s app store business model has been validated.” But it’s not entirely a win. If app developers have the ability to ditch in-app payments for the likes of PayPal and Stripe, it could put some of Apple’s billions at risk. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Fortnite return to iOS? Probably not any time soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCJaB_ulaSaPjWnk8uFkqhVYh_s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841144/vpavic_180607_2652_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fD3GeK"&gt;The ruling is in on the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Epic won a major concession&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to allowing alternative in-app purchase options, but Apple won out on basically all other counts. The question now is: where does that leave &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;been out of the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; since it first violated Apple’s rules by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;offering its own payment options&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAKAE9"&gt;For the moment, it sounds like the game isn’t coming back right away. The judge did not say that Apple would be required to restore the game, and neither Apple nor Epic have indicated that it’ll return any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1HiVc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants “fair competition” before ‘Fortnite’ returns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iX1kN5"&gt;In fact, Epic seems to have indicated that it’s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;satisfied with the ruling and won’t be restoring &lt;em&gt;Fornite &lt;/em&gt;just yet. In a tweet, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;will return “when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment.” Plus, Epic has already said it plans to appeal the ruling, which raises the question of whether these new rules will even go into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmTIqy"&gt;Apple has contended that Epic has been the one holding &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;back all along. The company said earlier today (in response to a new Korean law) that the company would “welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” which means getting rid of its in-app payments system. Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;tried to have its app restored in Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple rejected it again on the same grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhLttP"&gt;Today’s ruling requires Apple to allow apps to offer buttons and links to third-party payment options — but crucially, it’s not entirely clear whether the specific payment system Epic tried to add to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will be allowed. If apps want to use another payment system, they can send users &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the app, and Apple can’t stop them from doing so. But there’s some ambiguity on whether a full-on in-app payment alternative has to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8c9zS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple still has to restore Epic’s developer account&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwrxWG"&gt;It’s likely that Apple will make it difficult for outside payment systems to offer a smooth and integrated experience. It’s possible that gamers will still be required to pop out to Epic’s website every time they want to make a transaction. That’s better than nothing, but Sweeney’s tweet suggests he may not view it as “fair competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3B9MT"&gt;The flip side of this is that it’s not even up to Epic when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;returns. Even if Epic caves and makes the changes, Apple still needs to restore Epic’s developer account and approve &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;for distribution. Apple has said it’s open to this, but Apple’s still the one determining whether Epic is adhering to those rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccJ9kk"&gt;There’s also the question of when and whether these rules go into effect. The ruling doesn’t go into effect for another 90 days, and that’s assuming an appeal doesn’t result in the ruling being put on hold. So the likely result is this: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;won’t return at a minimum until Apple puts new rules into place. We don’t know when that’ll happen, and even then it’s up to both companies to agree that the game is compliant with the new rules. There’s a good chance that’ll take more than 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos raises prices for majority of products amid supply chain crunch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MnAN891ASL0LUpM08Y2CoUs4BWQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840929/Sonos1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DXux3"&gt;Sonos has announced that many of its speakers will be getting a price increase, ranging from $10 more for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;its portable Roam&lt;/a&gt;, to $100 more for its Arc soundbar. The company says that the price increases are making good on a promise it made during a call with investors last month, and that the increases would be going into effect on Sunday, September 12th. (We’ve reached out to Sonos to clarify if there’s a specific time the increase will happen.) You can see a table with all the price changes below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAr0qZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/672173472/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FINAL-SONO-3Q21-Conference-Call-Transcript.pdf"&gt;During its earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Sonos cited both supply and demand factors in its decision to raise prices. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the company said it’s “always assessing market dynamics — including demand, supply chain, component costs and the competitive landscape.” This seems to imply that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the current chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has something to do with these price increases, at least in part. That would also imply that the increased prices will be around for a while: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;some industry leaders predict&lt;/a&gt; that the shortage, which has affected &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, consoles, and computers, will last at least through next year, if not beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzbhMb"&gt;Sonos’ announcement doesn’t give consumers a lot of time to decide whether they want to purchase one of the company’s speakers before the prices go up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple judge rules Fortnite’s Peely can appear naked in court</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7vz312XXunEVo09hNPikh7yePQ=/0x1:581x388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840700/peely.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peely the banana.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fREBOK"&gt;One of the more bizarre moments of this year’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was when proceedings got derailed by an exchange about whether Peely the banana — a recurring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;character — should be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429267/epic-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-trial-peely-day-6"&gt;expected to wear clothes in court&lt;/a&gt;. Apple suggested Peely ought to wear clothes in federal court and showed him in a tuxedo; Epic argued the suit was unnecessary. And you better believe the judge’s ruling, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;released today&lt;/a&gt;, has come to a final conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="H5KlDq"&gt;With respect to the appropriateness of Peely’s “dress,” the Court understood Apple merely to be “dressing” Peely in a tuxedo for federal court, as jest to reflect the general solemnity of a federal court proceeding. As Mr. Weissinger later remarked, and with which the Court agrees, Peely is “just a banana man,” additional attire was not necessary but informative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vPICVa"&gt;The moment in question came on day six of the trial, when Apple’s attorney was cross-examining Matthew Weissinger, Epic’s VP of marketing, in order to offer a tutorial of how exactly &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; works. During the exchange, Apple’s attorney noted that they’d chosen to show Peely in his “Agent Peely” guise, since “We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBX5KS"&gt;Now, obviously, this was a joke. It was a small lighthearted moment during an antitrust-focused court case. But after Apple criticized Epic for hosting the Itch.io storefront and with it, its “so-called adult games,” Epic’s attorney simply couldn’t let Apple get away with implying that its naked banana was inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fh9hyX"&gt;“If we could just put on the screen a picture of Peely — is there anything inappropriate about Peely without clothes?” Epic’s attorney asked Weissinger two hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abuxwh"&gt;“It’s just a banana man,” Weissinger was forced to respond. (NB: We originally transcribed this exchange as “just a banana, ma’am,” but the court’s transcription is final).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDZhc6"&gt;In the end, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ judgement sensibly points out what basically everyone understood at the time: Peely’s “just a banana man” and “additional attire was not necessary.” Checkmate, Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7RtPR"&gt;You can check out the relevant section for yourself on page eight of the document below. Neither Epic nor Apple have publicly stated whether they plan to appeal this portion of the judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google search is finally officially getting dark mode on desktop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mz9JHPyqhfC6N_T50-iFsO8FuG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840690/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGSLCz"&gt;Google is finally adding an official dark mode to search on desktops, letting those who prefer to avoid bright webpages complete their searches while bathed in inky gray (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/09/google-search-dark-theme-desktop/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/125141564/dark-theme-now-available-on-google-search-desktop"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, you can make the change by going to Settings &amp;gt; Search Settings &amp;gt; Appearance. There, you’ll be able to choose light, dark, or device default, which will automatically follow your computer’s mode. If you don’t see the Appearance option, you may have to wait a bit: Google says the setting will be “rolling out over the next few weeks,” as many of its updates do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZhkOf"&gt;Google has been toying with dark mode search for a while now — we noted that it was in testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276553/google-search-dark-mode-desktop"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. To take you behind the scenes a bit, since then, we’ve had a few staff members randomly get and lose dark mode as the test continued. Now, though, it’s finally official.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RRn0GBEDPTLEw_s5Dgz0ETQrrmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838618/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_5.00.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google results, but dark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NnFnMx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/09/google-search-dark-theme-desktop/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; some users seeing another quick toggle sun icon and that a few people have the option to enable the change on the mobile web version of Google. Neither change is mentioned in Google’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mb71dZ3ev1kw2TFhqZd0BgcznRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838638/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_5.16.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have quick access to the setting via an “Appearance” link.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n2fqA1"&gt;Of course, you’ve had options to search darkly before now — you could turn Google dark using browser plugins or use themes on alternative search engines like DuckDuckGo. Many of Google’s Android and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606644/google-maps-ios-dark-mode-widgets-share-location-imessage"&gt;iOS apps&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264056/google-app-dark-mode-android-ios"&gt;the main Google search app&lt;/a&gt;, have also had a dark mode for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEey1f"&gt;But Google making it officially available as a setting will make it much easier for those who just couldn’t be bothered to install an extension or switch search providers. Plus, it will hopefully alleviate the experience of logging on to a new device and trying to search for something, only to be blasted with the light of a thousand suns. Perhaps that’s a bit hyperbolic, but hey — all hail the darkness (and the small quality-of-life improvements).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch sues two alleged ‘hate raiders’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c658U8pXol5cqldiXEDcwMoULAI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840688/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_hate_raid_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7TAPZ"&gt;After months of combating a tidal wave of harassment campaigns targeting marginalized streamers, Twitch has filed a suit against two alleged “hate raiders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9ydKo"&gt;First &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitch-sues-users-over-alleged-hate-raids/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524416914/Twitch-Interactive-vs-Cruzzcontrol-and-CreatineOverdose"&gt;the suit&lt;/a&gt;, filed yesterday in US Federal Court, names two defendants, CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose, and alleges the two were responsible in part for the rash of “hate raids” that have plagued Twitch since the beginning of August. In the lawsuit, Twitch said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gX0EGu"&gt;CruzzControl is responsible for nearly 3,000 bot accounts associated with hate raids. Bots developed and deployed by CruzzControl have been linked to various hate raid events, including those targeting black and LGBTQIA+ streamers with racist, homophobic, sexist, and other harassing content. CruzzControl has admitted to using bots to flood Twitch channels with harassing content. They have also demonstrated how the bots work so others can use similar methods to accomplish hate raids. Twitch has also linked CreatineOverdose directly to hate raids. For example, on August 15th, 2021, Defendant CreatineOverdose used their bot software to demonstrate how it could be used to spam Twitch channels with racial slurs, graphic descriptions of violence against minorities, and claims that the hate raiders are the “K K K.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AC8JyE"&gt;CreatineOverdose was one of the first accounts identified by streamers as being responsible for the hate raids, and there is at least one incident in which CreatineOverdose admitted to being a perpetrator in a streamer’s chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gi0232"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Man is really casually talkin in chats.&lt;br&gt;Feel like this shit is actually never going to stop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean it’s nothing new to me on this site but the fact it’s trending this month is sad. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitchSupport&lt;/a&gt; what are y’all doing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sucks to be left in the dark as ppl leave the site &lt;a href="https://t.co/2gKOMfrX8d"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2gKOMfrX8d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— a Beige Question Mark (@ItsWoofy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ItsWoofy/status/1428060621560557568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ogdW84"&gt;The suit does not identify either defendant beyond their Twitch usernames but does say that both reside in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="AbfmQt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10745493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ww5RHo"&gt;Hate raids happen when malicious actors weaponize bots and the raid feature to spam streamers’ chats with racist, transphobic, and homophobic messages. Hate raids have happened on the platform for a while, but incidents have recently exploded uncontrollably with Black, brown, queer, and trans streamers suffering the majority of attacks. In response, streamers and Twitch community members created their own resources to combat hate raids while also vocally criticizing Twitch for not doing more or acting swiftly enough to protect its users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6zsXj"&gt;On September 1st, streamer &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shineypen"&gt;ShineyPen&lt;/a&gt; organized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;A Day Off Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, which asked users to not stream or watch Twitch for a day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654534/streamers-twitch-walkout-viewership-drop"&gt;in order to bring attention to the problem&lt;/a&gt;. Twitch responded to the calls for action with several updates to its safety features and a promise that more action was forthcoming. This suit is part of that action. A Twitch spokesperson said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pV0ez5"&gt;Yesterday, Twitch filed a complaint in U. S. Federal Court against individuals involved in the recent chat-based attacks against marginalized streamers. The malicious actors involved have been highly motivated in breaking our Terms of Service, creating new waves of fake bot accounts designed to harass Creators even as we continually update our sitewide protections against their rapidly evolving behaviors. While we have identified and banned thousands of accounts over the past weeks, these actors continue to work hard on creative ways to circumvent our improvements, and show no intention of stopping. We hope this Complaint will shed light on the identity of the individuals behind these attacks and the tools that they exploit, dissuade them from taking similar behaviors to other services, and help put an end to these vile attacks against members of our community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25ctiz"&gt;This Complaint is by no means the only action we’ve taken to address targeted attacks, nor will it be the last. Our teams have been working around the clock to update our proactive detection systems, address new behaviors as they emerge, and finalize new proactive, channel-level safety tools that we’ve been developing for months. Hate and harassment have no place on Twitch, and we know we have a lot more work to do–but we hope that these combined actions will help reduce the immediate and unacceptable harm that targeted attacks have been inflicting on our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jkR6bx"&gt;While hate raids are still happening on Twitch, affected users do see this suit positively. &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciaeverblack"&gt;Lucia Everblack&lt;/a&gt;, one of the organizers of #ADayOffTwitch, thinks this is a good step. “It obviously doesn’t address the larger issues about how this still continues to happen but does send a message that the people doing it can be found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guSLZd"&gt;Another streamer who started the &lt;a href="https://hateraidresponse.carrd.co/"&gt;Hate Raid Response website&lt;/a&gt; — a place where streamers can utilize and share tools, programs, and tips on how to prevent or stop hate raids — said, “This is a step in the right direction and for the gaming community at large: accountability. Nothing on the internet is actually anonymous and there are real life consequences to the things you say and do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvGQ5w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos’ second-generation Symfonisk lamp leaks with swappable lampshades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFj2EB8WEceErfOrmcKLTnkc_zs=/1x0:1126x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840605/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_12.38.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYl1Wp"&gt;Ikea’s second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;Symfonisk table lamp speaker&lt;/a&gt; has leaked thanks to a support document posted to Ikea’s Portuguese website (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/pl8xrt/new_symfonisk_lamp_v_2_leaked_pictures_and/"&gt;spotted by a Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; who claims to have encountered the lamp shades in a store), featuring a new design that streamlines the speaker-lamp’s base and adds the much-needed option to swap in different styles of lampshades, via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jank0/status/1436360409661927425"&gt;Janko Roettgers on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbh2KY"&gt;Compared to the original Symfonisk table lamp, the new model appears to have ditched the platter-like base for a design that integrates the speaker controllers directly into the unit. But the biggest change is the lampshade component, which ditches the mushroom-like opaque glass shade for removable, swappable options. And like the original, the new model will support both Sonos’ multiroom audio system and Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svw16KytOPN1gFW998gwq4PK0p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840160/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_12.35.29_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The different configuration options for the new Symfonisk speaker lamp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="slFp7F"&gt;The support document lists two different shade options: a cylindrical glass option that looks like an open-ended version of the original model’s shade and a new translucent fabric option. Both shades will be available in black and white color schemes and cost €20 (around $23.64) each, while the main speaker component is listed as costing €129 (around $152.49). For comparison, the original Symfonisk table lamp cost $179 when it was first released, which is roughly the same as the two separate pieces of the second-generation model together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D96EHJ"&gt;The new table lamp — which had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22464111/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-leak"&gt;previously rumored&lt;/a&gt; alongside the since-released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;Symfonisk picture frame speakers&lt;/a&gt; — has yet to be officially announced by Sonos or Ikea. That said, given that the device is already appearing in support documents, it’ll likely only be a matter of time before a more formal announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddubrP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
