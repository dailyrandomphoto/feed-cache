    <title>The fan-equipped Zephyr Pro gaming mouse is much cooler than the original</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Cooler, quieter, cheaper&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="g6Y20D"&gt;About a year ago, I wrote about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400620/zephyr-gaming-mouse-built-in-cooling-fan"&gt;gaming mouse called the Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; that came with a unique feature: a built-in fan designed to cool your palm as you play games. It didn’t blow me away; the fan was loud, vibrated a lot, and didn’t really feel all that cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcfMaF"&gt;But the creators, now known as Marsback, have returned with a new “sweat-proof” gaming mouse called the Zephyr Pro. And it’s a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QRGmDp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10703431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vv4E7F"&gt;The external design hasn’t changed all that much. The Zephyr Pro is a fairly unremarkable-looking gaming mouse with the requisite RGB lighting and a honeycomb chassis to reduce weight and increase airflow. The main RGB lighting strip now runs around the bottom edge of the mouse rather than around the left and right buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdMA44"&gt;The Pro doesn’t expand input options any more than its predecessor; there’s still a standard layout of two side buttons and one up top to control DPI sensitivity. It’s understandably lightweight by design but doesn’t feel too cheap, and it worked perfectly well for me through dozens of hours of various shooters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vxm02j"&gt;The main change is in the performance of the fan itself. I often found myself switching it off on the original Zephyr because of the noise and vibration, but both have been cut down significantly with the Pro. It’s not silent, exactly, but unlike the original it’s hard to hear over the hum of a regular PC or laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wz7PBpAQA_uTqrsKxYvYXTR79b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22784991/DSCF7735.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uwAR1l"&gt;The quieter fan doesn’t represent a reduction in cooling power, according to Marsback. The Pro model I’ve been testing is actually much more effective at cooling, though that’s in comparison to a prototype of the original Zephyr rather than the final product. The fan now fires directly upward instead of at a 45-degree angle, which seems to make a difference. You still shouldn’t expect to feel like your palm is being blasted by an air conditioner, but I do enjoy the cooling effect overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fM7MsM"&gt;The Zephyr Pro has on-board memory and software to let you customize button functionality and RGB lighting, with extensive options for both. Surprisingly, there’s no way to adjust the fan speed — you just switch it on and off with a button on the bottom of the mouse. Unlike the original Zephyr, though, there isn’t really any reason to want to turn the fan down, since it’s quiet enough at full blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qGE8qY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qLJjEC"&gt;Finally, one of the Zephyr Pro’s best new features is the price. $59 is pretty reasonable for a wired mouse like this and much more competitive than the $99 original Zephyr. Marsback also currently has an offer for $10 off your first order from its &lt;a href="https://marsback.com/products/marsback-zephyr-pro-gaming-mouse-with-built-in-fan"&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpzuz4"&gt;There are certainly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;a lot of good options&lt;/a&gt; at this price point that don’t come with a fan, so this mouse still isn’t going to be for everyone. But as someone who lives in a city with godawful summers, I’ve enjoyed the Zephyr Pro these past few weeks. Gaming hardware tends to run hot, so it’s refreshing to use an accessory that goes the opposite route.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Dopesick, Impeachment: American Crime Story, Midnight Mass, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDIHVyPQ5BC-Ogt7UJ0sAFUbwkc=/0x21:1359x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69729220/dopesick.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Keaton stars as a doctor who prescribes OxyContin to his patients in &lt;em&gt;Dopesick&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYU1kzGn4rk&amp;amp;ab_channel=Hulu" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sam53s"&gt;In addition to keeping up with &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;(seems like people either really &lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-ted-lasso-christmas-episode-is-a-gift-1847472927"&gt;loved&lt;/a&gt; or really &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/apple-tv-plus/ted-lasso-season-2-episodes-4-christmas-review/"&gt;hated&lt;/a&gt; the latest Christmas-themed episode; I liked it but admit I found it a bit jarring that the show hit pause on several promising plot lines so Ted could wear a Santa hat&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;, I also got caught up in &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus, a &lt;/em&gt;series that everyone on Twitter is apparently watching. &lt;em&gt;Lotus&lt;/em&gt; has its first-season finale tonight, and while I’m an episode behind right now, I’m sort of pushing myself to see it through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yleKGI"&gt;There are standout performances by Steve Zahn and Jennifer Coolidge, but the show’s just not clicking for me so far. Bad things happen to mostly awful people and one dies, but we don’t know who yet. The show takes place in Hawaii and is apparently trying to make some meta-commentary on white privilege but as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/22621960/white-lotus-native-hawaiians-hbo"&gt;Mitchell Kuga writes for Vox&lt;/a&gt;, the show treats most of the native Hawaiians as little more than plot devices for the dreadful vacationers, so what’s &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/em&gt; actually saying? I guess we’ll find out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQiLWT"&gt;Now on to the new batch of trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NUUT8v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYU1kzGn4rk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SHlQh0"&gt;Dopesick &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JsoE0r"&gt;This miniseries is based on the Beth Macy book “Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors and the Drug Company that Addicted America,” and there’s your plot right there in the title. A pharma company causes a drug epidemic by misrepresenting its new painkiller OxyContin as having a low risk of addiction. Michael Keaton, Peter Sarsgaard, Michael Stuhlbarg, Will Poulter, John Hoogenakker, Kaitlyn Dever, Phillipa Soo, and Rosario Dawson star in &lt;em&gt;Dopesick&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Hulu on October 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s6oZai"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtipQ3EsGWo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XX6CNj"&gt;Impeachment: American Crime Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="z5GAEd"&gt;The story of former President Clinton’s impeachment and his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky is retold in this series “through the eyes of the women at the center of the events,” according to FX Networks’ promo copy. That’s promising, because the way Lewinsky was treated in the press at the time this all went down (recall that it was referred to as the “Lewinsky scandal” not the “president abuses his authority” scandal) was shameful. Lewinsky serves as executive producer on the series, which is promising as well. Sarah Paulson, Beanie Feldstein, Annaleigh Ashford, Margo Martindale, Edie Falco, and Clive Owen star in &lt;em&gt;Impeachment&lt;/em&gt; which premieres on FX September 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jjClsE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwVLObz0MGs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TD9PX8"&gt;Clickbait&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JS8nXO"&gt;Regular guy Nick Brewer disappears, presumed kidnapped, and later appears in a livestream holding signs that claim he abuses women and has murdered one as well. Once the stream reaches 5 million views, according to his signs, Brewer will die. Is he being set up, or is something dark lurking beneath the family-man façade? Each episode of this limited series is told from a different character’s point of view. Adrian Grenier, Zoe Kazan, and Betty Gabriel star in &lt;em&gt;Clickbait&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Netflix August 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aQQjW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NbwjAK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1I6p1yxZ_LE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GlAA05"&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8wgOoY"&gt;You can certainly say one thing about Nicolas Cage: He doesn’t choose boring roles. And right here in this trailer, he’s quoted as describing &lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt; as “the wildest movie I’ve ever made,” so that’s something, right? He plays a criminal in a bomb suit who has to venture into the titular Ghostland —which looks kinda &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt;-y and kinda &lt;em&gt;Blade Runne&lt;/em&gt;r-y— to rescue the missing granddaughter of a crime lord. He’s got five days before the bombs, strategically placed on his body, go off. There’s some kind of nuclear explosion involved, too and of course Cage punches some guys and does his usual half-brooding/half-glowering look. Bill Moseley and Sofia Boutella star along with Cage in &lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and on demand September 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KMnDEj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/89UV8vmWXlY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QAhhjL"&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HonBPx"&gt;From Mike Flanagan, the creator of &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;, comes this limited series about isolated Crockett Island, which is experiencing unexplained supernatural events— are they miracles? Eh, not likely. Zach Gifford, Hamish Linklater, Kate Siegel, Annabeth Gish, Henry Thomas, and Michael Trucco are among the cast of &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;, which arrives on Netflix September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile investigating report of customer data breach that reportedly involves 100 million people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBvzYD9tqzx0TmVwqy1rHF1OuFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69729070/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T Mobile may have suffered a customer data breach | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wio2Z"&gt;T-Mobile confirmed Sunday that it’s looking into an online forum post that claims to be selling a large trove of its customers’ sensitive data. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that it was in contact with the seller of the data, who said they had taken data from T-Mobile’s servers that included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver license information related to more than 100 million people. After reviewing samples of the data, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported it appeared authentic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxW1fJ"&gt;“We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity,” a T-Mobile spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not have any additional information to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZBesi"&gt;It’s not clear when the data may have been accessed, but T-Mobile has been the target of several data breaches in the last few years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;most recently in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. During that incident, call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers may have been exposed, but the company said at the time that it did not include more sensitive info such as names or Social Security numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI0mEH"&gt;In 2018, hackers accessed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-data-breach-personal-information-two-million-customers"&gt;personal information for roughly 2 million T-Mobile customers&lt;/a&gt; that included names, addresses, and account numbers, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20978498/tmobile-security-disclosed-breach-prepaid-customers"&gt;2019, some of T-Mobile’s prepaid customers&lt;/a&gt; were affected by a breach that also accessed names, addresses, and account numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHAFjZ"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/pii-notice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21975880__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2020 breach&lt;/a&gt; exposed some T-Mobile customers’ financial information, Social Security numbers, and other account information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First Asian giant hornet (aka murder hornet) sighting of 2021 confirmed in Washington state</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfH9zeAulMcQu8msso-4NIfUpVk=/0x230:587x621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69728625/asian_giant_hornet_attacking_wasp_nest.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Asian giant hornet attacking a paper wasps’ nest is all kinds of nope.  | Washington State Dept. of Agriculture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjQCqG"&gt;The Washington State Department of Agriculture has confirmed the first sighting of a live Asian giant hornet (nickname: murder hornet) in the state this year, the agency said &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=32673"&gt;in a news release.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLu70Q"&gt;Yes I am back on my murder hornet BS. And coincidentally, I am writing this about an hour after a regular-sized (enormous) wasp was prowling around in my kitchen and I had to shoo it outside with a broom handle and a lot of swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1pgf2"&gt;You may recall last year, when many of us were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245617/tldr-murder-hornet-2020"&gt;introduced to the Asian giant hornet&lt;/a&gt; after it was spotted in the US for the first time. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21350034/murder-hornet-asian-washington-state-trap"&gt;WSDA trapped its first specimen&lt;/a&gt; last August, and &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31892"&gt;eradicated its first Asian giant hornet nest&lt;/a&gt; in October. I encourage you to read the news release of that eradication event because it’s incredibly satisfying to read an entomologist hero story. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mPkaEf"&gt;In all, the entomologists with WSDA’s Pest Program removed 98 worker hornets. During the early morning extraction, 85 hornets were vacuumed out of the nest and collected another 13 live hornets were collected with a net while observing the nest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3KcrVb"&gt;Hell yes, entomologists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aswYn8"&gt;The first murder hornet sighting of 2021 in Washington came on August 11th, via a resident of &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VB8WeqeVrBjumPGA9"&gt;Whatcom County&lt;/a&gt;, near the Canadian border. The WSDA confirmed it was an Asian giant hornet a day later, thanks to a photo of the hornet attacking a paper wasp nest in a rural area east of Blaine, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ayfzku"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The murder hornet is the 2020 B-plot you probably didn’t see coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245617/tldr-murder-hornet-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hUbZZL"&gt;“This hornet is exhibiting the same behavior we saw last year — attacking paper wasp nests,” Sven Spichiger, WSDA managing entomologist said in a statement. “If you have paper wasp nests on your property and live in the area, keep an eye on them and report any Asian giant hornets you see. Note the direction they fly off to as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWGAKn"&gt;Yes definitely note the direction they fly off to and then go the other way. Quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyAA50"&gt;Just to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;: a queen Asian giant hornet can grow to be two inches long. The hornets are invasive pests that rip the heads off of honeybees and then feed the bodies to their young. They can fly at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour, and their stingers are long enough to puncture most beekeeping suits. The WSDA says a small group of them can kill an entire honeybee hive “in a matter of hours.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msRVNA"&gt; For comparison (brace yourself): &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mV9DKA6Ek4euW0lXmNOkJg7JW5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19940124/AGHLookalikeCompWithNames_Web1200x1800.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington State Department of Agriculture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c46nHJ"&gt;The WSDA says it will be setting live traps in the area where this nest was discovered, and try to catch a live hornet in order to tag it and track it back to its nest. Canadian officials will be doing the same, since the sighting was so close to the border. According to the WSDA, half of its confirmed reports and all of the Canadian authorities’ reports came from the public, so good job everyone, at least we’re keeping an eye out for them. However, they haven’t caught any live murder hornets in traps so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjldCC"&gt;If you live in Washington state and see what appears to be an Asian giant hornet don’t be a hero; snap a photo and upload it to &lt;a href="http://agr.wa.gov/hornets"&gt;agr.wa.gov/hornets&lt;/a&gt; or email &lt;a href="mailto:hornets@agr.wa.gov"&gt;hornets@agr.wa.gov&lt;/a&gt; (lol the hornets have their own email address) and let the professionals handle things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFAAQ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter unblocks Indian politicians’ accounts after suspending them for violating disclosure law</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has reinstated several Indian politicians’ accounts, after suspending them for a tweet about a child murder.  | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPkrcE"&gt;Twitter has reinstated the accounts of several politicians in India’s opposition party, which were suspended after party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted a photo of himself with the parents of a girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in New Delhi, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-reinstates-accounts-indias-rahul-gandhi-other-opposition-leaders-2021-08-14/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1422779132249788416?s=20"&gt;Gandhi had tweeted his support&lt;/a&gt; of the girl’s family, saying that they deserved justice and others had shared his tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJRBC2"&gt;However, Indian law prohibits the disclosure of the identities of children and sexual assault victims. According to a notice posted on the Lumen database, India’s National Commission for Protection of Child Rights requested Twitter take action. A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Gandhi submitted a copy of an authorization letter from the people in the image to the company’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/report-twitter-abuse-india"&gt;India Grievance Channel&lt;/a&gt;, and his account was reinstated. But the tweet in question, which has been shared more than 15,000 times, will remain withheld in India even though it is visible globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbiyqY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614205/twitter-appoints-grievance-compliance-officer-comply-india-rules"&gt;Twitter appointed its grievance officer&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, to comply with new internet rules in India governing social media platforms. It’s been a bumpy few months between Twitter and India’s government; in June, the government warned the company it could face “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it failed to follow the rules, and in July, India informed Twitter that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;lost its legal immunity for its users’ posts&lt;/a&gt; because of its non-compliance. On August 10th, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619718/twitter-indian-government-internet-it-rules-compliance-grievance-nodal-officer"&gt;government determined that Twitter was in compliance&lt;/a&gt; with the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2viGqA"&gt;Twitter’s moderation policies have also been criticized by Indian officials; police raided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;Twitter’s offices in Delhi and Guragon&lt;/a&gt; in May after the platform labeled a tweet from a government official as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447379/twitter-india-covid19-politician-tweets-manipulated-media"&gt;manipulated media.&lt;/a&gt;” In other instances, however, Twitter has taken action at the government’s request: It suspended more than 500 accounts and reduced the visibility of some hashtags &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, that had with links to widespread farmers’ protest, and has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;censored tweets that criticized India’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 review: flexible flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An improved ThinkPad X1 Yoga with an updated screen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iL0KEf"&gt;Once upon a time, the Thinkpad X1 Yoga was Lenovo’s flagship business convertible, joining the clamshell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226578/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2018-laptop-sixth-generation-windows-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Carbon&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the company’s business hierarchy. These days, it has more company. We now have the paper-thin, titanium-coated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224757/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-carbon-business-laptops-intel"&gt;X1 Titanium Yoga&lt;/a&gt;, the featherweight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;, and the powerhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18019002/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-review-the-right-mix-of-work-and-fun"&gt;X1 Extreme&lt;/a&gt; kicking around, all of which are excellent, pricey, and could reasonably be considered flagships in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yev80s"&gt;There’s a lot of innovation happening across the ThinkPad line, but the X1 Yoga retains a lot of the hallmark features that have graced old-school ThinkPads over the years. (With a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-G6%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1Y6%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting tag of $1,493.40&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630813-REG%2Flenovo_20xy002pus_computer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,315.28 as tested&lt;/a&gt; — that includes the premium price.) There are some subtle but important upgrades, of course, including a 16:10 (finally) touch display, a new gray color, a wider touchpad, and new security features that will mostly appeal to business users. It’s far from the most cost-effective Windows convertible you can buy, but it does have a lot to offer — especially to long-time ThinkPad fans looking for a modern spin on an established package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XwbJgc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10699890"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l3f6tr"&gt;Starting with what’s new: the 16:10 aspect ratio is here. This is a change that Lenovo has brought to other top ThinkPads this year, including the X1 Nano. I much prefer this to the 16:9 panel we saw on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-Gen-5%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1Y5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gen 5&lt;/a&gt;, because it provides noticeably more vertical space without adding much footprint to the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7IrfR"&gt;The other thing to note about this display is its matte texture — you don’t see matte touchscreens very often. Writing on it with the stylus feels basically the same as writing on a glossy panel, though the sound of the tip dragging along is a bit louder on the matte screen. (I also prefer touching the matte texture, though preferences vary.) Mainly, the matte texture makes colors look a bit muted compared to those on glossy screens, but you’ll also see significantly less glare, and work in bright settings is a much more doable prospect. The colors were sharp enough that watching videos was still enjoyable, and I could make out the details well enough, so I found the matte texture to be a positive overall. The panel also didn’t retain any smudges or fingerprints during my testing period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0rii5pBH-yKexE0ZxnouDQX6pTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779116/mchin_210811_4712_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerprint reader and power button in one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 logo on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 seen from above on a stone table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnr7Bp-Hu9GyrnQS5Q0g9_wWPYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779114/mchin_210811_4712_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No fingerprints here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPzkuv"&gt;The other notable change: the touchpad is bigger. Specifically, it’s 4.33 inches wide, where the Gen 5’s (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-5th-gen-2020-review"&gt;much maligned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-5"&gt;by reviewers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-5-review/"&gt;for its&lt;/a&gt; small size) was just four. It is plenty wide now, though it’s still a bit short, and my fingers hit the plastic frame often as I scrolled. If the trackpad is too cramped for you, the X1 Yoga offers you plenty of other ways to click: There’s a set of discrete buttons at the top of the touchpad (though they lack the red accents that often appear on ThinkPad clickers) as well as the signature ThinkPad TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard. And the unit comes with a tiny stylus, which lives in a garage on the right side of the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="4jRDAe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10699900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32IsSK"&gt;And then there are a number of updated security features, which Lenovo has drizzled across the ThinkPad line. There’s an optional IR webcam with human-presence detection which can automatically lock the computer if you’re not nearby (the webcam itself has a physical shutter, as ThinkPads traditionally do, and delivers a fairly grainy picture), a match-on-chip fingerprint reader in the power button, a dTPM 2.0 security chip (which encrypts user data on the system), and an optional feature called Privacy Guard which makes your screen harder to peek at from the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCMu1X"&gt;But the most noticeable update is to the look. While the Gen 5’s chassis had some gray on it, the Gen 6 is gray everywhere, including the keyboard, touchpad, and hinge. This means that the Yoga looks a bit different from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295588/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-p-series-p15-p17-p15v-p1-release-date-price-specs-features"&gt;sea of other ThinkPads out there&lt;/a&gt;, which are traditionally very black. It gives the X1 Yoga more of a futuristic vibe than devices like the X1 Carbon and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147697/lenovo-thinkpad-x-series-t-series-lineup-announce-pricing-release-date"&gt;the X13&lt;/a&gt;, though red and gray aren’t nearly as striking as red and black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7RT6p"&gt;Anyway, to each their own on the aesthetic. What’s slightly disappointing is how easily scratchable the finish was. I folded my unit into a tablet and placed it onto an outdoor table for a few minutes for some brief drawing and writing, and when I picked it up there were scratches on the palm rests. I was afraid to let the device near anything remotely sharp after that. If this was the effect of a few minutes of writing, I worry about how scratched up this chassis could get from daily tablet use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2A106"&gt;Otherwise, I have no complaints about the build quality. There’s a bit of flex in the keyboard deck, but none in the display, and there wasn’t any screen wobble while I was typing or touching the screen. The finish didn’t pick up many fingerprints (an issue I sometimes have with black ThinkPads). The hinge is smooth, making folding and unfolding a breeze — I could pop it open one-handed, with some difficulty. It’s also a fairly portable product, at three pounds and 0.59 inches thick, though a bit heavy to hold as a tablet for long periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPd X1 Yoga Gen 6 half open, angled to the left, seen from behind on a stone bench outdoors." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhK5aYiyNSX8iqrlU3sQVgG-noc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779117/mchin_210811_4712_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aluminum on the top, aluminum on the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Yoga in tablet mode, seen from above, on a stone bench." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zl6J0Y0KRPN32xf7o9qnJF4yD30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779115/mchin_210811_4712_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use it in tablet, tent, stand, or clamshell modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aUe5r5"&gt;Elsewhere, the X1 Yoga is very good. ThinkPad keyboards are world-renowned, and this one — while flatter than those of some of its siblings — is still comfortable with excellent travel. Note that like most ThinkPads, the Yoga has half-sized arrow keys, and the Fn and Ctrl keys swapped from where they are on the majority of other laptops, which takes a lot of getting used to. (You can remap those keys, but having incorrectly labeled keys can still be an eyesore to some.) The port selection is great, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports (a new addition to the X1 Yoga), a USB 3.2 Type-A, and an HDMI 2.0 on the left, as well as a USB 3.2 Type A, a headphone jack, and a lock slot on the right. The four 360-degree microphones did a fine job of picking up my voice. And the Dolby Atmos speaker system sounds great, with audible bass and very clear vocals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9dJrj"&gt;The X1 Yoga Gen 6 has a million and one configurations, with all kinds of add-ons. One interesting thing: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-G6%2Fp%2F20XYCTO1WWENUS1%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cheapest listed model&lt;/a&gt; (currently $1,493.40) is actually a Linux model. The base specs include a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), and 256GB of storage. My test model (running Windows 10 Pro, not Linux) is listed at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630813-REG%2Flenovo_20xy002pus_computer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,315.28 at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; and includes a quad-core Core i7-1165G7, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1HokC"&gt;Then there are the various extras. Windows 10 Pro will cost you $60 more than Windows 10 Home. You can bump up to a 3840 x 2400 screen, or a 1920 x 1200 screen with Privacy Guard. Both of these options are only available with the IR camera, which is $30 over the regular camera. Human Presence Detection, also only available with the IR camera, is an extra $15. And you can add 4G and 5G mobile broadband; prices vary depending on the modem you select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 open on a stone bench seen from above. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with an orange banner rippling through and the Lenovo banner on the bottom right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBm389xUS6rM1XKy5zDiDT7W_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779118/mchin_210811_4712_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See those scratches on the clickers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbXikR"&gt;The Core i7 utilized here is the same processor found in many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market and is enough for all kinds of demanding workloads. Intel’s Iris Xe graphics card can lend a hand with work tasks and lighter gaming, though the X1 Yoga isn’t a gaming laptop by any stretch. Apps launched quickly, and I didn’t notice much stuttering or slowdown during my day full of streaming, photo editing, and Slacking on top of around a dozen Chrome tabs. Performance does depend somewhat on your battery profile more than with other Windows laptops — I had to switch off of Battery Saver when I was trying to run a Zoom call on top of a heap of tabs and apps because everything started freezing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esOlrk"&gt;Speaking of battery, the X1 Yoga’s life span isn’t a disaster but was still just fine for a convertible at this price point. I averaged eight hours and seven minutes of continuous use with the screen at medium brightness. That’s not a bad result, but I’ve seen better from the top ultraportables at this level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCiomq"&gt;The final observation — which I’m probably a bit too happy about — is that there’s no bloatware on this thing. No McAfee, no Norton, no nonsense that I had to uninstall as soon as I turned it on. I generally hope that laptops above the $1,000 mark won’t come loaded with this stuff, but I regularly see them on pricey consumer laptops from all kinds of companies (including Lenovo). I’m glad that the ThinkPad isn’t loaded with any junk, but consumers should get this experience, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 in easel mode angled to the left on a stone outdoor bench. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with an orange banner rippling through and the Lenovo banner on the bottom right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmIz4gzxrst-lJY0PR5nYS0N0Fg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779120/mchin_210811_4712_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloatware-free zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMq79"&gt;With so many add-ons and configurations, and prices ranging from $1,500 to over $3,000, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga can really be what you make it. It can be a midrange convertible with basic specs, or it can be a premium business laptop with the security emphasis characteristic of the ThinkPad line. Among the saturated sea of convertible ThinkPads out there, it’s absolutely one to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN0y6p"&gt;With that said, it’s quite a pricey line for a consumer or self-employed worker. For context, you can get a comparable model of Lenovo’s top consumer convertible, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;Yoga 9i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FYoga-9-14ITL5%2Fp%2F82BGCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $1,529&lt;/a&gt; — which even has the Core i7-1185G7, a step above the chip that came with my test model. X1 Yoga models with that processor start at $1,938. Like the X1 Yoga, the Yoga 9i has a convertible form factor, a physical webcam shutter, a built-in stylus, a one-year warranty, and most of the same software from Lenovo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abv5Fo"&gt;That raises the question of what all that extra money is really paying for. The X1 Yoga’s 16:10 aspect ratio is certainly a bonus, as are the lack of bloatware and the matte display. On the other hand, the 9i has better battery life (as do many consumer convertibles at that price), exceptional audio, and some truly innovative features like a haptic touchpad and an ultrasonic fingerprint reader. At a certain point, X1 Yoga buyers are really paying a premium for the ThinkPad build. ThinkPads have some unique aspects — their TrackPoint and the unique keyboard arrangement will always have their devotees — but they also have a sleek, professional look and feel. They’re known for their extreme durability (and the X1 Yoga is MIL-spec tested, though the X1 Yoga’s scratch-prone chassis and the flex in its keyboard gives me some pause on that front). Overall, like the MacBook’s bitten apple, the ThinkPad logo is a graphic anyone will recognize. It’s associated with a high level of build quality, longevity, and performance — it commands a certain status among business users and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AjX25r"&gt;Which is all well and good, if that’s what you want. If you’re looking for a modern ThinkPad that’s competitive with today’s best laptops, and especially if you’re interested in tidbits like Linux and human presence detection, this is probably your dream machine. I just feel obligated to note that if you’re so-so on the ThinkPad branding, you can get most of what this offers for much cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jury decides Apple should pay $300 million in patent dispute</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gSIul"&gt;Apple must pay $300 million in royalties following a retrial in a patent dispute, a Texas jury determined Friday. As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/jury-awards-optis-300-million-second-patent-trial-against-apple-2021-08-13/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the jury found that Apple should pay patent company Optis Wireless Technology and its related companies because the technology Apple used in its iPhones, iPads, and Watches allegedly infringed Optis’ patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPd4m"&gt;Last year, a jury &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-told-to-pay-506-million-in-texas-patent-trial-verdict-1"&gt;awarded Optis $506 million&lt;/a&gt; in the dispute, but a judge vacated that award in April, and ordered a new trial focused on damages only. US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury had not been allowed to consider whether the amount was awarded on the “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory,” or FRAND, terms required in standard-essential patent cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krgeS3"&gt;The five patents involved in the case once belonged to LG, Panasonic, and Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/14/apple_google_patents/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, but were obtained by Optis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RcXsO"&gt;An Apple spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday that the company was disappointed by the verdict and plans to appeal. “Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate,” the spokesperson wrote. “We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzv9dF"&gt;Last month &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; record third-quarter revenue of $81.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjHqaD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 15th 12:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from Apple spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford asks court to dismiss GM’s lawsuit over “BlueCruise” driver assist feature</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLoa4K"&gt;Ford has filed a motion asking the US District Court in San Francisco to dismiss a lawsuit from rival GM over Ford’s BlueCruise self-driving feature. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591805/gm-cruise-lawsuit-trademark-infringement-hands-free-driving-autonomous"&gt;GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the name BlueCruise was too close to Super Cruise, the name of GM’s hands-free driving tech, which it introduced in 2017, as well as its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbysi7"&gt;Ford said in its motion that the term “cruise” has been been in “ubiquitous use” over the past 50 years to refer to driver-assist features. “Consumers understand “cruise” to refer to a feature in their vehicle that performs part of the driving task or assists them in driving, and they do not associate that term with any one company or brand,” Ford argued in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42W8Mp"&gt;In its lawsuit filed July 23rd, GM said the two the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to come to agreement. “Ford knew exactly what it was doing,” GM alleged in its complaint, adding that if Ford “wanted to adopt a new, unique brand, it easily could have done so without using the word ‘Cruise.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ6AWb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist feature in April, and said it would begin pushing the feature via an over-the-air software update to select vehicles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXvDjy"&gt;A spokesperson for Ford said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday that the company considered GM’s trademark claims “meritless and frivolous,” adding that for decades drivers “have understood what cruise control is, every automaker offers it, and ‘cruise’ is common shorthand” for such features. In addition to seeking to have GM’s case thrown out, Ford has petitioned the US Patent and Trademark Office to rescind GM’s trademark of “Cruise” and “Super Cruise,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLGqQG"&gt;GM did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s controversial plan to try to curb child sexual abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6z3Ld4HzH_dTWyXO8gjMRz1XVXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725913/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple ‘s plan to scan iOS devices for CSAM imagery has proven controversial | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why privacy experts are concerned&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dc6dr1"&gt;When Apple announced changes it plans to make to iOS devices in an effort to help curb child abuse by finding child sexual abuse material (CSAM), parts of its plan generated backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twOtsC"&gt;First, it’s rolling out an update to its Search app and Siri voice assistant on iOS 15, watchOS 8, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey. When a user searches for topics related to child sexual abuse, Apple will redirect the user to resources for reporting CSAM, or getting help for an attraction to such content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Jhnc4"&gt;But it’s Apple’s two other CSAM plans that have garnered criticism. One update will add a parental control option to Messages, sending an alert to parents if a child age 12 or younger views or sends sexually explicit pictures, and obscuring the images for any users under 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhX8SA"&gt;The one that’s proven most controversial is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple’s plan to scan on-device images to find CSAM&lt;/a&gt; before they images are uploaded to iCloud, reporting them to Apple’s moderators who can then turn the images over to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the case of a potential match. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple says the feature will protect users&lt;/a&gt; while allowing the company to find illegal content, many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;Apple critics and privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt; say the provision is basically a security backdoor, an apparent contradiction to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;Apple’s long-professed commitment to user privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh7kyv"&gt;To stay up to speed on the latest news about Apple’s CSAM protection plans, follow our storystream, which we’ll update whenever there’s a new development.

    <title>Go read this story of tech workers who secretly work multiple remote jobs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Home Office" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWpN_SgkIvCRwz8VHInM3KUDPhs=/549x0:5499x3300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725456/1230667805.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Some workers use remote jobs to juggle multiple employers | Photo by Fabian Strauch/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkhjVp"&gt;For journalists and others in creative and technical fields, having a side hustle or doing freelance work is extremely common. In addition to a day job an editor, for example, one may write paid-per-piece articles for other publications who aren’t competitors of her primary employer, and typically (ideally) with her employer’s explicit or tacit approval. Some people do so for the needed additional income, some like the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="actdTW"&gt;And according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-people-who-work-from-home-have-a-secret-they-have-two-jobs-11628866529"&gt;story in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; a new &lt;a href="https://overemployed.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; provides tips for tech workers who want to earn two full-time paychecks while working remotely, giving half-assed effort to one (or both) and without letting either employer know about the other. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; describes the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vQRqVd"&gt;Alone in their home offices, they toggle between two laptops. They play “Tetris” with their calendars, trying to dodge endless meetings. Sometimes they log on to two meetings at once. They use paid time off—in some cases, unlimited—to juggle the occasional big project or ramp up at a new gig. Many say they don’t work more than 40 hours a week for both jobs combined. They don’t apologize for taking advantage of a system they feel has taken advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dwqvTN"&gt;The workers who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; (anonymously) seem to go to great lengths to work for two companies simultaneously; from keeping extremely organized calendars, to juggling overlapping Zoom calls and project deadlines. And while it’s not necessarily illegal to work for more than one company, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports, such arrangements may run afoul of employment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS9b9n"&gt;There’s no doubt that many employers are reaping what they’ve sown with workers across the employment spectrum; along with a lack of job security and meager paychecks, workers are dealing with a pandemic that has upended home and work life for everyone. The thing that bugged me in this piece was how some of the workers talked about gaming the system by lying about what are valid reasons someone would need accommodation from their employer: They use their unlimited PTO for a month off and cite “COVID-19 burnout,” or skip out of double-booked meetings by taking “an imaginary call from a child’s school.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIrsMK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-people-who-work-from-home-have-a-secret-they-have-two-jobs-11628866529"&gt;Go read this very interesting &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; about what it’s like to juggle remote jobs, and how people claim to get away with it. &lt;/p&gt;
