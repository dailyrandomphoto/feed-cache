The animated &lt;em&gt;What If...?, &lt;/em&gt;featuring alternative takes on the existing Marvel movie heroes and stories, will arrive on Disney Plus on August 11th and run for 10 weeks through October 13th. Marvel Studios has also yet to announce a release date for &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, which will introduce the popular teenage superhero Kamala Khan to the MCU at some point in “late 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EE6HT"&gt;That’s in addition to Marvel’s theatrical releases for the rest of the year, including &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; on September 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; on November 5th, and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; on December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric boat startup Arc wants to make a big splash </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E17kW2gJHlJ4rr5yS2qN1GcdWEM=/196x0:2305x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650596/Arc_One___Dark_Side_View.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Arc&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DLPxtz"&gt;Electricity and water don’t mix — well, actually, they mix &lt;em&gt;really well&lt;/em&gt;, which can be problematic for humans. So the thought of an electric boat may seem risky. A new California startup called Arc is going to try to shred that perception, starting with a limited edition 24-foot watersports boat that will cost around $300,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnwhib"&gt;That’s an incredible amount of money. But Arc — which is coming out of stealth mode today, boasts a handful of SpaceX expats, and is backed by Silicon Valley powerhouse firm Andreessen Horowitz — plans to work its way down from that price point once it’s producing and selling boats, just like Tesla once did for electric passenger cars with the Roadster, followed by the Model S and X, and then the Model 3 and Y. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NV7Mnp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are using [Tesla’s] playbook almost verbatim.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VLnfxJ"&gt;Electric boats have far fewer moving parts, meaning that they &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;deal a big blow to maintenance costs, one of the biggest headaches of owning a boat. What’s more, electricity can be much cheaper than marina fuel prices, and trickle charging a boat at home makes far more sense than doing it with a car. While Arc’s first boat may not reach total parity with a gas-powered boat, that’s the goal, and Arc CEO Mitch Lee thinks it’s readily attainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoVXuS"&gt;“We are starting up-market, we are working our way down as quickly as we can — we are using their playbook almost verbatim,” Lee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview.  In other words, the limited sales of the $300,000 Arc One boat will help finance the R&amp;amp;D required to make a more affordable version of that Arc, one that could sell “in the thousands,” Lee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkuQ9K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10675353"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPF3S9"&gt;Running Tesla’s playbook while also trying to disrupt the boating world with electric propulsion technology makes it easy to collar Arc with the “Tesla for boats” moniker. Arc wouldn’t be the first, and it won’t be the last, but Lee says he’d rather leave that decision up to the media and the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01e3IK"&gt;“From a branding person, why I hesitate is everyone is going to call themselves the ‘Tesla for boats.’ It’s like, everyone aspires to that,” he says. “What matters is how well are you executing against that playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9e13S"&gt;Arc’s first boat is simple, but something of a marvel — at least on paper. (Lee says Arc has one prototype already.) The boat will have a 200kWh, 800-volt battery pack — roughly double the capacity and voltage of Tesla’s current top-tier pack — and an electric motor with at least 475 horsepower, Lee says. It will have a top speed of around 40 miles per hour and run for a total of around four hours, which Lee says should cover a day’s worth of boating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Upl7Fr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 200kWh, 800-volt battery pack, and 475 horsepower on tap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lIBDeW"&gt;Better yet, Lee says, the boat will throw a wake behind it, meaning it will be fun to use for wake sports like waterskiing. This is rare in the nascent electric boat market, Lee says, because it takes a lot of energy to move through water, so other companies have looked to reduce the forces that create a wake. Some are using a hydrofoil to reduce drag, basically eliminating the wake altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15JtsF"&gt;This is a big reason why the battery pack will be so energy-dense. “When you’re moving through water, power draw is cubic to your speed,” Lee says. “If you want a boat that can go 40 miles an hour, you need a very large battery to be able to handle that.” All that extra energy on tap will help the boat “plane” at higher speeds, too, which is when it essentially skims across the water, reducing drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax1QUx"&gt;“Boats are actually really good at floating — that sounds silly but like it’s not hard to make a boat that could carry a huge load,” Lee says. “The hard part is if you want to plane, or you want to move quickly. [That creates] this exponential power draw, because you’re moving through something much more viscous than air.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iNslx"&gt;Another key part of Arc’s design is that it’s building aluminum hulls. Much like when Ford adopted aluminum for its pickup trucks half a decade ago, Arc is bucking convention here. Most boat hulls in this class are made out of carbon fiber or some other type of composite material. Lee says aluminum will be less labor intensive, less expensive, while still being light enough that Arc can commit most of the weight to the battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrLk46"&gt;While the pack will be big, it will be spread across the bottom of the boat and integrated into the structure of the hull — something that will inevitably draw more comparisons to Tesla, which is working on structural battery packs for its future vehicles. Also like Tesla, Lee says Arc is going for a high degree of vertical integration. In addition to the hull, the startup is designing its own enclosures for the battery packs, as well as the cooling system. It’s developing the software, too, which it plans to tweak and improve via over-the-air updates. Arc &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; sourcing the modules and cells that make up the pack, and the electric motor (Lee declined to name the suppliers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r93MIR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arc is bucking a lot of conventions and promising a simpler ownership experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="29PsqC"&gt;Arc is also pulling in some outside consultants to help with the 800-volt technology since that’s something that is still rare even in the world of high-performance electric vehicles. (Porsche has an 800-volt pack in the Taycan, and GM is working on 800-volt battery packs for its Ultium-powered EVs.) Again, Lee cautions, that doesn’t mean there’s reason to be worried. There’s precedence for high-voltage electrical systems on boats, though they often power the so-called “hotel loads” — basically all the creature comforts not related to propulsion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOlwCn"&gt;“We are novel in that this is going to be our powertrain — we’re using these high voltage batteries for this particular usage,” he says. “Our entire team is dedicated to making sure that we are doing this intelligently and safely. So there are some extra closeouts that we’re doing and the testing process we’re using is ridiculously rigorous, to make sure that we’re bringing this system online safely.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byn1du"&gt;Ultimately, Lee believes the massive theoretical upside of an electric boat will transcend any wariness about what’s powering it. He’s so bullish on the idea that he says he hopes to one day get Arc’s boats to require &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; maintenance. (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1419571113076695040"&gt;Sound familiar&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7y7fT"&gt;“Boating is amazing. Boat ownership is awful, and we want to solve all the awful parts about boat ownership, and expand the boating market,” he says. “If we make a boat that, yes, is premium to the market, but it lowers the headache of boat ownership and amplifies the magic of being out on the water... I think that’s a big selling point for us. And if you kind of pair that with all the macro trends of everything going electric, all of that I think sets us up for the right product, the right market fit, the right time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjmZHS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s live TV service gets NFL Network and RedZone ahead of 2021 season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NsQ-SJpNlGcRSpymUDegFIa8dNw=/250x0:1600x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650582/image001.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new sports add-on from Hulu with Live TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Hulu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pAhwS2"&gt;Hulu is adding two big channels for football coverage to its live TV service. The NFL Network will be included in Hulu’s live TV package beginning today at no extra cost, while NFL RedZone will now be offered as part of a new sports add-on. The add-on includes a half-dozen channels, but subscribers will have to pony up for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izPHxB"&gt;The NFL Network joins the more than 75 live TV channels already available as part of Hulu’s live TV package, which starts at $65 per month. The channel includes studio coverage, original series, live NFL season games, as well as NFL preseason games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XUPbtQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The NFL says broadening distribution is among its “top priorities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nPkPKU"&gt;Hulu’s new sports add-on package can expand those channels with NFL RedZone in addition to MAVTV Motorsports Network, Outdoor Channel, Sportsman Channel, TVG, and TVG2. The add-on sports programming costs an extra $10 per month on top of what you’re already paying for Hulu’s live TV service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4Sb1J"&gt;For context, YouTube TV has a similar sports package that costs $11 per month. Sling TV and FuboTV both charge an additional $11 per month for access to RedZone as well, though included channels in their respective add-on sports packages vary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMcK1D"&gt;One of the National Football League’s “top priorities” is “broadening the distribution platforms for NFL content,” Hans Schroeder, EVP and COO of NFL Media, said in a statement, “and so we’re very pleased to bring our lineup of award-winning shows and live games to Hulu’s live subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4meDY"&gt;The addition of NFL RedZone to Hulu was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396233/nfl-redzone-network-hulu-live-tv-service-2021-season"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; in April. Previously, Hulu subscribers who wanted more sports channels could &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/espn-addon"&gt;subscribe to ESPN Plus&lt;/a&gt; and access its content directly through the Hulu app. But Hulu lacked a formal sports add-on; its add-ons before the update were &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/what-is-hulu-live-tv"&gt;limited to&lt;/a&gt; entertainment, Spanish-language content, various premium channels like Starz or HBO, and features like unlimited screens and enhanced DVR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woVpwU"&gt;Hulu also offers sports coverage through channels like ESPN, ESPN 2, Fox, Fox’s FS1 and FS2 channels, CBS Sports Network, NBC Sports Network, the Olympic Channel, and more in its base package.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook review: midrange done right</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Flex 5 is built for its price range&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UD2gjV"&gt;Currently available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Chromebook-i3-10110U-Integrated-82B80006UX/dp/B086383HC7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;less than $400&lt;/a&gt;, the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook is a pretty dang good deal. You get Intel’s capable 10th Gen processors, a sturdy and nice-looking chassis, a touchscreen with stylus support, a comfortable backlit keyboard, and a satisfactory port selection. While there’s no standout feature to enthusiastically praise, there’s not too much to complain about. That’s enough, of course, to make the Flex 5 one of the best midrange Chromebooks you can buy — as long as you’re aware of the tradeoffs you’re making for the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f0eaPO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10674572"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="x2nZ4L"&gt;First, the good. The Flex 5 has a much nicer chassis than many other Chromebooks you’ll see in this price range — it’s actually one of the better-built Chromebooks I’ve used this year. Though the bottom is made of plastic, it’s far from the cheap-looking fare that’s commonplace among budget laptops. (No huge plastic bezels around the screen either.) The keyboard deck has a soft-touch texture that’s quite smooth and doesn’t pick up a ton of fingerprints despite its dark color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9p2kU"&gt;As a consequence, the device looks a lot better than your average laptop-cart Chromebook. It certainly looks more modern than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer’s $699 Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, our current pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;. And I wasn’t at all worried about jostles and jolts — there was no flex in the screen and very little in the keyboard. In addition to the solid build, the Flex 5 has a reasonable port selection including two USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1, one USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1, a combo audio jack, a microSD reader, and a Kensington lock. Bonus points: there’s a USB-C port on each side for convenient charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZp61H"&gt;It is, however, a bit on the large side as 13-inch Chromebooks go, at 0.7 inches thick and a weight just under three pounds. (It’s just slightly lighter than the Spin 713.) That makes it a bit heavy to hold as a tablet for long periods of time, and you’ll want something smaller if you’re looking for a device you won’t notice in your backpack. Still, it’s quite portable, and far from anything I’d describe as heavy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook open, angled to the left. The screen displays a blue wavy background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7hTnlm1gVC9-BNKtlHezYK0ICqQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745646/mchin_210727_4682_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use it in laptop, tent, stand, or tablet modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8xNJ2a"&gt;The keyboard is a highlight of this device for me. The keys are backlit (not a guarantee at this price point) and look sleek against the black deck. It’s comfortable, with 1.4mm of travel, without being too loud. The touchpad is also an easy click and quite accurate, though it’s on the rough side texture-wise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fo7nI8"&gt;The 1920 x 1080 display is crisp and vivid. It also has stylus support, though a pen isn’t included. It is noticeably blurrier than the Spin 713’s higher-resolution panel, however. It’s also not the brightest screen around, maxing out at 250 nits, and I did see glare here and there while I was working during the day. And I’m not a fan of its 16:9 aspect ratio — Chromebooks that use 3:2 or 16:10 displays are able to cram noticeably more screen real estate into a smaller chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook in tent mode, angled to the left. The screen displays a grid of Chrome OS icons on a blue wavy background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3DqeHN6p6mKczVNtZ4Jb6ywtmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745644/mchin_210727_4682_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glossy IPS finish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook half open seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yYMdjNjPDCxGZlOjlzntTsC2O9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745648/mchin_210727_4682_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, USB-A, audio jack, microSD on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook half open, seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZvNOwzk2WUpFBGbTzniU54fRirE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745647/mchin_210727_4682_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lock slot, USB-C on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B693lI"&gt;The 720p webcam is surprisingly usable. It delivers a picture that’s grainy but accurate, even in low-light settings. There’s a physical shutter, though it’s very tiny and hard to see. I couldn’t make it out unless I leaned very close to the webcam, and generally just felt around for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mfwsi8"&gt;If you’ll be making a lot of video calls, though, you should note that the audio isn’t great. Sound comes from two 2W front-facing speakers on either side of the keyboard. My songs got loud enough, but everything aside from vocals (and especially the percussion) was thin and tinny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="jPaxi5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10674594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="v0m9Fi"&gt;My Flex 5 review unit has an Intel Core i3-10110U, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of eMMC storage. (Per Amazon, its MSRP is $429.99, but it’s currently listed at $341.95.) The base model, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Fstudent-chromebooks%2FIdeaPad-F5-CB-13CML-05%2Fp%2F88IPFC51448&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22598860%2Flenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently listed at $334.99&lt;/a&gt;, has an Intel Celeron 5205U processor (which is likely to be slow) and 32GB of storage, and the top $564.99 model has the Core i3 as well as 128GB of PCIe SSD storage (which should be much faster than eMMC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcePyw"&gt;I was surprised by how well my Flex 5 unit performed. The Core i3 flies. I saw no visible sluggishness or slowdown, even when I was running multiple programs like Adobe Lightroom and Google Photos on top of a heavy load of Chrome tabs and Android apps. The experience wasn’t noticeably different from that of using the Spin 713 with a Core i5 and an SSD (though it may make a difference for you if you’re running Linux or using heavier apps). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Flex 5 seen from the back, open, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TohOGrwoXfOR2T-gPEWhvTjUeWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745645/mchin_210727_4682_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid picked up a few more fingerprints than the deck did, but kept them at bay overall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yqfAH4"&gt;Chrome OS ran just fine on this device. Features like multiple sign-in (which allows you to switch between two accounts without signing in and out) and tablet mode (which has Android-esque gestures for easily switching between windows and apps while you’re using the Flex as a tablet) didn’t give me any trouble. Most of the apps I usually use (primarily Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, and Notepad) are serviceable these days on Chrome OS, though they still don’t offer a ton of benefit over their browser counterparts. Strangely, Slack — the Android app I complain about the most — was not available for this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3M4tbl"&gt;The Flex 5’s fans were usually running during my usual multitasking work (generally utilizing around a dozen Chrome tabs and an app or two). They were quiet enough that it wasn’t bothersome, but I did hear them (alongside some tiny coil whine) if I put my ear to the keyboard. Fortunately, they succeeded in keeping the chassis cool — the bottom was often toasty, but never so hot that I couldn’t keep the device on my lap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olLzDC"&gt;Battery life, however, was a disappointment. I averaged just over five and a half hours of consistent work with the screen at 50 percent brightness, running some trials with a bunch of Android apps and some just with Chrome. That’s the worst result I’ve seen from any recent Chromebook — the Spin 713 averaged seven hours and 29 minutes, and that still wasn’t a great result for the category. The Flex also took a while to charge. The 45W adapter took an hour to juice the laptop’s battery up to just 54 percent with light Chrome use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Intel Core i3 sticker up close on the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RXJmdW7GvANokoEiVLNOIzErG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745650/mchin_210727_4682_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wish the Core i3 was a bit more efficient here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rZ5xgK"&gt;Many of the sentences in this review have had “but” at the end. That’s because almost everything about the Flex 5 is acceptable... with some caveats. And that’s a fair way to describe my feelings about this Chromebook: acceptable with caveats. For a maximum of $429.99, that’s enough to earn it my recommendation as a solid midrange purchase — especially since it handles my workload as well as any premium Chromebook I’ve tested recently without frying itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdwQaS"&gt;To put into perspective how low that price is: the Core i3 model of the Chromebook Spin 713 (with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage) &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.officedepot.com%2Fa%2Fproducts%2F9620742%2FAcer-CP713-2W-CP713-2W-38P1%2F%3Fcm_mmc%3DAffiliates-_-CJ-_-3691842-_-13474833%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3Dna_prch_na%26cjevent%3D4e457e0af07f11eb82b01f9d0a82b820%26siteid%3DCJ_13474833_5735146_s16275714479748piea52402%26utm_source%3Dcj%26utm_campaign%3DODOMX%2520Google%2520Feed_Hatch%2520BV&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22598860%2Flenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $699.99&lt;/a&gt; — a minimum of $270 more. The cheapest model of the HP Envy x360 13 (our top budget Windows laptop), with an AMD Ryzen 5 chip as well as 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619562324%26quantity%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22598860%2Flenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is currently listed for the same amount&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these devices have decisive advantages, of course. The Spin 713 has a higher-resolution 3:2 display and Thunderbolt 4 support as well as the extra storage, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Envy x360&lt;/a&gt; has an unbelievable processor with decent audio and good battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The bottom right corner of the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJE_RrvNt0TgT1ZYfdym-BCKfaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745649/mchin_210727_4682_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A good midrange Chromebook, but not a great one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmvako"&gt;The most significant benefit most people will get from the extra money is extra battery life and storage — but better displays (especially the Spin’s 3:2 aspect ratio), better speakers, and better ports will be a big help to some users as well. But if you’re wed to the sub-$500 price point, you’re unlikely to find better build quality, with a better keyboard and a better port selection, than the Flex 5, in either the Chromebook or Windows spheres. Premium Chromebooks with chassis to rival those of premium Windows laptops have been on the rise for a few years now, and it’s nice to see that trend extending to lower-priced devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite teases concert series with ‘record-breaking superstar’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0YbpdPk_mGiwovKAZxmVdcfS0w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650412/en_17br_rifttour_announce_02_social_1920x1080_5b4f459e74fc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h1XhRD"&gt;The next big &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert is happening very soon — but who will be performing remains a mystery. Developer Epic &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-rift-tour"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; an event called the Rift Tour, which will take place from August 6th to the 8th, with a series of events across different time zones. It’s described as “a musical journey into magical new realities where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and a record-breaking superstar collide.” Epic previously teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595880/fortnite-alien-event-date-chapter-2-season-7"&gt;an alien-themed event&lt;/a&gt; happening on August 6th with an in-game countdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE66zF"&gt;Who that superstar is remains to be seen. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;Recent rumors&lt;/a&gt; suggest that Ariana Grande could be the next performer to take &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s virtual stage. She would join the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; performances have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;some of the most popular in-game events to date&lt;/a&gt;. Epic says that “we’ll be sharing more big news on the Rift Tour” on August 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGFZZU"&gt;In the meantime, starting today there are a series of in-game challenges — one of which involves visiting a “party UFO” — where players can unlock concert-related freebies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb’s new tool makes it easier for hosts to list Wi-Fi speeds for remote work getaways</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bsscWF3CzQrinBs5MQ-zlMqaXk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650314/Airbnb_Logo_Over_Gradient.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eG3iXu"&gt;Airbnb is &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/new-tool-check-the-wifi-speed-in-your-airbnb-listing-before-you-book/"&gt;adding a new tool for hosts&lt;/a&gt; that will let them easily test and list their Wi-Fi speeds on listings. The new addition is in recognization of the fact that — particularly with the current remote work and school model — customers are renting Airbnb properties not just for vacations but for working trips that provide a change of scenery. In that vein, knowing that you’ll actually be able to have strong internet when you’re booking is a useful feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6N7Bm"&gt;While it’s been possible for hosts to list Wi-Fi speeds or share screenshots of speed tests before, the new tool is &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2F3003%2Fverify-your-internet-speed&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;integrated directly into Airbnb’s app&lt;/a&gt; (using &lt;a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/"&gt;M-Lab’s open-source software&lt;/a&gt;) and allows for Wi-Fi speed to be displayed directly on a listing alongside other information about a property.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1y5dHHYjBCQFcZXswM8LeYBtZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748230/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_10.24.37_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hlHYCi"&gt;And by utilizing a standardized test that’s built into its app, Airbnb can help make sure that customers will actually be getting an accurate picture of what to expect at the property: hosts can only display the results that the Airbnb app’s speed test actually finds, instead of inflating or rounding up numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c80phD"&gt;The new speed test feature is rolling out now in the US and will expand globally “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jodie Whittaker’s run on Doctor Who will end in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47nc7WafCxH7MhnRQPgBqnhJS3A=/57x0:672x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650300/2g90j0k80001000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1YBZ4o"&gt;The Thirteenth Doctor is set to step away. Today, the BBC announced that Jodie Whittaker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/16/15973556/jodie-whittaker-bbc-doctor-who-thirteenth-series-eleven-2018-tardis"&gt;who took over as the first female lead in Doctor Who in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, will end her run on the show in 2022. Showrunner Chris Chibnall will also be leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ORFIV"&gt;“My heart is so full of love for this show, for the team who make it, for the fans who watch it and for what it has brought to my life,” &lt;a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=jodie-whittaker-chris-chibnall-leave-doctor-who#_"&gt;Whittaker said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “And I cannot thank Chris enough for entrusting me with his incredible stories. We knew that we wanted to ride this wave side by side, and pass on the baton together. So here we are, weeks away from wrapping on the best job I have ever had. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to express what this role has given me. I will carry the Doctor and the lessons I’ve learnt forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="79K2Ml"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My heart is so full of love for this show.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg2eUw"&gt;That said, there’s still plenty of Whittaker-led &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; in store between now and then. At SDCC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/25/22593232/doctor-who-series-13-teaser-trailer-story"&gt;it was revealed that the show’s delayed Series 13 would tell a single story&lt;/a&gt;; it’s expected to debut later this year, though there’s no specific date yet. In addition to that, there are two specials planned for 2022, and the BBC said today that the broadcaster “has now asked for an additional final feature length adventure for the Thirteenth Doctor, to form a trio of specials for 2022, before the Doctor regenerates once more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jveEZW"&gt;Now comes one of the most exciting parts of being a &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; fan: speculating who will take over next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airports have a wildlife problem (and vice versa) </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUf2cQuNQFE8NbdmEAi-VURlhUY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650024/VRG_SCI_207_AirportWildlife_v5.01_06_27_22.Still020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvslAz"&gt;Every summer, hundreds of diamondback terrapins crawl over to New York’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;John F. Kennedy International Airport to lay their eggs. In past years, the turtles have been so obstructive, they’ve caused &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/turtles-turn-jfk-air-traffic-crawl/story?id=13957355"&gt;flight delays&lt;/a&gt;. To manage situations like these, airports&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like JFK&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have entire departments dedicated to keeping wildlife and planes out of each other’s way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0gqhl"&gt;While keeping the tarmac clear of turtles allows airports to operate smoothly, the real danger looms in the skies. On average, over 10,000 wildlife strikes are reported each year to the Federal Aviation Administration, most of them birds. As more planes take to the skies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the number of bird strikes has&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wildlife.faa.gov/home"&gt;trended upward&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;threatening to damage planes, or worse, cause catastrophic engine failure during takeoff, like the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR1003.pdf"&gt;American Airlines Flight 1549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3lw1d"&gt;To keep interactions between planes and wildlife&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from turning deadly, specialists employ a range of tactics from habitat management to sequencing bird DNA. But can they keep up with the pace of travel? &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;joined a wildlife biologist on the runway at JFK, and an expert in feather forensics at the Smithsonian, to find out. Check out our latest video to see what we found — and learn what the word “&lt;em&gt;snarge&lt;/em&gt;” means.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the PS5’s M.2 SSD expandable storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m6g0PyyXCb4yHzBhx98T53vBM5Y=/6x0:1994x1325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650005/ps5ssd1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 software beta now supports M.2 SSDs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EqbNni"&gt;Sony has started beta testing the first software update for the PS5 today, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;includes M.2 SSD expandable storage support&lt;/a&gt;. The long-awaited feature is available for testers right now and will launch on all PS5 consoles later this year. We’ll need to test a variety of drives with the PS5, but right now Sony requires at least a PCIe Gen4 SSD, with a minimum capacity of 250GB. Sony is also recommending a drive capable of 5,500MB/s, but slower Gen4 drives may still be supported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLcFL2"&gt;I’ve tested Corsair’s Force MP600 (2TB) with the PS5, which has lower read speeds (4,950MB/s) than Sony recommends, and it’s very easy to get it all up and running in less than two minutes. Here’s how it all works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ctqldW"&gt;To use the expandable storage in the PS5, you’ll need to remove the side panels from the console. Make sure you’ve unplugged the power cord, and then follow this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHZugP--N8Q"&gt;really useful YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; on how to remove the side panels correctly. It’s a little fiddly, but the PS5 is sturdy, so don’t worry you’re not going to snap the panels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LysnTI"&gt;Once you’ve removed both panels, you need to locate the M.2 SSD slot. It’s on the left-hand side of the fan; that’s on the side where the PS5’s disc drive resides. You’ll need a screwdriver to unscrew the cover on the M.2 SSD slot, and to remove a screw that fixes your drive into place. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s M.2 SSD slot has a screw to fix your drive into place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zeAaai"&gt;Once the cover has been removed, you’ll find a black screw that Sony has supplied at the very top inside the slot. Unscrew this and use it to hold your SSD into place. Sony recommends using an M.2 SSD with a heatsink, so if you’ve purchased a Gen4 one without one, there are a variety of heatsinks you can purchase to affix to SSDs that will help with cooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vMKAy3"&gt;Now that the M.2 SSD is in place, you can put the cover back on the slot and then gently slide the side panels back into place on either side. Reconnect the power cord, and boot up your PS5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-pUtS16ODVV1WvJqvxenGHAyRcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748004/photo1627558599.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your SSD isn’t compatible, you’ll get this message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vi3lgH"&gt;If your M.2 SSD isn’t compatible, you’ll be met with a warning from your PS5 that you need a Gen4 drive with at least 256GB of space. Otherwise, you’ll need to go ahead and format the drive for use on the PS5. Make sure you’ve backed up any data on the drive if you’ve been using it in other systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tRftou"&gt;Formatting took less than 10 seconds on my Corsair Force MP600 (2TB) drive. Once formatting has been completed, the PS5 will quickly test the drive speed and warn you that if you have issues with a game installed on the M.2 SSD, try moving it to the internal storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="F0ii6C"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="PS5 M.2 SSD support|103227" data-volume-uuid="0b152b0a2" data-volume-id="103227" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-176" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TFM16M"&gt;You can then freely move installed games over to the M.2 SSD storage, or install new games from the PlayStation Store directly to the storage. During testing, it took around 30 seconds to move &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; from the internal storage to the Corsair Force MP600 Pro (2TB) drive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CUsdKa"&gt;Sony’s new PS5 M.2 SSD support is in beta, so we’re still waiting to hear from SSD manufacturers about all the drives supported. Seagate is the first to confirm FireCuda 530 drives are compatible with the PS5, and we’ve tested Corsair’s Force MP600 to confirm it also works fine on the PS5 (albeit without the heatsink attached). We’ll have more details on supported drives as and when manufacturers confirm their list of SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola founder charged with securities fraud over allegedly fake truck demo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3dLD6koAhhBYEdpXstiChiKKLE=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69649948/nikola_world2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2jkAnO"&gt;In Southern District of New York federal court on Thursday, Nikola founder Trevor Milton was &lt;a href="https://t.co/JkbIeBYqqM"&gt;charged with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt;. The charges allege that Milton made a series of materially false claims which portrayed the electric vehicle company Nikola as far closer to releasing a functional product than it actually was, and raising more than $500 million of investment in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3PDD0"&gt;“Milton sold a version of Nikola not as it was – an early stage company with a novel idea to commercialize yet-to-be proven products and technology – but rather as a trail-blazing company that had already achieved many groundbreaking and game-changing milestones,” the indictment alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IkGnwT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Behold, the Nikola One in motion”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oEeeP1"&gt;Specifically, the indictment argues Milton used a staged video to create the false impression its Nikola One semi truck prototype was capable of moving under its own power, when in fact the vehicle was simply rolling downhill. Additionally, Milton falsely claimed the company was producing its own hydrogen fuels at below-market rates and had obtained “billions and billions and billions and billions” of dollars worth of committed truck orders, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB9u1I"&gt;A nominal rival to Tesla, Nikola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;rose to prominence in 2020&lt;/a&gt; with plans for a pickup truck and tractor trailer cab powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Excitement around the trucks peaked that September, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;General Motors announced a $2 billion deal&lt;/a&gt; to acquire an equity stake in the company and assist in the release of its Badger pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsqY2y"&gt;The excitement was short-lived: less than a week after the plans were announced, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck"&gt;a report from short-seller firm Hindenburg Research&lt;/a&gt; accused the company of fraud. Based on conversations with an anonymous former employee, the report alleged that a much-publicized demonstration had been stage-managed to give the impression that Nikola’s truck was capable of moving under its own power. Instead, the report claimed, “Nikola had the truck towed to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and simply filmed it rolling down the hill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUXmYH"&gt;The indictment echoes this claim. “A few weeks before the event, Nikola’s chief engineer informed Milton that the truck would not be functioning at the unveiling event unless the event was postponed,” prosecutors allege. “Milton made the decision to proceed as scheduled with the knowledge that the vehicle to be unveiled would not be functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vl5eU3"&gt;The indictment confirms that the truck’s movement was the result of rolling from the top of a hill, and claims the “towing-and-rolling process” was repeated three times to generate footage for the company’s commercial. Some footage was also sped up in editing, which “had the effect of making the Nikola One appear to move faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuAd4A"&gt;The final version of the video was posted to Nikola’s official YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter accounts with the caption, “Behold, the Nikola One in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScynTx"&gt;The indictment also gives more detail on precisely how nonfunctional the vehicle was. Prosecutors say all electrical components in the truck were powered externally (rather than from the truck’s battery), neither the fuel cell nor hydrogen gas storage tanks had been installed, the air compressor and turbine had not been commissioned, the gearboxes had not been assembled, and the vehicle-level controls were not complete. The dashboard interface that Milton appeared to use to start the truck was an off-the-shelf tablet and was not integrated into the vehicle’s systems in any way, the filing also alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0L4lWO"&gt;Hindenberg claimed in the report that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Nikola, although the SEC declined to confirm the investigation at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv0cnH"&gt;Fallout from the report was swift and devastating. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;General Motors backed out of the equity deal&lt;/a&gt;, and Milton stepped down as executive chairman shortly afterward. The company has continued operation but scaled down its ambitions significantly. In February, Nikola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301823/nikola-powersports-shuttered-nzt-wav"&gt;halted work on its planned electric ATV and motorboat&lt;/a&gt;, a decision that cost the company $14 million according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;
