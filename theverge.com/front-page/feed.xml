    <title>Foxconn and TSMC strike deal to buy 10 million COVID vaccines for Taiwan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TAIWAN-ECONOMY-SEMICONDUCTORS-TECHNOLOGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P10GTPH7I8QtQ0VPdCaOM3ZmnbI=/5x0:4775x3180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69569542/1231936348.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5Z5i0"&gt;Foxconn and TSMC, two Taiwanese giants of the international tech supply chain, have agreed to buy 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses for the island in a move that dodges a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22539799/taiwan-vaccine-negotiations-tsmc-foxconn-china-interference"&gt;standoff between Taipei and Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies will be paying up to $35 a dose of the BioNTech vaccine and donating them to the government; each company has pledged to spend $175 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaLXVT"&gt;BioNTech is partnered with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co. to distribute its mRNA-based vaccine, which was co-developed with Pfizer, within China. Taiwan claims that the Chinese government blocked an attempt to secure a supply of vaccines from BioNTech, and later refused an offer of vaccine donations from the mainland. With the new arrangement, however, BioNTech and Fosun are being allowed to deal with private companies rather than the Taiwanese government, which Beijing views as illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVmBhB"&gt;“Since we proposed the vaccine donation and started negotiating for the purchase, there had been no guidance or interference from Beijing over the acquisition,” Foxconn founder Terry Gou wrote &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TerryGou1018/posts/1201726933633910"&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, in remarks translated &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/Foxconn-and-TSMC-sign-350m-deal-to-buy-COVID-vaccines-for-Taiwan"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We appreciate that the negotiation was allowed to go through as a business matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6wqgqD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New COVID-19 outbreaks in Asia could exacerbate the global chip shortage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530908/covid-19-outbreaks-asia-global-chip-semiconductor-shortage"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZH1Up3"&gt;Foxconn is a huge contract electronics manufacturer with major clients including HP, Dell, and Lenovo, and it’s best known for being the largest iPhone assembler. TSMC is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing chips to spec for the likes of AMD, Apple and Nvidia; it’s responsible for the majority of smartphone SoCs worldwide. Most of Foxconn’s manufacturing happens in China and other countries, but TSMC’s main operating base is in the Hsinchu region of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKxLqR"&gt;Taiwan has been widely praised for its response to the pandemic, but is currently experiencing an outbreak that has killed more than 700 people and hastened the demand for vaccines. Last week the government said that a little over 14 percent of the population, or about 3.3 million people, had received one vaccine shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVnBS3"&gt;TSMC and Foxconn say the newly secured BioNTech doses will be shipped from its factories in Germany and should start to arrive in Taiwan from late September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked device lineup may have been entirely spoiled in huge new leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_XAJ-m4N_IHv_0MM-zJOyt6i5o=/0x35:608x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69568466/Screen_Shot_2021_07_11_at_3.56.50_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3, from GIFs shared by leaker Evan Blass.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fmaqzO"&gt;We might now know a lot of what’s coming at Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked event thanks to a series of tweets from noted leaker Evan Blass. It seems like the event could be a big one, as Blass tweeted a long thread with GIFs of two new Galaxy foldables, a new Galaxy FE phone, two new Galaxy Watches, and even a set of new Galaxy Buds. He also says the event is set to take place &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423"&gt;one month from now on August 11th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqej9"&gt;First up, the foldables. Blass has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;already leaked&lt;/a&gt; what appear to be official renders of the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which could support the S Pen stylus) and Galaxy Z Flip 3, but the new GIFs he shared give looks at both devices at all angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLbvNC"&gt;Here’s the Z Fold 3, which Blass shared GIFs of in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734357328699396"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734378996371456"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6izswb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zbFJvcSfv9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zbFJvcSfv9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBafbK"&gt;And here’s the Z Flip 3, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734389691953152"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734410827046913"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734420817891330"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lfD1KQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/cLlE0ot4fO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLlE0ot4fO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jp100o"&gt;Blass’ thread also includes GIFs of what look to be the rumored Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734430577938432"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570"&gt;a yellow-ish gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734449896992771"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734459933958145"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;. The phone, if released, will likely be a mid-range version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;the S21&lt;/a&gt; and looks to take a lot of design inspiration from the Samsung flagship (like how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; looked similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21172039/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review-camera-5g-screen-android"&gt;the S20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzXdQR"&gt;Whether or not this phone is actually in production has been something of an open question; in June, in response to a report claiming Samsung had stopped production of the phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung said that&lt;/a&gt; “nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.” These GIFs from Blass might be a sign that the phone is a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yPJmT8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/ovz5bzR8me"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ovz5bzR8me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzQagF"&gt;But Blass didn’t just share GIFs of phones — he also tweeted GIFs of two new Samsung watches. One model seems to match closely with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;rumors of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;, with what appears to be a rotating bezel and two buttons on the right side. The watch, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734469920509952"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734490271322114"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, is also expected to run &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;Google and Samsung’s new smartwatch platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TdDWiU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/A090015v7k"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A090015v7k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSPP4H"&gt;The other watch shared by Blass appears to match &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;rumors of the Galaxy Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;. This watch doesn’t look to have a rotating bezel, and according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1407653639011905539"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-5k-renders-details/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GizNext&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it might come in two different sizes: 44mm and 40mm. Blass shared GIFs of the watch in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734503168741380"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257"&gt;dark green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734530045915137"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734543111163906"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;, and two tweets of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734555039805443"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734567089950721"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; (though I can’t tell the difference between them besides what’s shown on the screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z2PZ7z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Ej15bzU6nE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ej15bzU6nE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kBPt5"&gt;Blass’ GIF thread also reveals three colors of unannounced Galaxy Buds that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;match rumors about the Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, which, according to leaker Ice Universe, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1412399234419023875"&gt;will have active noice cancelation&lt;/a&gt;. Blass’ GIFs show the buds and the inside of the white case in gray, purple, and white, matching the style of a leaked render &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that showed green, black, and white bud / inner case combos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JpGAqU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zt54JopQzc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zt54JopQzc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734590846492674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpeuP"&gt;Finally, let’s talk quickly about that rumored date, August 11th, which to me seems like the one you might want to circle on your calendar. When Samsung showed off its smartwatch platform developed with Google at the end of June, it said there would be an Unpacked event “&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/mwc-2021-samsung-presents-new-watch-experience-with-a-sneak-peek-of-one-ui-watch"&gt;later this summer&lt;/a&gt;,” so August 11th would fall in that timeline. And the company has hosted summer Unpacked events in early August for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17665284/samsung-galaxy-note-9-watch-bixby-home-speaker-news-unpacked-event-2018"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754898/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-5g-book-s-pen-unpacked-event-2019-biggest-announcements-news-recap"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21350066/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-note-20-event-biggest-announcements-products-recap"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;, meaning August 11th wouldn’t be out of the usual pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuHLqO"&gt;Since Samsung hasn’t officially announced any of these products or the date of the event, there’s always the chance that what Blass leaked doesn’t actually come out. But given Blass’ past track record and the detail of the GIFs he shared, it seems possible he may well have revealed some of the biggest news from Samsung’s next Unpacked event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Widow has been a big hit on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKlpuWW2xfFert6I-lkxqOy5dCA=/0x8:1231x829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69568084/fbg7020_comp_v003.1049_r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQzNME"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is the first Marvel movie to debut on Disney Plus the same day it hit theaters, and based on financial figures Disney released on Sunday, the movie has been very successful on the streaming service in its first weekend, where it is available as a Premier Access title. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/black-widow-opening-weekend-box-office-1234789473/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the movie has earned $60 million in sales on Disney Plus, which isn’t far behind the $80 million it earned in domestic box office sales and the $78 million it earned internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znuZCK"&gt;Disney first introduced the Premier Access program, which lets Disney Plus subscribers stream select new movies for $30 the day they debut in theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;with 2020’s &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were also available on Premier Access when they were released this year. But these &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; figures are the first Disney has shared about how a film has performed on Premier Access, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports, and they indicate that streaming at home is still a popular way to see the film even though taking a trip to the movies is an option for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YoJL3q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s only one more Premier Access movie on the way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh12Rv"&gt;However, it’s not clear if Disney will be offering many movies through Premier Access going forward. The only remaining Premier Access film in the pipeline (that we know of) is &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt;, which will be released &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jungle-cruise-to-debut-in-theaters-and-on-disney-premier-access/"&gt;in theaters and on Disney Plus on July 30th&lt;/a&gt;. And Disney has already announced that &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;(which is the next Marvel flick)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are debuting exclusively in theaters on August 13th and September 3rd, respectively (though they’ll have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;a shortened 45-day theatrical exclusivity window&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FikuqR"&gt;Disney also isn’t the only one turning its focus back to theater-first debuts: Warner Bros. will return to releasing films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;exclusively on the big screen in 2022&lt;/a&gt; after premiering all of its 2021 movies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps the strong performance of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; on Premier Access will make Disney consider releasing future titles on Disney Plus when they hit theaters. (If anyone from Disney is reading this, I’d love to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the comfort of my living room when it comes out.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sealed Super Mario 64 sells for more than $1.5 million, almost doubling a record just set on Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zaBt6YgXSp1VGAqTK4nXk4eZH4I=/0x40:1792x1235/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69567895/Screen_Shot_2021_07_11_at_11.13.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Req545"&gt;On Friday, when I wrote about how a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for the NES &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;sold for an eye-popping $870,000 at auction&lt;/a&gt; and set a new record for the most expensive video game ever sold, I wondered which game would be the first to sell for more than a million. Just two days later, I have my answer: a sealed copy of the Nintendo 64 classic &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/super-mario-64-wata-98-a-sealed-n64-nintendo-1996-usa/a/7261-28137.s"&gt;sold for an astonishing $1,560,000&lt;/a&gt; at Heritage Auctions on Sunday, smashing the record that had just been claimed by &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCdACD"&gt;Over the past 12 months, the record for the most expensive video game ever has risen dramatically. Here’s the timeline of the record, as far as I am aware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wtexn0"&gt;July 10th, 2020: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. &lt;/em&gt;sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;$114,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYSbMX"&gt;November 23rd, 2020: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3 &lt;/em&gt;sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591120/super-mario-bros-3-record-breaking-auction-price-condition-sealed"&gt;$156,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9yZY8i"&gt;April 2nd, 2021: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364245/super-mario-bros-most-expensive-game-ever-record-sealed-auction"&gt;$660,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yZ5Bc9"&gt;July 9th, 2021: copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;$870,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZCnXId"&gt;July 11th, 2021: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; sells for &lt;a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/super-mario-64-wata-98-a-sealed-n64-nintendo-1996-usa/a/7261-28137.s"&gt;$1,560,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zyzMSO"&gt;It’s not just video games that have skyrocketed. The value of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/pokemon-cards-worth-a-fortune-to-collectors-and-startups-alike"&gt;Pokémon cards has been on a tear, too&lt;/a&gt;, and eBay even announced a feature for its app to make it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370253/ebay-app-scan-pokemon-cards-sell-more-easily-listing"&gt;easier to scan trading cards&lt;/a&gt; to sell on the auction site. The prices of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, a form of digital collectibles, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/nft-price-crash-what-next-for-digital-collectibles.html"&gt;seems to be dropping, though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic successfully sends Richard Branson to the edge of space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7RRCxceUN-0bVX4WUjoaAIFAVqs=/14x0:4486x2981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69567345/1233923045.16.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JUbA24"&gt;Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson and a crew of Virgin Galactic employees nailed a clean touchdown in New Mexico on Sunday after launching to space aboard the company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane. The mission, dubbed Unity 22, marked the fourth test flight to space for the vehicle and the first for Branson, the 70-year-old daredevil entrepreneur who’s been waiting over a decade for his debut trek to the edge of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0wmrV"&gt;The SpaceShipTwo plane, dubbed VSS Unity, took off at 10:40AM ET attached to the belly of Virgin Galactic’s twin-fuselage WhiteKnight plane. Unity dropped from the center of the carrier craft at an altitude of around 45,000 feet roughly 50 minutes after takeoff. Moments later VSS Unity ignited its single rocket engine to blast to the edge of space, reaching 53.5 miles above the ground. The crew basked in a few moments of weightlessness before gliding back to land in New Mexico at Spaceport America, the central hub for Virgin Galactic’s nascent space tourism business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G1EsfLv6TqhUCsFzdc0bx_LQQ3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22711015/Screen_Shot_2021_07_11_at_11.25.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The SpaceShipTwo rocket ignites&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="goTi7O"&gt;Branson shared congratulatory hand shakes with his fellow crew members as VSS Unity entered microgravity, later calling the flight “an experience of a lifetime,” as heard on plane’s choppy communications line to ground control. Once landed, Branson hopped out of VSS Unity and skipped toward a crowd of photographers, children, and relatives just outside Spaceport America. He could barely contain his excitement in a post-flight ceremony: “I was upside down a few minutes ago” he started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xlzrPO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the ship looked perfect”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tOdpq5"&gt;“I think like most kids I have dreamt of this moment as a kid, but honestly nothing could prepare you for the view of Earth from space,” Branson said. Then, in full salesman mode, he called Virgin Galactic “the spaceline for Earth” and delivered on a promise to announce something “very exciting” after his flight: He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572643/virgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space"&gt;revealed a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with fundraising company Omaze to give out two seats on VSS Unity, and — “with my Willy Wonka hat on,” he quipped — a personal tour of Spaceport America. “And I promise lots of chocolate in the factory,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq52sh"&gt;Virgin Galactic president Mike Moses told reporters “the ship looked perfect” at touchdown, besides a possible antenna issue that caused a live video feed from inside the cabin to glitch during key moments of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvIY52"&gt;Branson was “feeling good, feeling excited, feeling ready” ahead of his flight to space, riding a bike to the spaceport before sunrise, flanked by two white Range Rovers. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485?s=20"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he started the morning off with a visit from Elon Musk, who was in New Mexico to watch the mission in person. Onboard SpaceShipTwo with Branson were two pilots, Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, and three other crew members in the cabin: Chief Astronaut Instructor Beth Moses, Lead Operations Engineer Colin Bennett, and Vice President of Government Affairs and Research Operations Sirisha Bandla. The crew tested out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21340015/virgin-galactic-cabin-interior-unveil-passenger-seats-space-tourism"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s cabin experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vs_hR_h95K6MjEEBenFxsFf5aqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22711187/1233924161.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XpB3xk"&gt;Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield awarded Branson and the crew gold-colored pins to inaugurate their new status to Virgin Galactic as commercial astronauts, having flown above the 50-mile-line deemed to be space by the Federal Aviation Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnQIFO"&gt;Branson’s flight was a golden opportunity to attract potential customers for Virgin Galactic’s space tourism business, so the atmosphere at Spaceport America on Sunday was full of marketing and theatrics. For attendees, the spaceport looked like a music festival, sitting next to the runway VMS Eve took off from. Dozens of guests watched the mission on a giant screen at the center of a stage set up just outside the main building of Spaceport America. Stephen Colbert hosted the mission’s livestream and singer-songwriter Khalid performed a new single on the stage. A fleet of Range Rovers towed VSS Unity back to Spaceport America after landing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="koEqC9"&gt;Space tourism ready for takeoff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="683KFh"&gt;Virgin Galactic previously planned to fly Branson as a passenger on a later test flight, but earlier this month the company announced he’d be bumped up to fly on Unity 22 as a crew member instead. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;set Branson up to make it to space ahead of his rival Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt;, another billionaire who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;plans to fly&lt;/a&gt; his space company’s New Shepard rocket to the edge of space on July 20th. It’s a PR-heavy display of competition, but for Branson, who turns 71 on July 18th, it’s executing a decades-long dream to go to space. And for Virgin Galactic, flying its billionaire founder is seen as a show of confidence that SpaceShipTwo is safe for anyone to fly. In 2014, the company suffered a mid-flight disaster during a test flight that killed one pilot and severely injured another. After that flight, Branson &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-crisis-management-2014-11"&gt;vowed to travel&lt;/a&gt; on a future flight before the company started flying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdyltS"&gt;The Unity 22 mission marks a key step forward for the company’s development of SpaceShipTwo as it tries to lead a burgeoning space tourism market catered to wealthy adventure-seekers. Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004 and has already sold roughly 600 tickets priced around $250,000 a pop, but it hasn’t flown any of those passengers yet. The company has two more test missions planned this year before kicking off its commercial space tourism business in 2022. But like any launch, that plan hinges on the outcome of Sunday’s test flight. Vehicle inspections and weeks of post-mission data reviews will inform how it plans to move forward, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1gAJjd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Branson’s Virgin Galactic is competing with Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aP1OCY"&gt;Also vying for a slice of the space tourism market is Bezos’ Blue Origin — which hasn’t announced its ticket price point yet — and Musk’s SpaceX. Like Virgin’s SpaceShipTwo, Blue Origin’s crew vehicle is suborbital, though it’s a gumdrop-shaped capsule that launches vertically atop a 5-story-tall rocket and ascends to an altitude of 62 miles. Blue Origin’s July 20th flight with Bezos, the company’s first to fly humans, will include Bezos’ brother Mark, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558908/wally-funk-flight-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-new-shepard"&gt;aviation legend Wally Funk&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530907/blue-origin-auction-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-space-28-million"&gt;undisclosed winner of a $28 million auction&lt;/a&gt; for a fourth seat. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;SpaceX’s space tourism plans&lt;/a&gt; are even more involved; its Crew Dragon capsule will launch to orbit for a few days for a price of roughly $55 million per seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47qnrw"&gt;The competitive space industry vibes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570287/space-tourism-virgin-galactic-branson-blue-origin-bezos"&gt;flared&lt;/a&gt; in the weeks leading up to Unity 22. Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001?s=20"&gt;threw shade&lt;/a&gt; at Virgin Galactic in a snarky tweet two days before Branson's flight, alleging Branson isn’t really reaching space because SpaceShipTwo flies a few miles below the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18130973/space-karman-line-definition-boundary-atmosphere-astronauts"&gt;boundary of space&lt;/a&gt; recognized by an international sports organization. Jeff Bezos had more positive vibes on Saturday, wishing Branson good luck in an Instagram post. Musk has been cordial throughout, keeping a distance from the PR war and meeting up with Branson in New Mexico. “Thanks for being so typically supportive and such a good friend, Elon,” Branson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1413886033330982915?s=20"&gt;tweeted to Musk&lt;/a&gt; on the eve of his flight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic has opened a sweepstakes offering a trip to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9pE8thy2Q26HS5vrk1dAdKm3C9c=/63x0:749x457/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69567775/162561738443018386_812x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceplane, the VSS Unity.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Omaze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8pSMpm"&gt;Virgin Galactic just successfully sent founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;Richard Branson to the edge of space and back&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company is offering a chance for you to take the trip in the company’s spaceplane as well. After Sunday’s flight, Branson announced that Virgin Galactic had partnered with fundraising platform Omaze to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omaze.com%2Fproducts%2Fvirgin-galactic-2021%3Fref%3Dspace&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F11%2F22572643%2Fvirgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;open a sweepstakes&lt;/a&gt; that will send the winner and a friend on a spaceflight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1UyN"&gt;The winner will take a trip on the VSS Unity spaceplane, the same plane Branson traveled on. You’ll also get a tour of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Spaceport America&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico from Branson himself, “with my Willa Wonka hat on,” Branson said. (“And I promise lots of chocolate in the factory,” he joked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HjkC5J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-F4Q9cvpf8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOEru6"&gt;The sweepstakes is also a fundraiser for the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://spaceforhumanity.org/?locale=en"&gt;Space for Humanity&lt;/a&gt;, and the more you donate, the more entries you get (though the fine print says that the maximum amount of entries for one person is 6,000). You can also submit an entry without donating if you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjm0o9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omaze.com%2Fproducts%2Fvirgin-galactic-2021%3Fref%3Dspace&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F11%2F22572643%2Fvirgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The sweepstakes&lt;/a&gt; closes on September 1st at 2:59AM ET, and the winner will be announced “around” September 29th, according to the website. Among other restrictions, you must be 18 years or older to enter, and the winner and their guest will have to prove that they’re vaccinated against COVID-19 to be eligible to win the sweepstakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QU8bZ"&gt;The “experience” is estimated to take place in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nxqVqF"&gt;Clubhouse has another partnership, and this time, it’s with one of the most popular podcast networks. The company announced today that it’s partnering with TED to bring exclusive chats to the social audio platform throughout the summer and beyond. The first room, called &lt;em&gt;Thank Your Ass Off&lt;/em&gt;, will start July 12th and run weekly at 11AM ET on Mondays. The company says additional rooms will launch soon, all going through TED’s Clubhouse club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMwdVZ"&gt;Under the deal, TED is free to sell brand partnerships or ads, if it’s interested, and Clubhouse won’t take a cut, a spokesperson confirms. The partnership makes sense given that people often compare Clubhouse rooms to TED talks, essentially meaning people wax on about big ideas and often do so in the style of a conference presentation. The company is also already a major success in audio through its podcasting efforts, so it’s possible a form of these chats might be distributed outside the app as an RSS feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qS5q7T"&gt;TED &lt;a href="https://blog.ted.com/ted-launches-ted-audio-collective-for-podcasts/"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its Audio Collective in February this year, and at the time, said its shows were downloaded 1.65 million times per day in “virtually every country on Earth.” Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/the-trends-that-shaped-streaming-in-2020/"&gt;also says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;TED Talks Daily&lt;/em&gt; was the second most popular show globally on its platform in 2020. All of which is to say, TED knows how to do audio, people like listening to its programming, and Clubhouse can benefit from that buzz. On TED’s end, it can host regular Q&amp;amp;As and integrate audience interaction, which it can’t do through the usual podcast recording means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JJ48jc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The partnership doesn’t have an end date, Clubhouse says&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qjYYRF"&gt;Increasingly, it seems like the winners in social audio might come down to whoever can lock down talent. Presumably, Spotify will encourage its podcasters to use Greenroom, its Clubhouse competitor, while Facebook has planned to work with Bobby Berk, Tina Knowles-Lawson, and Joe Budden, among others, for its Live Audio Rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJtAS3"&gt;Twitter and the NFL &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568434/nfl-twitter-spaces-partnership-2021-season"&gt;announced this past week&lt;/a&gt; that the league would create “exclusive content” for Twitter Spaces, its live audio platform. Clubhouse previously &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/clubhouse-announces-exclusive-content-deal-with-nfl-its-first-official-spo/599005/"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; exclusive NFL chats during Draft Week, and a spokesperson confirms that despite this Twitter deal, Clubhouse is still working with the NFL on future programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H24jk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 11th, 12:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect confirmation from Clubhouse’s spokesperson about its NFL deal and future plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZSA’s Moonlander Mark I is the ultimate customizable ergonomic keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;But you’ll probably have to put in time to make it fit you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5BDpAn"&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Business-5KV-00001/dp/B00CYX26BC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage2-keyboard/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/"&gt;ergonomic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle-pro/"&gt;keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/"&gt;ZSA’s Moonlander Mark I&lt;/a&gt; may be my favorite one I’ve ever used. It’s a customizable mechanical keyboard that’s split into two halves for better shoulder ergonomics. You can adjust its tilt to make it most comfortable to your hands. You can swap out the switches for any key without much effort. You can program multiple functions for every single key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LKNlz"&gt;I’ve been typing full-time on the Moonlander for about three months, and I may very well switch over permanently from my previous daily driver, &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle-pro/"&gt;the Kinesis Freestyle Pro&lt;/a&gt;. But getting the Moonlander to that point has taken a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoMIH1"&gt;The keyboard is endlessly customizable, and the sheer amount of options at your disposal can be overwhelming. Even if you’re used to typing on an ergonomic split keyboard, like I am, it could still take weeks until you’ve dialed in all of its adjustments. And then there’s the Moonlander’s price: an eye-watering $365 to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yseoaj"&gt;If you want one of the best ergonomic keyboards available, and you’re willing to pay for the amount of customization it offers, I’d say the Moonlander is worth that steep price. But for someone who is thinking about making the Moonlander their first ergonomic keyboard, you might want to consider a more affordable option to see if you even like using this kind of keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZIph2g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10642613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8sg9Oq"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way first: yes, the Moonlander, with its split layout, tented angles, and the clusters of keys designed to be used by your thumbs, just doesn’t look much like a traditional keyboard. If you’re coming from a more standard keyboard layout to the Moonlander, it’s probably going to feel strange to type on at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG9JHG"&gt;You’re almost certainly going to go through a potentially weeks-long adjustment period until you’re typing at full speed. I’ve used two keyboards with layouts similar to the Moonlander as my daily drivers before — &lt;a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/"&gt;ZSA’s ErgoDox EZ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/"&gt;Kinesis’ Advantage 2&lt;/a&gt; — and it still took me a couple weeks to feel fully comfortable on the Moonlander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnYKz8"&gt;But now that I’m used to it, I am a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fan of everything nontraditional about the Moonlander’s design. The split layout lets me type with my shoulders in a more open position. Typing at an angle feels better for my hands, and you can easily change that angle by adjusting the keyboard’s feet. That fine level of control isn’t something I’ve had with most other ergonomic keyboards I’ve used — with the Kinesis Freestyle Pro, for example, you need to attach a separate accessory to tent the keyboard and it only offers three different angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XMIS5eqqXTSurEmXpngjYzu-UHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706307/jpeters_210707_4662_0009.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One of the Moonlander’s legs, which are easily adjustable. You can &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/accessories/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;swap them out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; if you want.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nrZeU7"&gt;Ergonomically, the Moonlander feels great. I can type on it for a full eight-plus hour workday and my hands usually won’t get sore. (By comparison, if I spend more than a couple hours on my MacBook Air’s flat keyboard, I have to stretch my hands or take short breaks because my wrists start to flare up.) My one wish is that I could angle up the inside edges of the Moonlander even higher so it would better match the height I’m used to on my Kinesis Freestyle Pro. But I should say that even though the keyboard feels good ergonomically for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, everybody’s hands and needs are different, so I can’t guarantee that it will be a perfect fit for you, even with how adjustable it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sByIyd"&gt;The keyboard comes with integrated wrist rests, but you can fold them out of the way, where they cleverly attach magnetically to the underside of the keyboard. (Folding up the wrist rests also makes the keyboard fit nicely in the included carrying case.) And if you want, you can take the wrist rests off entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moonlander at my preferred angle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="972jOD"&gt;I love the thumb clusters, which I’ve programmed for common keys like space, backspace, and enter. (More on that programmability later.) The angle of the thumb cluster can also be adjusted, though you’ll have to loosen it with an included hex key. I thought I’d use the big red keys at the top of the thumb cluster, but for me, they’re just out of reach to be comfortable to use in regular typing. I eventually turned the left one into a layer switcher for my media keys. The right one has a slightly more fun purpose that I’ll explain later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rwgt5U7lvj1BDQbD-Jsbqt4qEQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706304/jpeters_210706_4662_0006.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the right thumb cluster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rNAnt"&gt;Swapping out key switches is a breeze, thanks in large part to the included tool that lets you pull up keys and their underlying key switches without the need to desolder anything. (Keyboard enthusiasts will know this is referred to as “hot swappable” switches.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lS2LK"&gt;That tool also makes it easy to pull everything off so you can clean the keyboard and every key, which I can do over the course of about two hours. If you go with the white model, you’ll be glad cleaning the keyboard is so simple, since the included keycaps can get grimy within a matter of days. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included key puller makes it easy to swap keys and switches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YGw_fgvw7hJ_xcwfbUOJSTLRk0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706300/jpeters_210609_4662_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s under the key switches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XFmeYH"&gt;When you order a Moonlander from ZSA, you can pick from 10 different key switches: two types of Cherry-manufactured switches (brown and blue) and eight types of Kailh-manufactured switches (bronze, gold, silver, copper, box brown, box red, box white, and box black). You can also &lt;a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/accessories/"&gt;order switches from ZSA separately&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d like. The board supports both 3-pin or 5-pin switches, so if you want to swap in another option, you can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHfEsv"&gt;I ordered my review unit with Cherry MX brown key switches since I was familiar with them from my Kinesis, and they sound nice and clicky, with a tactile tick for each press. ZSA also sent me samples of Kailh silver and bronze switches to try. The silvers were a linear switch that felt too mushy for me. I loved the clicky bronzes (which are also known as thick golds), I just wished they were a little quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGfygL"&gt;If you want to outfit the keyboard in your own keycaps, you can use 1u keycaps for the 64 main keys on the board. (You can also buy keys with just the line on &lt;a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/accessories/"&gt;ZSA’s website in batches of 10&lt;/a&gt;.) Using your own keycaps with the thumb cluster requires less common sizing — the six rectangular keys use 1.5u keycaps and the two big red buttons use 2u keycaps — which might make it harder to find custom caps if you want to customize the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zIXQZq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Moonlander has a columnar layout&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7IRexe"&gt;The keys on the Moonlander are in line with each other instead of being slightly offset. The idea with this staggered columnar layout is that it’s easier for your fingers to reach keys above and below the home row, but I didn’t feel a major difference in reachability between the Moonlander’s layout and the offset layout of my MacBook Air’s keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvH7Jz"&gt;You might have also seen that the keys are laid out in a nontraditional way out of the box, and that many keys you might expect to see just aren’t there. Notice how there’s no marked Windows key? No Command key? Or how about things like shift, return, or even a spacebar? None of those are officially labeled on the Moonlander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cone2Fyj0Lf1HkxZq2OyhIci6H4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706303/jpeters_210706_4662_0005.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The left side of the keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ERJumu"&gt;This is where the Moonlander’s software steps in — you can pick where all those keys go yourself. Using ZSA’s online configurator tool, you can program an impressive number of options for each key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXOxsw"&gt;If you just want a key to do a single function, you can set that. But you can also set macros, and not just one per key: if you want, you can set up to &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; different macros per key, depending on combinations of tapping and holding the key. You can also set different &lt;em&gt;layers&lt;/em&gt; of entirely different layouts, which you can swap to by, yes, customizing keys on your keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IV2Bz"&gt;All this doesn’t mean that out of the box, you won’t be able to hit the spacebar. You just have to know where to look for it. Check out &lt;a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/default/latest/0"&gt;the default layout&lt;/a&gt;, from ZSA’s online configurator tool. It places the space bar in the left thumb cluster on the left-most key. Backspace is one key over from that one. Return? On the right-hand thumb cluster on the right-most key.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eh-Ef-5XpGfAOiSKdxkg81zTGyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702856/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_9.03.31_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main layer of the default Moonlander layout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r4JaFS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/5yRQn/pxMOE/0"&gt;My layout is much different&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a &lt;a href="https://colemak.com/"&gt;Colemak typist&lt;/a&gt;, so I had to remap many letter keys just so that I could type words. But over time, I kept tweaking my layout to add a few more advanced shortcuts thanks to macros. For example, I can press and hold X, C, and V to perform cut, copy, and paste, respectively. (This doesn’t work perfectly — I’m sure my colleagues have wondered why I sometimes just type the letter “v” in Slack.) I made a separate layer that’s designed almost exclusively to make it easier to watch YouTube videos, with arrow keys under the WASD keys, one-key shortcuts to speed up and slow down videos, and easy access to the volume controls. My editor suggested I set macros to mute and end Zoom meetings, which I added promptly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZruP66osxhL7Gx60-TDtRaIJCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702855/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_9.02.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main layer of my layout. The red keys indicate keys that have multiple functions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UKEWZj"&gt;At this point I would find it hard to live without my current layout on the Moonlander, especially for my day-to-day work. And I’ve noticed that I’m just not as efficient when I’m typing on the “normal” keyboard on my MacBook Air, especially when I can’t do my handy press-and-hold shortcuts. The MacBook Air has an advantage with its function row, which lets me raise or lower volume with just one keystroke — on my Moonlander setup, it takes two because I have to switch to my dedicated layer — but it’s only a minor disadvantage that I’ve gotten used to. And if I really wanted to, I could find a way to put media controls on my main layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXqx1v"&gt;Getting my Moonlander to work exactly the way I wanted took about two weeks of near-daily tweaks, though. Sometimes, my imagined improvements were hilariously off-base. The first time I flashed a custom layout onto the keyboard, I immediately realized that I forgot to add an apostrophe key, which is kind of an important one in my work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvRWhe"&gt;Depending on how much you want to customize your layout, you might spend a long time fiddling with ideas in the configurator tool. There were a couple times early on where I’d spend upward of half an hour after work putting together new ideas. Fortunately, once you’ve decided on a layout, actually implementing it is speedy, as it only takes a minute or two to download and flash it to the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6fPQc"&gt;And to be fair, you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to customize the Moonlander within an inch of its life like I have. It’s a perfectly functional keyboard right out of the box, and I’m sure you could get used to it in time. But to be honest, I didn’t use the default layout at all; since I already had an idea of some customizations I wanted to make based on my experience with the ErgoDox, and I flashed those onto the keyboard right away and used them as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ARLhLj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The flexibility can create a paralysis of choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zlhSTI"&gt;The freedom to decide which keys go where can also create a paralysis of choice. I was stumped for days trying to figure out the “best” way to replicate an inverted T arrow key layout, and eventually, I gave up, keeping two arrow keys on each side of the keyboard but in a slightly different position from the default. Trying to nail where the Mac’s Command key should go was a puzzle as well, and my solution to put it on the keys closest to the thumb clusters still feels imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bg54DJ"&gt;There are also programmable RGB LEDs under each key, meaning that in addition to trying to figure out what each key &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;, you might also delve into how each key &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt;, too. For my main layer, I’ve landed on keeping all the lights off most of the time, but I can flip on some prebuilt animations if I’m feeling colorful. You can switch between these prebuilt animations with the press of a key, too, which is what I use that big red key on the right side of the keyboard for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UwroRk1TSpWjLWOuGX5IVsi7tHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702883/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oamhSh"&gt;On my media controls layer, I have a more practical use for the RGB LEDs: lighting up just the keys I’ve programmed for different functions. (I admit that I’ve changed the colors assigned to those keys a few times, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olck4B"&gt;One other thing I should mention is that the left side of the Moonlander can function on its own, which opens up a lot of interesting possibilities for gamers. I’m not much of a PC gamer, but I could easily imagine a scenario where you create a gaming-focused macro layer on the left side of the keyboard and unplug the right side entirely to open up some desk space for your mouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2tkAw"&gt;While doing some research for this review, I came upon my colleague Alex Cranz’s great 2017 article &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/key-crazy-inside-the-wonderful-world-of-keyboard-fanat-1794380835"&gt;about the world of mechanical keyboard fans&lt;/a&gt;. It ends with a quote that I haven’t been able to get out of my head: “There’s no best keyboard... There’s the best keyboard for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcItd7"&gt;I honestly can’t tell you if ZSA’s Moonlander is the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; ergonomic keyboard out there. It works very well &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;, well enough that I might not go back to my trusty Kinesis Freestyle Pro. But it took weeks of tweaking, adjustments, and time on the keys to get it to a point where I felt that way. And if you drop the $365 to get a Moonlander for yourself, it might be a rough adjustment period to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YHamVU"&gt;Once you’ve wrapped your head around all of the possibilities offered by the Moonlander, though, your imagination might run wild. It offers a whole lot that can make it the best keyboard for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feds indict ‘The Bull’ for selling insider trading info on the dark web</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wPq6Lq"&gt;Nearly four years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15975140/alphabay-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road"&gt;the lights went out at AlphaBay&lt;/a&gt;, the feds are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18226718/alphabay-takedown-drug-marketplace-federal-arrest"&gt;still charging people with criminal activities linked to the dark web marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/sec-charges-thebull-selling-insider-trading-tips-dark-web"&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/dark-web-user-known-bull-charged-insider-trading-scheme"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; announced charges against Apostolos Trovias, a Greek national who they allege posted on dark web marketplaces using the nickname “The Bull.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="icUdHF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trovias is facing charges of securities fraud and money laundering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IapKZ2"&gt;However, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17509444/dark-web-drug-market-money-laundering-hsi-dark-gold"&gt;drug dealers targeted in previous actions&lt;/a&gt;, the authorities allege Trovias used dark web forums as a way to troll for people willing to buy or sell insider trading information while hiding behind “anonymizing software, screen names, and bitcoin payments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUIRTg"&gt;On AlphaBay and other dark web sites like Dream Market or Nightmare Market, the indictment alleges Trovias offered and eventually sold stock tips. However, as the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-122.pdf"&gt;complaint describes&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) his customers included at least one IRS agent and an FBI agent working undercover. In 2017, the document alleges Trovias gave the IRS agent pre-release info from earnings releases on at least two occasions in exchange for Bitcoin. The information came from quarterly earnings reports for Illumina and Analogic, although the documents indicate Trovias mixed up some of the data on one of the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xWx5M0"&gt;Between in or about December 2016, when he registered for the site, and in or about July 2017, when AlphaBay ceased operations, APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, a/k/a “The Bull,” the defendant, offered for sale, in, among other places, the “Fraud &amp;gt; Other&amp;gt; Other “ category on AlphaBay, stock tips that were based on nonpublic inside information about certain securities issuers and which could be purchased individually, on a weekly basis, or on a monthly basis for prices ranging from approximately $29.95 per tip to approximately $329.95 for a monthly subscription for tips based on non-public inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V4NQb"&gt;6. Between in or about December 2016, when APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, a/k/a “The Bull,” the defendant, registered his account, and in or about July 2017, when AlphaBay ceased operations, TROVIAS completed the sale of dozens of individual tips, approximately three weekly plans, and approximately three monthly plans, for a total of approximately 45 transactions through the AlphaBay marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qXxcf"&gt;7. Also in or about 2017, APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, a/k/a “ The Bull ,” the defendant, offered for sale and did sell, among other confidential information belonging to various securities issuers, for approximately $5,000 in Bitcoin, at least one pre-release earnings report misappropriated from a publicly-traded company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5fv4vj"&gt;As late as 2020, the feds claim Trovias was trying to build his own dark web site, likely because the marketplaces he used kept getting shut down. The SEC and DOJ documents don’t mention taking the man into custody. However,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://PCMag.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out a document from May 27th &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F515111188%2FTrovias&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F10%2F22571732%2Falphabay-dark-web-insider-trading-bitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pursuing extradition&lt;/a&gt; after he was arrested in Peru. The DOJ has charged him with one count of securities fraud which carries a max penalty of 25 years in jail, as well as one count of money laundering with a max penalty of 20 years in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bo Burnham’s Netflix special Inside will make a one-night-only theater appearance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bo Burnham in Bo Burnham: Inside.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3WyLQfnKSLN6vRbXjpCAzcx4ku8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69565724/Bo_Burnham__Inside_00_28_48_22.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncRzgV"&gt;If you can’t get “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7_EeCkHs-e0"&gt;Bezos I&lt;/a&gt;” out of your head, then you’re in good company as a soundtrack to &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81289483"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bo Burnham: Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; scored the comedian &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billboardcharts/status/1406973768568872961"&gt;the first Billboard Top 10 appearance of his career.&lt;/a&gt; But since the musical comedy special was on Netflix and came out during the pandemic that inspired much of its content, you probably watched it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZoYq3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0HWxswRuYQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEk5CP"&gt;Now fans of the special can see it in a group setting, as Netflix and Iconic Events have teamed up to present the special in theaters nationwide on July 22nd. Tickets are available at many theaters across the country, but you may want to move fast — at the moment there is only one showing per theater at the locations I checked, and some already show that they’re sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylaJjD"&gt;Check the &lt;a href="http://boBurnhamInside.com"&gt;BoBurnhamInside.com&lt;/a&gt; website for showing and ticket information, assuming you’re ready to see the show in the company of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
