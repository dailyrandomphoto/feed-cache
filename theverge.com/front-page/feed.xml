    <title>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 will reportedly include both AMD and Intel configurations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3qfrI2"&gt;For a while, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 3 was one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; you could buy. Microsoft is now planning its successor, the Surface Laptop 4, and it appears &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,121617.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has obtained details about this upcoming device. Per this report, the laptop is coming sometime in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUDqvj"&gt;The biggest news is that the new Surface Laptop will come with both Intel and AMD options. The AMD models will include chips from the Ryzen 4000 mobile series, including the Ryzen 5 4680U and the Ryzen 7 4980U. These aren’t AMD’s top guns; the current-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;Ryzen 5000 mobile series&lt;/a&gt; was announced earlier this year. The Intel models will have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Intel’s latest 11th Gen CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, though, including the Core 15-1145G7 and the Core i7-1185G7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5jzn8"&gt;Apart from the chips, it seems like very little is changing between the Laptop 3 and the Laptop 4. Here are some other tidbits we’ve learned from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s report: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="T8zV5B"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There will be 13.5- and 15-inch models available. &lt;/strong&gt;These are also the models that the Surface Laptop 3 offered. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WB1VRc"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All models have a 3:2 aspect ratio. &lt;/strong&gt;The resolution of the 13.5-inch device will be 2256 x 1504, and the 15-inch will be 2496 x 1664. These are the same resolutions that the Surface Laptop 3 offered. The 3:2 aspect ratio has been a staple of Microsoft’s Surface products for a few years now. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZnzTV9"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RAM maxes out at 32GB.&lt;/strong&gt; But it looks like if you want that much memory, you’ll need to get an Intel model. The AMD configurations only go up to 16GB. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RWPhut"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Storage maxes out at 1TB&lt;/strong&gt;. Similarly, it looks like only the Intel models offer that much storage. AMD laptops will max out at 512GB. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jhVnT7"&gt;If these leaks are true, I’m expecting Microsoft will take a similar approach to the Surface Laptop 4 as it did to the Surface Book 3 last spring — that is, bump up the chips with minimal changes to the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Microsoft Surface Laptop 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83hkaLkGBV2kvydYC0SbSU9JY10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19250347/akrales_190930_3689_0135.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the Surface Laptop 3, to give you an idea of what the Surface Laptop 4 will look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y1FgHG"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s nothing to be excited about, of course. Chip upgrades are still a big deal. One of our primary complaints about both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932406/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-13-5-inch-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;13.5-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923620/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-15-inch-review-windows-test-price-specs-features"&gt;15-inch Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt; models was that their battery life wasn’t great compared to the competition. The 15-inch model also ran into some performance issues in our testing. It had significant trouble running 4K 60fps videos and completing media exports. It will be great if the new chips are able to address some of these drawbacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIj0Gx"&gt;I wouldn’t blame Microsoft for not overhauling the design; people like it, and why fix what’s not broken? But as I noted in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;review of the Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only so long the Surface line’s look can stay relevant. Across the market, laptop bezels are shrinking, chassis are getting lighter, and customers are expecting a sleeker and more modern vibe from both high-end and midrange products. The Surface Laptop’s design was never ugly, but as the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre&lt;/a&gt; continue to evolve, I worry that it won’t be too long before the Surface line’s look is left behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl49XV"&gt;All that’s being said: these are still rumors at this stage, so treat them with a grain of salt. I’ll be sure to update you when we’ve gotten more concrete information about this upcoming device, hopefully sooner rather than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYVG7m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzOSqU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cH3hVj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX moves to beam Starlink internet into cars, boats, and aircraft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-URUGUAY-SPACE-SPACEX-SATELLITE-STARLINK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpks2oqkGe5lQ1t3rL67uo-B1II=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931738/1231167449.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A train of Starlink satellites in low-Earth orbit passes over Uruguay. SpaceX is asking the FCC for approval to beam Starlink internet into moving vehicles.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Mariana Suarez / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iBkAeU"&gt;SpaceX is seeking regulatory approval to connect its rapidly growing network of internet-beaming Starlink satellites to cars, trucks, shipping boats, and aircraft. The request, filed last Friday with the Federal Communications Commission, marks SpaceX’s biggest step yet toward connecting Starlink to the automotive sector, a potentially lucrative line of business that would expand the company’s current stationary offerings from rural homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fl4yaV"&gt;The March 5th FCC filing asked for “a blanket license authorizing operation” of Starlink terminals on so-called Earth Stations in Motion — an umbrella term for cars, trucks, maritime vessels, and aircraft. “No longer are users willing to forego connectivity while on the move, whether driving a truck across the country, moving a freighter from Europe to a U.S. port, or while on a domestic or international flight,” the filing read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sGgIw"&gt;With over 1,000 satellites in space, SpaceX’s Starlink has at least 10,000 users through an invite-only beta program it started last year. The beta program is currently aimed at rural parts of the US that have little to no internet connectivity. A Starlink kit with an antenna and router costs $499, plus $99 per month for speeds around 70 to 130 Mbps. Last month, SpaceX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;started accepting refundable $99 Starlink preorders&lt;/a&gt; for “a limited number of users per coverage area,” which so far includes parts of the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipw2iL"&gt;SpaceX’s request to link Starlink with vehicles didn’t give any details on any new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325413/spacex-starlink-user-terminals-antennas-internet-satellite-constellation-beta-testing"&gt;antenna designs&lt;/a&gt;, but it said they “are electrically identical to its previously authorized consumer user terminals but have mountings that allow them to be installed on vehicles, vessels and aircraft.” The mobile antennas would fit on the “masts of ships or the tops of semi- trucks” — or, in consumer cases, on “passenger cars or pleasure boats,” another SpaceX filing said. Unlike Starlink’s current terminals, which come with mounts and are installed by the customer, the vehicle antennas will be set up by “qualified installers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUDMxc"&gt;Throwing a Starlink terminal on a moving vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/musk-spacexs-starlink-internet-service-will-work-in-high-speed-moving-vehicles"&gt;isn’t a surprising move&lt;/a&gt; for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who said early last year “it’s certainly something that could happen in coming years,” when asked in &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4320044-tesla-inc-tsla-ceo-elon-musk-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;an earnings call&lt;/a&gt; if Teslas will ever be able to sport their own Starlink antennas. And in late 2020, SpaceX asked for an experimental FCC permit to operate Starlink terminals on Gulfstream jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI1PER"&gt;With the new filing, SpaceX now appears to be more focused on their mobile connectivity efforts, hinting that they plan to target their service at “drivers, ship operators, and air travelers in the United States and abroad.” Offering Starlink internet to those customers will “allow operators and passengers to access services that enable increased productivity,” SpaceX said. The filing also mentioned that it would “enhance the security of mobile platforms” but provided no further insights into those plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The brands are at it again — Taco Bell is hopping on the NFT train</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyt7vBEBALJqJiOB8Jwxqs7vjjM=/0x86:512x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931678/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is called Transformative Tacos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5cvPb"&gt;On Sunday evening, Taco Bell was serving up more than just tacos — it was also delivering NFTs: the fast-food chain &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tacobell/status/1368807880434982912"&gt;tweeted that it was selling taco-themed GIFs and images&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/tacobell?tab=created"&gt;NFT marketplace Rarible&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, everyone saw that it was a brand hopping on a bandwagon (one that could &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/"&gt;potentially be detrimental to the environment&lt;/a&gt;), and promptly ignored it. No one bought them, and no articles were written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56lqqu"&gt;Just kidding! Taco Bell said that the demand for the NFTs was hot, and that the 25 tokens apparently sold out in 30 minutes. The NFTs are, of course, taco-themed, with four out of the five designs being animated GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK12KARJmU1WOjk0cPmH-Vr7yZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354670/unnamed.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Taco Bell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taco cradle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="6SxHrd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FIsNqf"&gt;Taco Bell does say that all the proceeds will go to the Live Más Scholarship through the Taco Bell Foundation. Taco Bell also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the NFTs included a real-world perk in the form of a $500 electronic Taco Bell gift card. That perk, however, is reserved for the original owner of the NFT, a PR spokesperson confirmed. Not a bad deal for the people who paid a buck or two for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIKc1s"&gt;Taco Bell has hinted that it’s planning on doing another run of the tokens, but I wouldn’t rush to buy them in hopes of getting a gift card — there are no promises that future Taco Bell NFTs will include them. Also, you’d have to spend the rest of your life knowing that you gave your money to Taco Bell and got back a GIF, instead of a taco. Taco Bell says that NFTs are forever, but can they really be as satisfying as the crunch of a hard tortilla shell with some water-flavored lettuce? Or if you want a better tasting taco, the warm feeling you get from supporting a local taco place instead?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft was warned months ago — now, the Hafnium hack has grown to gigantic proportions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cJxHCLnJkXm5zZ__lHjOU6wJg8k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931642/acastro_170621_1777_0007_v2_0001_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UWSWR9"&gt;On Friday, cybersecurity journalists Brian Krebs and Andy Greenberg reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;as many as 30,000 organizations had been compromised&lt;/a&gt; in an unprecedented email server hack, believed to have originated from a state-sponsored Chinese hacking group known as Hafnium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCiEhB"&gt;Over the weekend, that estimate &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-07/hackers-breach-thousands-of-microsoft-customers-around-the-world"&gt;has &lt;em&gt;doubled&lt;/em&gt; to 60,000 Microsoft Exchange Server customers hacked around the world&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56321567"&gt;the European Banking Authority now admitting&lt;/a&gt; that it’s one of the victims — and it looks like Microsoft may have taken a little too long to realize the severity and patch it. Krebs has now put together &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/a-basic-timeline-of-the-exchange-mass-hack/"&gt;a basic timeline&lt;/a&gt; of the massive Exchange Server hack, and he says Microsoft has confirmed it was made aware of the vulnerabilities in early January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMFzRU"&gt;That’s nearly two months before Microsoft issued its first set of patches, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2F02%2Fhafnium-targeting-exchange-servers%2F%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DTnL5HPStwNw%26ranSiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-L0oJAsS_1sBt.74BPIZPQg%26epi%3DTnL5HPStwNw-L0oJAsS_1sBt.74BPIZPQg%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__yyl6lwa6xgkftidukk0sohzibe2xprw31xxe2pxb00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528TnL5HPStwNw-L0oJAsS_1sBt.74BPIZPQg%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_yyl6lwa6xgkftidukk0sohzibe2xprw31xxe2pxb00&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F8%2F22319934%2Fmicrosoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;alongside a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that didn’t explain the scope or scale of the attack. Originally, it was even planning to wait for one of its standard Patch Tuesdays but relented and pushed it out a week early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKASwR"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/06/1020442/four-new-hacking-groups-microsoft-email-servers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; Hafnium may not be the only threat, citing a cybersecurity analyst who claims there appear to be at least five hacking groups actively exploiting the Exchange Server flaws as of Saturday. Government officials are reportedly scrambling to do something, with one state official &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/exchange-server-microsoft-hacks-china-biden/"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;Cyberscoop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “a big F’ing deal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTGaMh"&gt;More diplomatically, White House press secretary Jen Psaki &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/03/05/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-march-5-2021/"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “an active threat,” drawing more attention to &lt;a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-02/"&gt;the emergency directive&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency sent out March 3rd. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan has warned about it as well, as has former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Christopher Krebs and the White House National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPMgiD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the real deal. If your organization runs an OWA server exposed to the internet, assume compromise between 02/26-03/03. Check for 8 character aspx files in C:\\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\system_web\. If you get a hit on that search, you’re now in incident response mode. &lt;a href="https://t.co/865Q8cc1Rm"&gt;https://t.co/865Q8cc1Rm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1367673471669526528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yg1f8S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Patching and mitigation is not remediation if the servers have already been compromised. It is essential that any organization with a vulnerable server take immediate measures to determine if they were already targeted. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HYKF2lA7sn"&gt;https://t.co/HYKF2lA7sn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— National Security Council (@WHNSC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1368275202883411975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lk5iTt"&gt;At this point, the message should be clear that anyone who installed a local Microsoft Exchange Server (2010, 2013, 2016, or 2019) needs to patch and scan, but we’re only beginning to understand the scope of the damage. Hackers reportedly installed malware that can let them right back into those servers again, and we don’t yet know what they might have already taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UCmcC"&gt;“We are undertaking a whole of government response to assess and address the impact,” reads part of an email from a White House official, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxExPv"&gt;Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the timing of its patches and disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oprah’s Meghan and Harry interview exemplifies Paramount Plus’ streaming challenges</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tpjYxbQc45qYGJl0CG1u9tJT4CA=/72x0:857x523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931575/oprah_harrrymeghan.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TP9PxQ"&gt;Two of the biggest entertainment events of the weekend &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315338/paramount-plus-hands-on-nickleodeon-mtv-streaming-tv-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; exclusives: Oprah’s highly anticipated interview with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, and Eddie Murphy’s eagerly awaited &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22314289/coming-2-america-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coming 2 America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the former is now only &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.com%2Fshows%2Foprah-with-meghan-and-harry-a-cbs-primetime-special%2Fvideo%2Fi6UW_WTQjLrEeOoObMmlwrFLTTypvuZm%2Fcbs-presents-oprah-with-meghan-and-harry-a-primetime-special%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F8%2F22319711%2Foprah-meghan-harry-interview-paramount-plus-coming-america" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on CBS’s website (free)&lt;/a&gt; and the latter is streaming exclusively on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5V0fyQ"&gt;For a company whose executives just touted the vital importance of leaning into streaming, having launched Paramount Plus within days of the interview and film being released, not finding a way to have one or the other — or both, ideally — available on demand is head-scratch worthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlEXfr"&gt;One absence is more understandable than the other. Harpo (Oprah’s production company) did not make the streaming video on-demand rights available to ViacomCBS, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. The interview was available on Paramount Plus as live programming, but there’s no replay available for subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wbilif"&gt;Their interview became the most streamed event outside of NFL games and the Super Bowl, according to ViacomCBS, but without any context, that statement doesn’t provide any accurate measurement. The interview also garnered an average of 17.1 million linear viewers on Sunday (a truly impressive number considering appointment television becomes more and more of a relic with each new streaming service). Based on that figure, and conversation on social media, it was a pretty big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oi6AuP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a short-term sacrifice play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oV5w22"&gt;ViacomCBS actually made out quite well even without the interview being on Paramount Plus. The special brought in roughly $325,000 for a 30-second ad, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-03-08/oprah-winfreys-interview-with-meghan-and-harry-draws-17-million-viewers-on-cbs"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and is now playing ad-supported on CBS’s website and app. (The rights for something airing as a digital video on a free site and the rights to have it as an exclusive title for a longer period of time on a streaming service are different.) This means the interview could wind up on a different streaming service, but CBS’s digital website will have the interview for 30 days. All of which is great for CBS’s traditional television business, but not great for a company that has spent the last year touting the importance of its brand-new streaming platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqbjFc"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kvanaren/status/1368927262159106051"&gt;Kathryn VanArendonk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “Imagine launching a streaming service, having a wildly popular interview that same week available only through your streaming service, and then having the interview disappear from your platform entirely the second it’s done airing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXBBS9"&gt;It’s a short-term sacrifice play. Obviously, ViacomCBS would have liked to own the streaming rights to drive subscribers to Paramount Plus. But ViacomCBS did not have the upper hand. If CBS passed, Harpo could have gone to ABC (Disney) or NBC (Comcast) instead. Plus, based on a quick Google Trends search and scrolling through Twitter, people did sign up for Paramount Plus through the free trial for the interview. The question is whether or not people will stick around after those initial seven days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEZ31m"&gt;Remember, the key to understanding most companies’ streaming philosophies is exciting new content brings subscribers in, but it’s fan-favorite TV series and films that keep people paying month after month. That’s what makes the decision to not carry &lt;em&gt;Coming 2 America&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to Eddie Murphy’s &lt;em&gt;Coming to America&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;even more confounding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZOBDS"&gt;Some important context to consider: ViacomCBS sold the film to Amazon in October during a period when the company was selling off a number of its films while theaters were closed or operating at limited capacity. &lt;em&gt;Trial of the Chicago 7 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Lovebirds&lt;/em&gt; both went to Netflix, netting Paramount &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/inside-paramounts-2020-survival-strategy-earn-more-selling-off-films-than-releasing-them/"&gt;between $75 and $85 million for both&lt;/a&gt;. Paramount also sold &lt;em&gt;Without Remorse &lt;/em&gt;to Amazon, alongside &lt;em&gt;Coming 2 America&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yv3QZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Paramount has been dysfunctional for 15 years, but...I’m speechless at how inept and stupid Paramount has been”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1lF4F"&gt;For several of the films, it made sense. CBS All Access wasn’t a major investment for ViacomCBS compared to Paramount Plus, and the company needed to generate revenue for movies just sitting on a shelf. The majority of these movies also came out prior to Paramount Plus’ launch. If the original intention was to release &lt;em&gt;Coming 2 America &lt;/em&gt;between mid-December and January, why not just push it back to March and make it a debut title?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wbu580"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coming 2 America &lt;/em&gt;was released the same weekend as Paramount Plus. It could have been used to bring in subscribers, like &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place II &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Mission Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are leaving movie theaters early and landing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;Paramount Plus just 45 days after release&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of leveraging the film, ViacomCBS wound up competing with Amazon for attention. Not having the movie is one less reason for people to sign up for Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz07UR"&gt;As one former executive at a rival studio told &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;“Paramount has been dysfunctional for 15 years, but ... I’m speechless at how inept and stupid Paramount has been.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keOIAF"&gt;Oh, and in terms of where Oprah’s interview with Meghan and Harry might end up after all is said and done? Keep an eye &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307034/discovery-plus-ambient-tv-hgtv-food-tlc-house-hunters-90-day-fiance-diners-driveins-dives"&gt;on Discovery Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Oprah has a stake in the company, and OWN is part of the Discovery family. It’s just the thing Discovery Plus would love to have. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo simulated real-world crashes to prove its self-driving cars can prevent deaths</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Self-propelled car from Google sister company Waymo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NVwx5nXD54BFAwB3wzKXG82EOlE=/53x0:3568x2343/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68931331/1142125645.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HLNS4K"&gt;In a bid to prove that its robot drivers are safer than humans, Waymo simulated dozens of real-world fatal crashes that took place in Arizona over nearly a decade. The Google spinoff discovered that replacing either vehicle in a two-car crash with its robot-guided minivans would nearly eliminate all deaths, &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/03/replaying-real-life.html"&gt;according to data it publicized today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hikKa"&gt;The results are meant to bolster Waymo’s case that autonomous vehicles operate more safely than human-driven ones. With millions of people dying in auto crashes globally every year, AV operators are increasingly leaning on this safety case to spur regulators to pass legislation allowing more fully autonomous vehicles on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0kpbb8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo has turned to counterfactuals, or “what if?” scenarios&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lp6Gn9"&gt;But that case has been difficult to prove out, thanks to the very limited number of autonomous vehicles operating on public roads today. To provide more statistical support for its argument, Waymo has turned to counterfactuals, or “what if?” scenarios, meant to showcase how its robot vehicles would react in real-world situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1U9ouX"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21538999/waymo-self-driving-car-data-miles-crashes-phoenix-google"&gt;the company published 6.1 million miles of driving data&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and 2020, including 18 crashes and 29 near-miss collisions. In those incidents where its safety operators took control of the vehicle to avoid a crash, Waymo’s engineers simulated what would have happened had the driver not disengaged the vehicle’s self-driving system to generate a counterfactual. The company has also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20822755/waymo-self-driving-car-data-set-free-research"&gt;some of its data available to academic researchers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tq0Cfa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Waymo’s driverless car: ghost-riding in the back seat of a robot taxi","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rAd8lP"&gt;That work in counterfactuals continues in this most recent data release. Through a third party, Waymo collected information on every fatal crash that took place in Chandler, Arizona, a suburban community outside Phoenix, between 2008 and 2017. Focusing just on the crashes that took place within its operational design domain, or the approximately 100-square-mile area in which the company permits its cars to drive, Waymo identified 72 crashes to reconstruct in simulation in order to determine how its autonomous system would respond in similar situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qHiKCb"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VNA8a6"&gt;Some of these crashes involved one vehicle, while most involved two. For crashes with two vehicles, Waymo ran separate experiments simulating its autonomous vehicles in the role of each vehicle — first replacing the vehicle that initiated the crash and then replacing the vehicle that responded to the other vehicle’s actions. For crashes with one vehicle, Waymo only simulated the single vehicle. That left it with 91 simulations in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgYq7o"&gt;The company reconstructed these crashes, systematically aligning the vehicle’s trajectory to make sure its Waymo vehicles are exposed to a similar situation than in the actual fatal crash. Waymo used the same simulation platform it uses to train and evaluate its autonomous vehicles on virtual roads in ordinary operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UU2PG4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo’s AVs “avoided or mitigated” 88 out of 91 total simulations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFwmwg"&gt;The results show that Waymo’s autonomous vehicles would have “avoided or mitigated” 88 out of 91 total simulations, said Trent Victor, director of safety research and best practices at Waymo. Moreover, for the crashes that were mitigated, Waymo’s vehicles would have reduced the likelihood of serious injury by a factor of 1.3 to 15 times, Victor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLXYdt"&gt;“That means that even if it didn’t avoid the crash completely, it took action to reduce the severity of the impact,” Victor said. “If the severity was reduced, it made it less likely that the driver would have died.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr12D2"&gt;When Waymo replaced the vehicle responding to the instigator of the crash, it found that it “completely avoided” 82 percent of simulated crashes — the vast majority of which without the need for hard braking or evasive action. In another 10 percent as a responder, the Waymo vehicle’s urgent maneuvers helped mitigate the severity of the crash. Those crashes all took place at an intersection where the other vehicle either turned left across or cut straight across the Waymo vehicle’s path, leaving little time to react, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUpin5"&gt;“We’re not saying that we will eliminate all fatalities, but we are saying that the best way to reduce the chances of a serious injury would be to take an evasive maneuver when that’s possible,” Victor said. “And in all of these crash simulations, the Waymo driver took evasive maneuvers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CBEwbp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Waymo driver took evasive maneuvers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rvhI5J"&gt;There were three incidents of a person dying after being rear-ended by another vehicle. In simulation, Waymo was not able to avoid these crashes when its vehicle was the one being rear-ended. “In rear crashes specifically, there’s not a lot that the responder role can do,” said Matthew Schwall, head of field safety at Waymo. “So the Waymo driver really suffers from the same challenge that humans do in those situations, that it’s hard to make the prediction soon enough to be able to make an evasive maneuver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0KMlQ"&gt;Twenty simulated crashes involved a pedestrian or cyclist being struck by a driver. Waymo’s autonomous vehicles avoided 100 percent of those crashes in simulation, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QpdpF"&gt;There’s no standard approach for evaluating AV safety. &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA569-1.html"&gt;A recent study by RAND&lt;/a&gt; concluded that, in the absence of a framework, customers are most likely to trust the government — even though US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292014/dot-nhtsa-self-driving-car-test-data-voluntary"&gt;regulators appear content to let the private sector dictate what’s safe&lt;/a&gt;. In this vacuum, Waymo hopes that by publicizing this data, policymakers, researchers, and even other companies may begin to take on the task of developing a universal framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3pTce"&gt;To be sure, Waymo did not make its findings subject to a peer-reviewed analysis for publication in an academic or scientific journal, though it would be open to publishing it in the future, a spokesperson said. The simulations were not conducted independently of the company, nor were they reviewed by any third-party for verification prior to the company making them public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8FRH0"&gt;The company did share its findings with a select group of academic experts to get their reactions. Daniel McGehee, director of the National Advanced Driving Simulator Laboratories at the University of Iowa, said Waymo is pushing safety analyses and transparency “to a new level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZugPly"&gt;Jonas Bargman, associate professor for vehicle safety at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, said that Waymo’s use of simulation-based assessment is at “the scientific forefront” but only one of the components needed to assess the safety of automated vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpRWgw"&gt;After reviewing the report, Bargman concluded that the “Waymo simulation platform is highly sophisticated,” citing the company’s 3D sensor-level perception models. He singled out the use of counterfactual what-if scenarios as “highly relevant for the introduction of Waymo self-driving vehicles to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 will ship with a charger in the box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyUctkxardGhhhakJHbRklfKNwo=/178x0:2244x1377/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68930940/oneplus_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus 9 will be formally announced March 23rd. | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ufKkK5"&gt;Along with a confirmed release date, we got our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1368851473698746375?s=20"&gt;first official look at the OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt; today and another tidbit of information: it will come with a charger, unlike recent flagships including the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0c1XG"&gt;In a message thread on the company’s community forum, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/something-new-is-on-the-horizon-what-is-it.1396347/page-28#post-22835224"&gt;said that the 9 will ship with a charger&lt;/a&gt; in the box. Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; stopped including chargers with their flagship devices, citing environmental benefits and saying that customers already had the adaptors anyway. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;jury’s still out on the environmental impact&lt;/a&gt; of the move, but it’s sure to have helped the companies’ bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5aj1C"&gt;OnePlus is in a slightly different position, of course. One of its phones’ differentiating features has been fast wired charging. The OnePlus 9 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;rumored to include 45W fast charging&lt;/a&gt; and would be no exception. Including a charger that allows customers to take advantage of that feature only makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBdrnM"&gt;While there have been plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;credible-looking leaks and rumors&lt;/a&gt;, we still don’t have many confirmed details about the upcoming OnePlus 9 — but that will change soon. OnePlus announced today that the 9 series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315517/oneplus-9-launch-date-hasselblad-camera"&gt;will debut on March 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The company also confirmed a three-year partnership with Hasselblad to collaborate on future OnePlus device cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MfOP9x"&gt;Nearly a month after distancing itself from political statements, the publisher of the controversial military shooter &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah &lt;/em&gt;has backtracked and now says the events in the game are “inseparable from politics.” The game, which takes place during the Iraq War’s Second Battle of Fallujah, has come under scrutiny for seemingly portraying a US-centric focus on a campaign in which an estimated 800 Iraqi civilians were killed, &lt;a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1967340_1967350_1967530,00.html"&gt;according to the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vR0Cw"&gt;“We understand the events recreated in &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt; are inseparable from politics,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VicturaGG/status/1368924485676527623"&gt;publisher Victura said in a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe the stories of this generation’s sacrifices deserve to be told by the Marines, Soldiers, and civilians who were there,” Victura’s statement continued. “We trust you will find the game — like the events it recreates — to be complex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oPZbBQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We understand the events recreated in Six Days in Fallujah are inseparable from politics. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N7nkPilp1Q"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N7nkPilp1Q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Victura (@VicturaGG) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VicturaGG/status/1368924485676527623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tphpnT"&gt;The statement follows comments from Victura’s founder and CEO Peter Tamte about how one of the goals of &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah &lt;/em&gt;is to help players empathize with the decisions American troops made during the war and not “make a political commentary.” Tamte, in an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/15/22279600/six-days-in-fallujah-interview-iraq-war-politics?utm_campaign=polygon.social&amp;amp;utm_content=polygon&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UskFyo"&gt;“For us as a team, it is really about helping players understand the complexity of urban combat. It’s about the experiences of that individual that is now there because of political decisions. And we do want to show how choices that are made by policymakers affect the choices that [a Marine] needs to make on the battlefield. Just as that [Marine] cannot second-guess the choices by the policymakers, we’re not trying to make a political commentary about whether or not the war itself was a good or a bad idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Jc8sRK"&gt;The game uses a mix of military shooter gameplay and documentary segments to tell its story, based on information from “26 Iraqi civilians and dozens of service members [who] have shared the most difficult moments of their lives,” according to Victura. Much of the game will focus on playing as soldiers, but there are also “&lt;a href="https://www.sixdays.com/faq"&gt;high-intensity stealth missions&lt;/a&gt;” where you play as an unarmed Iraqi civilian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kyciL"&gt;And while those missions are “informed by” the interviews with Iraqi civilians, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;very few people are curious what it’s like to be an Iraqi civilian,” Tamte said in a February interview with &lt;a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Nobody’s going to play that game,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVyxMN"&gt;“Ultimately, the reason why people are going to play this game is because they want a more realistic combat experience,” he continued. “That above all else is the experience that we must deliver.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eilaeW"&gt;The game was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stories/six-days-in-fallujah-announced-127714.phtml"&gt;in April 2009&lt;/a&gt;, but its concept was &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/konamis-fallujah-game-under-fire_8"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt;. Konami, the game’s original publisher, &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114311/Konami_Drops_Controversial_Six_Days_in_Fallujah.php"&gt;dropped it later that month&lt;/a&gt;. The game was re-announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278073/six-days-in-fallujah-revival-release-date-highwire-games"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, now being developed by &lt;a href="https://highwiregames.com/"&gt;Highwire Games&lt;/a&gt;, whose co-founders include &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; veterans Jaime Griesemer and Marty O’Donnell, formerly of Bungie. Victura’s Tamte also worked at Bungie, leading the marketing of the first &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, according to his LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BziuYn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and Windows, targeting a release “late in 2021,” &lt;a href="https://www.sixdays.com/faq"&gt;according to an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg says realistic avatars are Facebook’s next big VR bet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FJj3y0oba5HJ6KWPqd2KIDmYqJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68930728/akrales_200904_4160_0216.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ylVt8p"&gt;Facebook’s future virtual reality headsets should capture users’ facial expressions for more realistic digital avatars, says CEO Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pptj0H"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr?utm_source=ti_app"&gt;In a podcast interview for &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Zuckerberg expounded on the next decade in virtual and augmented reality, including future Oculus VR devices. “One of the things that I’m really excited about for future versions is getting eye tracking and face tracking in, because if you’re really excited about social presence, you want to make sure that the device has all the sensors to really kind of animate realistic avatars so you can communicate well like that,” Zuckerberg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SZNLhJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You want to make sure that the device has all the sensors to animate realistic avatars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tQnIvo"&gt;Zuckerberg says hardware changes are a major focus for avatar-building. In VR, “the biggest things that we’re very focused on now are, how do you pack basically more sensors to create a better social experience into the device,” he says. “When I think about where you’re at with VR today, you go into the experience — there are some pretty good games and different experiences. But I’d love to get to the point where you have realistic avatars of yourself, where you can make real authentic eye contact with someone and have real expressions that get reflected on your avatar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8vSou"&gt;Facebook has released multiple iterations of VR avatars, and Zuckerberg says a new generation of avatars is on its way later this year, with more realistic versions beyond that. He compared his desired quality with Epic’s MetaHuman tool, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276265/epic-games-digital-human-creator-unreal-engine-realistic-human-faces"&gt;lets animators produce&lt;/a&gt; highly detailed virtual faces — but he wants Facebook to generate these kinds of avatars through machine learning at a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p2hV5x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t think that people are going to want to get their head drilled open in order to use virtual or augmented reality.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFBDWK"&gt;Otherwise, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;interview confirms several known areas of interest for Facebook. Zuckerberg indicates that Oculus is already envisioning “Quest 3 and 4” hardware — an indication that Facebook remains committed to the Quest standalone VR design for the near future. Facebook also has an active interest in augmented reality, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;pair of smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; launching later this year, but Zuckerberg reiterates that they won’t have standard visual AR elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0aO4G"&gt;He also discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433516/ctrl-labs-brain-computer-interface-armband-hands-on-preview"&gt;the Facebook acquisition of CTRL-Labs&lt;/a&gt;, which makes armbands that detect and interpret neural signals — a partial alternative to invasive brain-computer interfaces like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493224/elon-musk-neuralink-neuroscience-brain-machine"&gt;Elon Musk’s Neuralink&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t think that people are going to want to get their head drilled open in order to use virtual or augmented reality,” Zuckerberg says. He notes that Neuralink has very real applications, particularly for medical technologies like prosthetic limbs. “But ultimately, I don’t think [that] is going to be part of a consumer product that gets offered anytime soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WWE Network on Peacock: your questions answered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3e5QbY6TJgd478gk57EQigugNE=/0x13:2040x1373/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68930505/wwepeacock.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Peacock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmBCSE"&gt;Peacock is sharing more details today about how it will integrate WWE’s enormous selection of content later this month when WWE Network becomes part of the NBCUniversal streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyXLOg"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248330/wwe-network-peacock-move-announced-date-price"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt;, WWE’s new portal will launch on Peacock starting on March 18th. The standalone WWE Network app will shut down in the United States a few weeks later on April 4th. That means current subscribers will be able to use the old app for WWE’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fastlane&lt;/em&gt; pay-per-view this month if they want. But come &lt;em&gt;WrestleMania 37&lt;/em&gt;, which is happening on April 10th and 11th, Peacock will be the only choice. There’s no way to transfer a WWE Network subscription over to Peacock, but the company is offering wrestling fans &lt;a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/896950/11640?sharedid=VergeWWENetworkonPeacock03082021&amp;amp;utm_campaign=20200101evergreen&amp;amp;cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2FWWE"&gt;an exclusive deal&lt;/a&gt; to help ease the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Noaa2c"&gt;It will look like Peacock but feel familiar to WWE fans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aTvrWS"&gt;As for how Peacock plans to showcase WWE programming, you’ll notice a new “WWE” tab in the browse section. Once that’s selected, you’ll be shown the usual carousels of featured shows and curated events. This is all Peacock’s user interface, but the two companies are in constant communication about what content to highlight. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_x37RHDDzX7ws-f5Smh9TsPgxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22353756/Screen_Shot_2021_03_08_at_10.24.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peacock&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B64F9s"&gt;Peacock has said it will eventually be home to pretty much everything available on WWE Network today — but the transition isn’t going to be instant. There will be some noticeable omissions in the early days. For the March 18th launch, Peacock subscribers will get access to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o1myYj"&gt;Every PPV event in the last calendar year; current or most recent season episodes of WWE original series &lt;em&gt;Steve Austin’s The Broken Skull Sessions&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; WWE Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;WWE Icons&lt;/em&gt;; in-ring action with new weekly episodes of &lt;em&gt;NXT &lt;/em&gt;the day after air&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; as well as the 2021 replays of &lt;em&gt;RAW &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; SmackDown&lt;/em&gt; 30 days after air; groundbreaking documentaries, including &lt;em&gt;Undertaker: The Last Ride&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;WWE 24&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; WWE Untold&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reality series, including &lt;em&gt;Total Bellas&lt;/em&gt;; as well as collections of featured series, topical moments like “Stone Cold” Steve Austin Week, and playlists showcasing current Superstars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5itV2K"&gt;You’ll be waiting a few months for all of those pay-per-views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9w5SUf"&gt;Here’s the bad news: WWE Network’s huge vault of WWE, WCW, and ECW pay-per-views won’t be ready for day one. Instead, Peacock is promising to have all of that content available “before &lt;em&gt;SummerSlam&lt;/em&gt;,” which is in August. That means pro wrestling fans could go several weeks without any convenient way of watching those past events since the WWE Network app will be history in the US. (The international version will continue operating just as it does today.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SA2Wdi"&gt;The exception to this is WrestleMania; all previous WrestleMania events will be available at launch on Peacock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="drPyVy"&gt;Match markers are no more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JZUEkO"&gt;Another potential disappointment to frequent WWE Network viewers is that on-demand PPVs and shows will no longer be broken up with “markers” to separate them into several different segments that are easy to skip between. Instead, each will just be one long stream. (Peacock tells me it’s working on visual scrub bar previews to help viewers find what they want when fast-forwarding through WWE videos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VggHjp"&gt;Search won’t be as comprehensive as it was on WWE Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RRSiDu"&gt;And last, search on Peacock won’t be as robust as it was on WWE Network. Whereas WWE Network would let you search for a specific match or WWE superstar right in the search bar, that’s not going to be the case on Peacock — at least initially. This is something fans can expect to improve in the months to come. But even then, it might not fully match what was possible on WWE Network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48MjIg"&gt;Get a discount during WWE’s move to Peacock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V1TS04"&gt;Peacock acknowledges that there’s more work to be done to satisfy WWE Network diehards. So to help sweeten the pot, &lt;a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/896950/11640?sharedid=VergeWWENetworkonPeacock03082021&amp;amp;utm_campaign=20200101evergreen&amp;amp;cid=20200101evergreenpdaffil001&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2FWWE"&gt;it will be offering an exclusive discount to WWE fans&lt;/a&gt;. They can get four months of Peacock Premium for a flat $9.99. That breaks down to $2.50 per month. Peacock Premium normally costs $4.99 monthly, which itself is still less than WWE Network’s longtime $9.99 / month subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o113Pz"&gt;There were always going to be compromises in this Peacock and WWE tag team, and I think I’ve covered the main ones that fans care about here. Cramming a service that was tailor-made for a very specific audience into a more mainstream streaming app comes with challenges. Also, remember we’re still talking about the launch experience; it’s possible Peacock will go back and add some of this functionality if customers are vocal enough. I’m also hoping that other features WWE Network never really got around to (like offline downloads) will be made a reality on Peacock. &lt;/p&gt;
