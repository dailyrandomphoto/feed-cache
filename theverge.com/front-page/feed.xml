    <title>Microsoft’s Edge browser will match Chrome’s upcoming four-week release cycle</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f7MEst"&gt;Microsoft is going to &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/03/12/new-release-cycles-microsoft-edge-extended-stable/"&gt;adjust its release cycles&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft Edge to match the every-four-weeks release cadence for Chrome that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314992/google-chrome-release-cycle-four-weeks-update"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXExBF"&gt;“As contributors to the Chromium project, we look forward to the new 4-week major release cycle cadence that Google announced to help deliver that innovation to our customers even faster,” Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgLynt"&gt;The change will go into effect with Edge 94, which is &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-release-schedule"&gt;targeted for a September release&lt;/a&gt;. Google has committed to making the switch with Chrome in Q3 with Chrome 94, but hasn’t given a specific month like Microsoft has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLLSHu"&gt;Like Google, Microsoft is also offering enterprises the option of a longer release cycle enterprise customers. On that Extended Stable schedule, there will be a new release every eight weeks. However, a four-week cadence will be the default, Microsoft says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXxLRK"&gt;Edge isn’t the only Chromium-based browser making the switch to a four-week release cycle; Brave told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on March 5th that it plans to match the new schedule as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pnJv4G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is speeding up Chrome’s release cycle to every four weeks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314992/google-chrome-release-cycle-four-weeks-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Pocket’s sort by time to read feature seems designed for the return of commutes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPYtvq3Yi4YITDbBlyq2Vl6nNrg=/70x70:1036x714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957097/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_10.19.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pocket&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2AtnIX"&gt;Pocket, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14752590/mozilla-acquires-pocket-read-it-later"&gt;an app for saving articles to read later&lt;/a&gt;, is rolling out a sorting option to Android users over the next few weeks that could solve my paralysis when choosing something to read. The new sort by time-to-read feature, spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658/photo/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Dan Seifert&lt;/a&gt;, means articles can be organized where they fit best, whether it’s the five minutes it takes to microwave lunch, or a 20-minute wait for the late bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkGs37"&gt;The feature appears in both the search section of the app, and as a sorting feature in your main list. A reader can sort their saved article search by length, choosing from Quick (less than five minutes), Medium (six to ten minutes), Long (eleven to twelve minutes), and Very Long (over twenty-one minutes). Your list of saved articles can also be organized by newest saved, oldest saved, longest to read, and shortest read, according to Pocket’s VP and General Manager Matt Koidin. If the feature proves popular, after Pocket “modernizes its iOS codebase,” Koidin says the company will bring these sorting options to iOS and the web as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kphJhj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have wanted this feature in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pocket?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Pocket&lt;/a&gt; for YEARS, thrilled it's finally a thing &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xpaxkz4awm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Xpaxkz4awm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dan seifert (@dcseifert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1370081315719110658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kSDPor"&gt;In my pre-pandemic life, when I used to ride the bus to work almost every day, I’d constantly misjudge what I was getting myself into when deciding what to read. Pocket’s pre-existing time-to-read stamps for articles help, but when you have a dragon’s hoard of writing you wanted to read at some point, things get complicated. Finding an article that can fit into a typical commute time might help people actually finish reading what they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEhl81"&gt;I assumed reading time was personalized, but Koidin says that Pocket actually bases its estimates on an average 220 words-per-minute reading speed. Now the hair on the back of my neck goes up when I think about great writing as a reading length first, rather than a holistic work of creative effort, but I think it’s easy to see how useful this could be (if I wasn’t shackled to an iPhone currently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15NbXJ"&gt;Commutes might not be in the equation for everyone just yet, but for those who still travel to work regularly, the feature might help. It at least has me missing my reading time on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A secretive metaverse creator bought the $69 million Beeple NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A square collage of 5,000 works from Beeple, start with the oldest in the top left corner and continuing to recent works in the bottom right corner." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFWY8bu9Kn_TXJzXeFc6sdsPjl8=/0x500:3000x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956798/2021_NYR_20447_0001_001_beeple_everydays_the_first_5000_days034733_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CF2LZf"&gt;MetaKovan, the pseudonymous founder of &lt;a href="https://metapurse.fund/"&gt;MetaPurse&lt;/a&gt;, is the buyer behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;the $69 million winning bid for a Beeple NFT&lt;/a&gt; at Christie’s yesterday. It was the third-highest sale price ever for a work from a living artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IktBH8"&gt;“When you think of high-valued NFTs, this one is going to be pretty hard to beat,” MetaKovan said in a statement published by Christie’s. “And here’s why — it represents 13 years of everyday work. Techniques are replicable and skill is surpassable, but the only thing you can’t hack digitally is time. This is the crown jewel, the most valuable piece of art for this generation. It is worth $1 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="TporG9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kjtxVk"&gt;The $69 million NFT represented &lt;a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924"&gt;a collage&lt;/a&gt; containing 5,000 mostly digital illustrations from Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, that were created for his &lt;em&gt;Everydays&lt;/em&gt; series, in which he creates a new artwork every day. Winkelmann’s popularity online and his prolific output surely contributed to the sky-high price, but a key driver was also the growing hype around NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIkVQp"&gt;MetaKovan previously spent more than $2.2 million to acquire 20 single-edition Beeple works in December. Though the works were purchased under an assortment of names, there was apparently just this single entity&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;behind the acquisitions. The organization, MetaPurse, describes itself as a “crypto-exclusive” fund. Its &lt;a href="https://b20.metapurse.fund/"&gt;first project&lt;/a&gt; involved building those 20 original Beeple works into a digital museum, then effectively selling shares of that museum as digital tokens so that a multitude of buyers can have a stake in these works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="208OEE"&gt;NFTs are digital files that live on a blockchain and validate ownership of a related good — in this case, the collage. Some artists and collectors see them as the future of digital art by finally offering a way for buyers to acquire works that lack a physical component. Prices of NFTs from major artists have exploded in recent weeks, with Grimes selling $6 million worth of NFTs and Steve Aoki selling a single video for $888,888.88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziGaD9"&gt;Winkelmann told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Monday that he expects to work with the buyer to find ways to physically display the collage. “Do you want it on a TV in your house? We can do that ... want to do it at Art Basel? Let’s project it on the side of a fucking building,” Winkelmann said. “It doesn’t have to be one way. It can be a bunch of different ways over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft and newspapers join forces to fight Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Judiciary Subcommittee Holds Hearing On Saving A Free And Diverse Press" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jz2sKl2Q_qZpSLP_FHijVcOLz5o=/0x0:5277x3518/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956684/1231667961.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbnRvq"&gt;Over the last decade, hundreds of newspapers have disappeared largely due to Big Tech’s disruption of the ad market. Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much when it comes to tech reform, whether it be content moderation or spinning off acquisitions, but they do seem to agree that local journalism needs saving.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9sRsI"&gt;On Friday, a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the way Google and Facebook distribute news, and a new bill introduced earlier this week has already found Republican support. It’s one of the biggest legislative threats to tech that’s come out of the years-long antitrust debate, and much of its political force comes from the precarious state of local journalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVZ44O"&gt;“The crisis in American journalism has become a real crisis in our democracy and civic life,” Cicilline said in his opening remarks Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBaIBv"&gt;Ciciline’s bill, the “Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2021,” would allow news organizations to collectively negotiate with platforms like Facebook and Google the terms in which their content is distributed online. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who leads the Senate’s antitrust panel, also sponsored the legislation in the Senate and  Republicans, like Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), have already signed on in support of the bill as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9iZrd"&gt;“This bill is a step in the right direction to dethroning those digital kings,” Buck said in his opening remarks Friday. “It is not a subsidy for outlets, but rather a leveling of the playing field in favor of democracy and free expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6Hjy"&gt;But while there was growing bipartisan support for the measure on Capitol Hill Friday, the real drama happened beyond the dais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FzOEsx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bUSDmF"&gt;There’s more pressure now than ever for Congress to act. In January, Google threatened to remove its search engine from Australia, responding to a new law that would force the tech giant to pay news publishers for their content. That law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;was approved in February&lt;/a&gt;, and Google quickly backed off to cut a deal with News Corp. and other publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTtZzz"&gt;While this all was happening, Microsoft put out a statement in support of Australia’s efforts to protect publishers. “One thing is clear: while other tech companies may sometimes threaten to leave Australia, Microsoft will never make such a threat,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/2021/02/03/microsoft-supports-australian-government-proposal-addressing-news-media-and-digital-platforms/"&gt;in the statement&lt;/a&gt; last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlnqMV"&gt;Smith was brought in as a witness for Friday’s hearing, announcing his support for Cicilline’s media negotiation bill. Moments before the hearing was set to begin, Google put out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327306/google-microsoft-attack-open-web-online-news-australia-laws"&gt;own scathing statement&lt;/a&gt; against Microsoft, suggesting that the company was “making self-serving claims” that could “break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnJxSa"&gt;Google has good reason to be afraid of this bill, especially in light of its Australia bluff. The Cicilline bill has bipartisan support, and its only the subcommittee’s first swing at Big Tech before they wrestle with more sweeping reforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r6vfyx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HIGHLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="avpYEk"&gt;Glenn Greenwald, former &lt;em&gt;Intercept &lt;/em&gt;editor turned Substack newsletter writer, also testified at Friday’s hearing. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) focused his line of questioning at Greenwald, asking if he feared a bill like the one proposed would only cement the power of larger media firms while leaving local journalism in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVT7nq"&gt;“The concern I have is that the discussion in the legislation seems grounded in a premise that the only or the primary problem, to both local and national journalism, is that Google and Facebook are vacuuming up advertising revenue and that you simply fix that problem the problem of media failure will be rectified as well,” Greenwald said. “I think that until the problem that this subcommittee identified in its report is addressed head on, which is breaking up the monopoly powers of this industry, none of these problems will really be fixed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Awy7fJ"&gt;Cicilline went back at Greenwald, saying that his bill is just a first step. “The bill that, at least Mr. Buck and I have put forth… provides a temporary fix for a 48-month period. And in fact, anything these larger media companies would negotiate would be available to the smallest role newspaper in any city in town in America.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSp3sr"&gt;He continued, “We’re not going to do either or. We’re going to do both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BvXcyp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DIDN’T THEY ASK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PfVqQt"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Politico’s &lt;/em&gt;Cristiano Lima noted on Twitter, the committee hardly asked any questions about Facebook! &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;Facebook had its own beef&lt;/a&gt; with Australia last month, removing the ability for some users and publishers to share news content in the country. In February, the Australian government agreed to several changes that would allow users to continue to publish news, so a thorough conversation on those concessions and how they could affect American users would have been beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pbO7hX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft president Brad Smith's written testimony before House Judiciary today mentions Google 7⃣5⃣ times ‼️ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By contrast, it mentions Facebook 3⃣ times&lt;/p&gt;— Cristiano Lima (@viaCristiano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1370399851494699013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="efv1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R8AENj"&gt;The House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on antitrust still has another hearing before it starts introducing legislation. Those bills are expected to land this spring. Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/1369828793087631368?s=20"&gt;also told &lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt; that the Senate’s competition committee will also start holding its own hearings on tech’s dominance, looking into app store fees and news publishing. Those hearings have yet to be scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM-backed startup Lordstown Motors accused of faking preorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QgCTIAXaFFrr7LOQAMdGSbPj04=/0x0:4671x3114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956485/EnduranceDetail10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x2bgf5"&gt;General Motors-backed EV startup Lordstown Motors has been accused of fabricating some of the 100,000 preorders for its forthcoming Endurance electric pickup and misleading investors, the public, and government regulators about how much progress it’s made in developing the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weub2Y"&gt;The accusations come in &lt;a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/"&gt;a new report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research&lt;/a&gt; — the same firm that published a report about hydrogen trucking startup Nikola that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;led to the founder resigning his position&lt;/a&gt; and a major restructuring of that company’s business. Hindenburg says in the report, published Friday, that it has taken an unspecified short position in Lordstown Motors, meaning it stands to make money from the startup’s stock price falling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6GGlB"&gt;The accusations from Hindenburg could also raise questions about General Motors and the due diligence it does on the startups it backs. GM, the biggest automaker in the US, had previously planned to take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;a big stake in Nikola before Hindenburg’s report came out last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zyxCRg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lordstown Motors got big support from the Trump administration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4hRFz"&gt;GM has backed Lordstown Motors since its inception and has a seat on the startup’s board. It loaned Lordstown Motors $40 million so the startup could buy a plant that GM shuttered in Lordstown, Ohio — a deal praised by then-president Donald Trump that eventually led to a White House photo-op and then-Vice President Mike Pence appearing at the Endurance unveiling event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J0U5c"&gt;GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;also invested $75 million in Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt; as part of its merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which turned the startup into a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq stock exchange and helped it raise nearly $700 million total. (The startup has since said &lt;a href="https://www.tribtoday.com/news/local-news/2021/01/lmc-moves-forward-in-loan-program/"&gt;it’s in the “due diligence” phase of obtaining a loan&lt;/a&gt; from the Department of Energy (DOE), too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5gnD4"&gt;“The $75 million investment from General Motors in LMC included certain in kind contributions that have already been provided to Lordstown. These include the plant itself. We have nothing to say about the report,” GM’s director of finance and sales communications James Cain said in an email. Representatives for Lordstown Motors and the DOE did not immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74ULps"&gt;Lordstown Motors has claimed to have presold 100,000 pickup trucks to date. But Hindenburg accuses Lordstown Motors founder and CEO Steve Burns of paying consultants to preorder the startup’s electric pickup truck — something Burns confirmed to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ev-startup-lordstown-motors-is-targeted-by-short-seller-hindenburg-research-shares-fall-16-11615569913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYDU62"&gt;The firm claims multiple big-batch orders for the truck were from companies that either exist mostly on paper or don’t operate vehicle fleets to begin with. One order for 14,000 trucks — which would cost more than $700 million — was placed by a Texas company with just two employees on LinkedIn. Another order for 1,000 Endurances was from a similarly small company, the CEO of which allegedly told Hindenburg he had no plans to buy the trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z5jzr"&gt;Hindenburg also includes claims in its report that some preorders are nonbinding and require no money upfront, though this is a practice that has been common among startups in the space that try to book orders before getting a vehicle to production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="gTmnYy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some big orders came from companies that basically only exist on paper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNf9Pk"&gt;While Burns has stuck to a September 2021 date for getting the startup’s pickup into production, Hindenburg says it spoke to former employees who believe the truck is at least three years away from being ready, including one who allegedly claimed that the startup has not completed cold weather and other testing required by the government. The report also cites &lt;a href="https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire"&gt;a local news report of one of the startup’s prototype trucks catching fire in February as further evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmbDDA"&gt;What’s more, Hindenburg discovered a previously unreported lawsuit filed against Lordstown Motors by EV startup Karma Automotive. In it, Karma accuses Lordstown Motors of trying to steal its infotainment system technology after initially trying to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnLCIg"&gt;Lordstown Motors’ relationship to Burns’ previous company, fellow Ohio EV startup Workhorse, is also called into question in the report. Burns founded Lordstown Motors shortly after leaving Workhorse in 2019, thought Hindenburg claims he was fired. Workhorse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBZumf"&gt;As it entered into the deal with GM to buy the Lordstown factory, Burns’ new startup struck an agreement with Workhorse to license IP for a pickup truck that his former company was never able to get off the ground. Hindenburg claims that Workhorse was more than happy to unload the pickup truck. This deal has paid off handsomely so far for Workhorse, too, as Lordstown Motors paid $15.8 million for the IP, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307333/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-contract-oshkosh"&gt;another $4.8 million when the new startup went public&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors also handed Workhorse a 10 percent stake that is now worth some $300 million based on the new startup’s stock price as of the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV4fZj"&gt;Hindenburg obviously stands to benefit from any hit to Lordstown Motors’ stock price. The firm’s research into Nikola did lead to that startup performing an internal investigation, which &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1ed9c9ec-de9e-44c3-b1f9-36a8da34b788"&gt;turned up evidence that founder Trevor Milton did in fact make “inaccurate” statements about his company&lt;/a&gt; before he ultimately resigned. But Nikola claims the results of the investigation do not line up with Hindenburg’s accusation that that the startup is an “intricate fraud.” Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations into Nikola are currently ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let this robot Twitter composer serenade you with randomly generated music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1hHEmsOFGocrl2FkoS9nqH7cVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956396/acastro_181016_1777_music_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ViaTzJ"&gt;I have been listening to robot-made music all week. No, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295222/daft-punk-breakup-split-28-years"&gt;not Daft Punk&lt;/a&gt;, but randomly generated music posted every hour by a Twitter bot, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456"&gt;@MelodyBot3456&lt;/a&gt;. As you’d expect from auto-generated music, the short songs (if you can call them that) are often bizarre and regularly veer in unexpected and hilarious directions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH8zTR"&gt;Each song applies a random instrument, tempo, time signature, and key to melodies that, most of the time, make absolutely no sense. Take &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369472009332133889"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, for example, made with an instrument called “Mario Paint” that only vaguely sounds like something from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gc-1Dq3uQQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Paint&lt;/em&gt;’s famous music composer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t4XQHC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Mario Paint &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 60.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of B. &lt;a href="https://t.co/C1bfzqczaF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C1bfzqczaF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369472009332133889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pSBDBK"&gt;Or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370075987749171200?s=20"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which a friend described as like a computer trying to make a Black Keys song in a weird time signature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A2nBh6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Mini Saw &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 90.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of E. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YxTw6bhBle"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YxTw6bhBle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370075987749171200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="abHJc5"&gt;Or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1368596253857042433"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which brings me to tears of joy every time I hear it, played by an instrument called “1812 Cannons” (which are surely inspired by the glorious cannons at the end of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8&amp;amp;t=844s"&gt;Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture”&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="erGVR0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: 1812 Cannons &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 90.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of F. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qOBv2BE8PF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qOBv2BE8PF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1368596253857042433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq0ShI"&gt;Sometimes, however, the bot inexplicably churns out something that’s kind of good. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369185067721887747"&gt;This song&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t feel out of place in the right video game: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="09UiQ0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Sine Wave &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 120.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of A. &lt;a href="https://t.co/i2ZF8vDIZJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/i2ZF8vDIZJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369185067721887747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHrbR1"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370393022613970947"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; just slaps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="67whgB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Bass Hits 1 &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 150.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of Gb. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CawyJnZxmE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CawyJnZxmE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1370393022613970947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WODUIK"&gt;I strongly recommend just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456"&gt;scrolling through the bot’s tweets yourself&lt;/a&gt; and listening to anything that sounds vaguely interesting. Most of them will probably make you laugh, and every once in a while you’ll find a gem. The account has been around since July 2019, so there’s a lot to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q948Bd"&gt;I will leave you with my absolute favorite melody from the week, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369713589418749952"&gt;performed by robot claves&lt;/a&gt;. It’s absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="myYKcJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instrument: Claves &lt;br&gt;Tempo: 150.0&lt;br&gt;Played in the key of G. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2rnU87ayOZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2rnU87ayOZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MelodyBot3456/status/1369713589418749952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>MSI Summit B15 review: average business</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Functional but could be better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Z93JmH"&gt;This year, multiple companies primarily known for gaming laptops have been branching out into the portable business and productivity sector. It’s a crowded field already, but Razer made quite a splash with its excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;, which has an elegant chassis, a 16:10 screen, and just a touch of its company’s signature RGB lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OC0P0f"&gt;In this review I’m looking at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418451/msi-summit-series-prestige-modern-announced-specs"&gt;Summit Series&lt;/a&gt;, which is MSI’s attempt to enter the same space. The series includes the Summit E line — which includes discrete GPU options and is priced to compete with top dogs like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; — and the Summit B line, which starts at $999 and sits squarely in the midrange market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwht5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10388520"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60wLLz"&gt;I’m discussing the Summit B15 here — I looked at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451322/msi-summit-series-e15-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers-security"&gt;Summit E15&lt;/a&gt; last fall. The base B15 includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. I tested the more expensive configuration, which costs $1,249 and has a Core i7-1165G7 (one of Intel’s top 11th Gen processors), 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The system puts solid specs in a nice chassis, but there are a few misses that make it a bit expensive for what it offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of MSI’s Summit B15 with the LED indicator on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lcyVpFp3_M-FXJeQLEzBzKGvac8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361112/mchin_190604_4465_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 720p IR webcam does not support Windows Hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad of the MSI Summit B15 from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnGqU293H97TJqyVqJA_0P5fUng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361116/mchin_190604_4465_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s the fingerprint sensor in the top left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj8JKW"&gt;The most appealing facets of the Summit-Series laptops are their look and build. They have a smooth black finish, an aluminum build, a classy backlit keyboard, and a lustrous new MSI logo on the lid and bottom bezel (no dragon to be found, a first for MSI). MSI claims the B15 has “military-grade durability,” and while that’s a difficult claim to test, there’s very little flex in the B15’s lid and keyboard. And at 3.53 pounds and 0.67 inches thick, it’s light for its size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeMIXg"&gt;All in all, though, the B15 has a bit of a utilitarian look, especially compared to the E15. The latter has some small flourishes that add up to a classier vibe — there are gold accents around the touchpad and edges of the hinge, for example, where the B15 is straight black. One other thing about the B15’s chassis — it’s one of the worst fingerprint magnets I’ve ever seen. Touch the lid one time, and a visible smudge will remain. I used the sides of my fists to reposition the laptop while taking photos and still had to wipe it down between shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqSPVs"&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it’s a nice-looking and nice-feeling chassis. But there’s nothing exciting about it, and you’ll be wiping it down a lot if you want to maintain a clean look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 from the right side, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJV_7SgZ1mzxrqBthkB7gIgMims=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361114/mchin_190604_4465_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-A and a microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xtyl99"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MSI’s Summit Series looks like it was made for the boardroom","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451322/msi-summit-series-e15-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers-security"},{"title":"MSI’s Summit Series are slim business laptops for remote workers ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418451/msi-summit-series-prestige-modern-announced-specs"},{"title":"MSI GS66 Stealth proves the RTX 3080 can handle QHD just fine","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pkezmy"&gt;The useful port selection is a highlight, given the thin chassis. It includes a USB-C (supporting Thunderbolt 4, power delivery, DP 1.4a, and USB 4.0), two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB 3.2 Gen 1, one combination audio jack, one microSD reader, and one HDMI jack, in addition to the barrel-plug power port. You also get an RJ45 Ethernet dongle in the box, which is handy. I also appreciate having USB-A ports on both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrLrJW"&gt;I also like the keyboard backlighting, which looks quite classy and wouldn’t be out of place in an office setting. The keys have a nice texture and 1.5mm of travel. Three nitpicks to note: First, the Fn key is half-sized, and I found it a pain to hit. Second, there was occasionally some internal rattle inside the deck, which was annoying. Third, the keys are more mushy than they are clicky, and they’re a bit shallower than the best keyboard keys around. Subjectively, I made more errors on this keyboard than I normally do. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdLDmTXjEX7et2zQFEYXP4aObF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361115/mchin_190604_4465_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audio jack, HDMI, USB-C, USB-A, and power port on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jv12Kr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10388485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I05xAM"&gt;The display, similarly, is functional with caveats. It covers 98 percent of the sRGB gamut and 76 percent of AdobeRGB, and it maxes out at 258 nits. That’s an acceptable range of color coverage and is functional enough for office use, but it’s too dim to use easily in bright settings. I would expect more from a $1,249 laptop. Additionally, it uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is falling out of fashion among premium business laptops for a reason — it’s cramped for multitasking purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgrIZN"&gt;The one component I really don’t like is the touchpad. It’s a bit small for a 15-inch laptop, and I sometimes hit the fingerprint sensor (built into the top-left corner) and the top plastic as I was scrolling. It also isn’t the smoothest I’ve ever used, and my fingers would skid across it a fair amount. Both the material and the click feel a bit plasticky compared to what you might find in a nicer model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bvUOq"&gt;The Summit’s performance is good. I didn’t encounter any problems while running it through my usual office work. The integrated Iris Xe graphics aren’t suitable for serious gaming but can run lighter fare if that’s your thing. I could occasionally feel the system chugging under the keyboard while doing more intense tasks, but it never got too loud or too hot. You can swap to the “Silent” cooling profile in MSI’s control panel if fan noise is bothering you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="dwmGAB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10388525"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CvQMX"&gt;With that said, two disappointments came out of my testing period. First, the audio from the B15’s two speakers isn’t terrible and works just fine for video calls, but it delivers tinny percussion and practically no bass. I also heard occasional distortion at maximum volume, though I could eliminate it by bumping the sound down a notch. My test unit’s microphone also wasn’t working on Zoom calls, though it worked in other applications — I’ve asked MSI about this and will update this article if they figure it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pVB51"&gt;Second disappointment: the battery life. Running the B15 as my daily driver at 200 nits of brightness, I only averaged five hours and 13 minutes. This isn’t entirely unexpected, as it only has a three-cell 52Wh battery — similar to what some 13-inch laptops come with at this point. On this 15-inch laptop, it’s not enough to power you through a full day if your workload is similar to mine (around a dozen Chrome tabs, Slack, occasional Zoom call, that sort of thing). One thing to note is that the B15 comes loaded with Norton, which I’ve seen be a serious battery drain in the past. I ran a battery trial before uninstalling that software and only got four and a half hours. After I nuked the bloatware, the B15 got closer to six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSXyYY"&gt;All told, the Summit Series is a fine first step for MSI. In a market where business-focused laptops commonly cost multiple thousands of dollars, there’s absolutely an audience for something like the B15, which is light, attractive, and functional for just over the $1,000 mark. It looks and feels like a laptop you’d bring to a business meeting, and it has a top Intel processor with cooling that can handle it. Professionals on a budget could certainly do worse. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit B15 keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhuBLe16IJLc02314HxAs_gZk2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361113/mchin_190604_4465_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Determined to succeed” is the Summit Series motto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="63sCEo"&gt;But given the unremarkable audio, battery life, and the other areas of the chassis, I still think that people who are willing to spend a bit more will benefit from doing so, especially folks who can live with less RAM and storage. A better screen, better speakers, and better battery life can make a big difference in the daily experience, and while the B15’s nice chassis, plentiful storage, and business-specific features are worth a premium for some folks, they won’t be everyone’s top priority. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who needs a plastic wristband when you can use your iPhone to do the same thing?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gC1KwZ"&gt;In 2013, Walt Disney World resort &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3845622/disney-world-magicbands-mymagic-data-gathering"&gt;offered the MagicBands&lt;/a&gt; — a plastic bracelet that made it easy to perform numerous services such as park tickets. And now, almost a decade later, the company is finally making your trip to the most magical place on Earth a little more modern with &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/03/coming-soon-disney-magicmobile-service-a-convenient-new-way-to-experience-walt-disney-world-resort/"&gt;MagicMobile&lt;/a&gt;, a digital pass accessible through your iPhone and Apple Watch starting later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6nlTg"&gt;As an alternative to spending money on a plastic NFC wristband, the MagicMobile pass will be added to your Apple Wallet. Guests can then use their iPhone or Apple Watch to gain entry into the park. Disney has not said exactly when MagicMobile will officially be available but confirmed Apple devices would get access to the service and features first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwX3sz"&gt;Disney confirmed in &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/03/coming-soon-disney-magicmobile-service-a-convenient-new-way-to-experience-walt-disney-world-resort/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the MagicBands will still be an option, and guests can choose which option is more convenient for them or even use both and alternate between the MagicBand and MagicMobile pass. (Disney says it’s introducing new MagicBand colors and designs featuring Disney characters.) The company also notes that MagicMobile will not replace the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fplan%2Fmy-disney-experience%2F%3FCMP%3DILC-DPFY21Q2wo0311210317210005C&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F12%2F22327351%2Fdisney-magicmobile-pass-announced-iphone-apple-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My Disney Experience app&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a digital room key for guests staying at a Disney Resort hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s next big AI project is training its machines on users’ public videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DA2bTs3wRpPCld8egdN8FKVK4po=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956126/acastro_171002_1777_0004_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ys26ft"&gt;Teaching AI systems to understand what’s happening in videos as completely as a human can is one of the hardest challenges — and biggest potential breakthroughs — in the world of machine learning. Today, Facebook announced a &lt;a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/learning-from-videos-to-understand-the-world"&gt;new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that it hopes will give it an edge in this consequential work: training its AI on Facebook users’ public videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZNvxd"&gt;Access to training data is one of the biggest competitive advantages in AI, and by collecting this resource from millions and millions of their users, tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been able to forge ahead in various areas. And while Facebook has already trained machine vision models on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17311808/facebook-instagram-ai-training-hashtag-images"&gt;billions of images&lt;/a&gt; collected from Instagram, it hasn’t previously announced projects of similar ambition for video understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3K08av"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“part of our broader efforts toward building machines that learn like humans do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnnwk3"&gt;“By learning from global streams of publicly available videos spanning nearly every country and hundreds of languages, our AI systems will not just improve accuracy but also adapt to our fast moving world and recognize the nuances and visual cues across different cultures and regions,” said the company in a blog. The project, titled &lt;a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/learning-from-videos-to-understand-the-world"&gt;Learning from Videos&lt;/a&gt;, is also part of Facebook’s “broader efforts toward building machines that learn like humans do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6oLfa"&gt;The resulting machine learning models will be used to create new content recommendation systems and moderation tools, says Facebook, but could do so much more in the future. AI that can understand the content of videos could give Facebook unprecedented insight into users’ lives, allowing them to analyze their hobbies and interests, preferences in brands and clothes, and countless other personal details. Of course, Facebook already has access to such information through its current ad-targeting operation, but being able to parse video through AI would add an incredibly rich (and invasive) source of data to its stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsOOx1"&gt;Facebook is vague about its future plans for AI models trained on users’ videos. The company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; such models could be put to a number of uses, from captioning videos to creating advanced search functions, but did not answer a question on whether or not they would be used to collect information for ad-targeting. Similarly, when asked if users had to consent to having their videos used to train Facebook’s AI or if they could opt out, the company responded only by noting that its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php"&gt;Data Policy&lt;/a&gt; says users’ uploaded content can be used for “product research and development.” Facebook also did not respond to questions asking exactly how much video will be collected for training its AI systems or how access to this data by the company’s researchers will be overseen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8NNmL"&gt;In its blog post announcing the project, though, the social network did point to one future, speculative use: using AI to retrieve “digital memories” captured by smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32DPnG"&gt;Facebook plans to release a pair of consumer smart glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;sometime this year&lt;/a&gt;. Details about the device are vague, but it’s likely these or future glasses will include integrated cameras to capture the wearer’s point of view. If AI systems can be trained to understand the content of video, then it will allow users to search for past recordings, just as many photo apps allow people to search for specific locations, objects, or people. (This is information, incidentally, that has often been indexed by AI systems trained on user data.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5qV26NsYHPQND7jeE97uRSvMApk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21885678/B0005907_logos_V5_close_cropped_4K.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook has released images showing prototype pairs of its augmented-reality smart glasses. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MaQVyU"&gt;As recording video with smart glasses “becomes the norm,” says Facebook, “people should be able to recall specific moments from their vast bank of digital memories just as easy as they capture them.” It gives the example of a user conducting a search with the phrase “Show me every time we sang happy birthday to Grandma,” before being served relevant clips. As the company notes, such a search would require that AI systems establish connections between types of data, teaching them “to match the phrase ‘happy birthday’ to cakes, candles, people singing various birthday songs, and more.” Just like humans do, AI would need to understand rich concepts comprised of different types of sensory input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlYjh0"&gt;Looking to the future, the combination of smart glasses and machine learning would enable what’s referred to as “worldscraping” — capturing granular data about the world by turning wearers of smart glasses into roving CCTV cameras. As the practice was described in a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/25/part-human-part-machine-is-apple-turning-us-all-into-cyborgs"&gt;report last year from &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;: “&lt;/em&gt;Every time someone browsed a supermarket, their smart glasses would be recording real-time pricing data, stock levels and browsing habits; every time they opened up a newspaper, their glasses would know which stories they read, which adverts they looked at and which celebrity beach pictures their gaze lingered on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPJyBB"&gt;This is an extreme outcome and not an avenue of research Facebook says it’s currently exploring. But it does illustrate the potential significance of pairing advanced AI video analysis with smart glasses — which the social network is apparently keen to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zs2CtD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has deployed AI video models to recommend clips in Reels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OT4VwN"&gt;By comparison, the only use of its new AI video analysis tools that Facebook is currently disclosing is relatively mundane. Along with the announcement of Learning from Videos today, Facebook says it’s deployed a new content recommendation system based on its video work in its TikTok-clone Reels. “Popular videos often consist of the same music set to the same dance moves, but created and acted by different people,” says Facebook. By analyzing the content of videos, Facebook’s AI can suggest similar clips to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIOBvL"&gt;Such content recommendation algorithms are not without potential problems, though. A &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;recent report from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlighted how the social network’s emphasis on growth and user engagement has stopped its AI team from fully addressing how algorithms can spread misinformation and encourage political polarization. As the &lt;em&gt;Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;article says: “The [machine learning] models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism.” This creates a conflict between the duties of Facebook’s AI ethics researchers and the company’s credo of maximizing growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T77RNu"&gt;Facebook isn’t the only big tech company pursuing advanced AI video analysis, nor is it the only one to leverage users’ data to do so. Google, for example, maintains a publicly accessible research dataset containing 8 million &lt;a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/youtube-8m-dataset-c2ee9c79d136"&gt;curated and partially labeled YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; in order to “help accelerate research on large scale video understanding.” The search giant’s ad operations could similarly benefit from AI that understands the content of videos, even if the end result is simply serving more relevant ads in YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKUu3W"&gt;Facebook, though, thinks it has one particular advantage over its competitors. Not only does it have ample training data, but it’s pushing more and more resources into an AI method known as self-supervised learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="agbNY2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;self-supervised learning is “the dark matter of intelligence.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJkRfQ"&gt;Usually, when AI models are trained on data, those inputs have be to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1-cZkc7gyfI"&gt;labeled by humans&lt;/a&gt;: tagging objects in pictures or transcribing audio recordings, for example. If you’ve ever solved a CAPTCHA identifying fire hydrants or pedestrian crossing then you’ve likely labeled data that’s helped to train AI. But self-supervised learning does away with the labels, speeding up the training process, and, some researchers believe, resulting in deeper and more meaningful analysis as the AI systems teach themselves to join the dots. Facebook is so optimistic about self-supervised learning it’s &lt;a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/self-supervised-learning-the-dark-matter-of-intelligence/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; it “the dark matter of intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zo9zOL"&gt;The company says its future work on AI video analysis will focus on semi- and self-supervised learning methods, and that such techniques “have already improved our computer vision and speech recognition systems.” With such an abundance of video content available from Facebook’s 2.8 billion users, skipping the labeling part of AI training certainly makes sense. And if the social network can teach its machine learning models to understand video seamlessly, who knows what they might learn? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Berners-Lee says internet access should be a basic right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jpOyH2"&gt;Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, &lt;a href="https://webfoundation.org/2021/03/web-birthday-32/"&gt;writes in a new post&lt;/a&gt; on the internet’s 32nd anniversary that governments must work to ensure global broadband access by the year 2030 in order to bridge the digital divide and better hold tech companies accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rhfuh5"&gt;“Governments need to pass effective laws that govern technology and hold companies to account for creating responsible products and services,” Berners-Lee writes in the post co-authored by his Web Foundation co-founder Rosemary Leith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QsNTyA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Far too many young people remain excluded and unable to use the web to share their talents and ideas.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHZAiw"&gt;“Far too many young people remain excluded and unable to use the web to share their talents and ideas,” the post states. And for every young person without internet access, there’s a “lost opportunity for new ideas and innovations that can serve humanity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UB9rRq"&gt;The breadth of the digital divide has come into sharp focus during the coronavirus pandemic, as people tried to work and learn from home, often on less-than-ideal internet connections. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, in the US alone, only two-thirds of people living in rural areas have broadband access, compared to 79 percent of people living in suburbs. And the Federal Communications Commission’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;universally disliked broadband maps&lt;/a&gt; don’t give a totally clear picture of the state of broadband access in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTYeSl"&gt;Berners-Lee and Leith write that worldwide, the problem is similarly bad. “Only the top third of under-25s have a home internet connection, according to UNICEF, leaving 2.2 billion young people without the stable access they need to learn online, which has helped so many others continue their education during the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hQa8F"&gt;Berners-Lee and Leith also cite the need to protect young people online from abuse and misinformation, “which threatens their participation and can force them from platforms altogether,” they write. “This is especially true for those disproportionately targeted on the basis of their race, religion, sexuality, abilities, and gender.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wp6Vnj"&gt;The pair call for access to the internet to be recognized as a basic right, and they say the costs of making sure every young person is connected “is well within our reach. Through funding for network infrastructure, subsidies, and support for community networks, we can get the web into the hands of every young person on earth.” “An all-out push to connect the world will make sure that young people do not fall through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SQU0Lf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Berners-Lee says internet access should be treated as a basic right&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YhTg0y"&gt;Berners-Lee and Leith say that the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), an initiative of the Web Foundation, “has calculated that $428 billion of additional investment over ten years would provide everyone a quality broadband connection. To put this in perspective, that amounts to the equivalent of just $116 per person for the 3.7 billion people who remain offline today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tt9JSI"&gt;Providing universal broadband access within the next ten years “would deliver around $8.7 trillion in direct economic benefits,” they write, &lt;a href="https://institute.global/policy/progressive-case-universal-internet-access-how-close-digital-divide-2030"&gt;citing a new analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. “We can’t afford not to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXdPzx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
