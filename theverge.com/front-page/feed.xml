    <title>Coinbase is adding a way to showcase NFTs later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNSQn3lpdKtcPuwGdf3b_FFvnDI=/25x0:675x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986646/0_fwgVMwxTtDBDuIue.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Coinbase&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KU8SrC"&gt;Coinbase &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72"&gt;announced Monday that it plans to sell, trade, and mint NFTs&lt;/a&gt; in an expansion from the marketplace’s cryptocurrency-based roots. Details on how “Coinbase NFT” will do all of that are slim, but the company sees an opportunity. “Just as Coinbase helped millions of people access bitcoin for the first time in an easy and trusted way — we want to do the same for the NFTs,” Coinbase vice president of product Sanchan Saxena writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KetjVa"&gt;The big idea seems to be social engagement. Coinbase wants to “curate your personal feed” of NFTs and display the NFTs you own on your profile so you can make connections with like-minded fans of digital cats, punks, apes, and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rxPwu8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="llBuHk"&gt;At launch, Coinbase NFT “will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards,” all NFTs will be on-chain, and there are plans for multi-chain support “soon after” launch. Besides whatever curated feed the company plans to introduce, Coinbase NFT seems similar what competitor OpenSea offers as the current NFT marketplace du jour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9jUpK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, what seems to be missing from Coinbase’s plans is any kind of Layer-2 scaling integration, the popular method for reducing the costs and environmental impact of minting and trading art on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are criticized for the way they replicate some of the inequitable and speculative parts of the real-world art market, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;they also carry plenty of environmental concerns&lt;/a&gt; because of how much energy is required to run the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWGJ8C"&gt;Coinbase’s plans are early and could possibly change, but if another NFT showroom/trading floor sparks your curiosity, the company already has &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce"&gt;a waitlist for early access&lt;/a&gt; you can join.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charter asks ex-customers to resubscribe or risk their credit scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NlssuVWZAd7qHeSfEhNDqXtX9aE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986448/acastro_170712_1847_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;Charter has been telling former customers that it’ll forgive their debts and stop reporting them to credit agencies if they resubscribe to the company’s Spectrum TV, internet, or voice service, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-10-12/column-spectrum-billing-threat"&gt;according to a story from the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The “one-time courtesy” offer came to light after Steve Schklair, who says he hasn’t been a Spectrum customer for years and doesn’t owe the company money, shared a letter describing the supposed deal with the&lt;em&gt; LA Times. &lt;/em&gt;Charter later confirmed the letter was authentic, saying that it was an offer that was meant to help consumers “reconnect” to Spectrum, as well as get a leg up on their finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV7ToN"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;, the letter Charter sent Schklair said the company would cancel his (supposed) debts after he resubscribed and that his new account would be in good standing. It seemingly implied that Charter had been reporting that debt to credit reporting agencies (potentially bringing down Schklair’s credit score) and that he would no longer have to worry about that if he was a customer again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jzkeDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reporting debts is Charter’s legal right — but Schklair says the offer still feels like blackmail&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhKUtr"&gt;The letter tries to paint it as a charitable offer from the ISP, saying that a good credit history helps you get credit cards and better mortgage rates. While the company has a history of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/29/21157801/stop-spectrum-junk-mail-how-to-spam-calls-online-form"&gt;sending customers an annoying amount of letters&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; hilariously points out that this one comes off as “Sopranos-like,” almost as if the company is saying, “You’ve made a nice life for yourself. Be a shame if something happened to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03FxJH"&gt;Charter has a legal right to report an ex-customer’s debts to credit report agencies if they still owe money — that’s how the credit reporting system works, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421193/credit-reporting-infrastructure-errors-experian-equifax-transunion"&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;. But if the letter was offering no-strings-attached debt forgiveness, or even a reasonable debt repayment plan, it probably wouldn’t be described as “sleazy” and “corporate blackmail,” “filled with real and implied threats” by some of the people receiving it. It’s hard to come off as altruistic if you’re not telling people about the better options they have and just trying to get them to give you their money again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jn6au7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spectrum customer service reps couldn’t find outstanding payments for Schklair’s account&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9ykb"&gt;Making the situation feel even grosser, Charter may have sent the debt forgiveness offer to Schklair for no reason — he told the&lt;em&gt; LA Times &lt;/em&gt;that Charter hasn’t been dinging his credit reports, the company hadn’t been contacting him about missed payments, and that two customer service reps said he didn’t owe anything (Charter said it wouldn’t discuss Schklair’s individual case for privacy reasons). In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Charter said the letter was a “highly targeted promotional offer for former customers who have an outstanding past-due balance of at least two years, and are currently in the collections process” and that the offer made it so customers would be able to escape collections without paying that balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8nGKw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, a competitor to Charter, is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRFxry"&gt;I’m not a financial advisor, but I’ve heard most of the experts say that you should be wary of offers from companies saying you can consume your way to financial freedom. The offer in the letter reported by the&lt;em&gt; LA Times&lt;/em&gt; goes from $50 to $75 after a year — a big jump that someone who struggled with payments in the past may have a hard time dealing with (unless they’re counting on Spectrum to lock them into a cycle of debt forgiveness offers). While trying to woo customers back is standard corporate stuff, maybe Charter should consider either going back to the standard “we miss you” letters or making actually helpful offers to customers rather than a way to trap them back in the same debt cycle (provided, of course, that the customer was even in debt in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vudu brings its TV and movie streaming app to Facebook’s Oculus VR devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKUhQBU02LA92TvQhDfC-KpklI8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986282/Vudu_Debuts_on_Oculus_with_Free_Guy_Rental.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vudu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P1khS8"&gt;Vudu’s freemium streaming app is now supported on Facebook’s Oculus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;Quest 1 and Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; VR devices, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; more than a hundred 3D titles are available to buy or rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKN1LQ"&gt;The Fandango-owned streaming service — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228486/fandango-vudu-streaming-purchase-walmart-comcast-nbcuniversal-amazon-itunes"&gt;was purchased&lt;/a&gt; from Walmart last year — supports both free, ad-supported movies and TV, as well as rentals and purchases. In addition to the 100-plus titles available on Vudu in 3D, the service additionally offers more than 200,000 titles to rent or buy to stream on other devices, as well as thousands of ad-supported titles. It’s the first time that the app is supported on VR devices, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUZ17Q"&gt;“We’re thrilled to be working with Oculus to help transport fans to new worlds in the most immersive formats available,” Fandango’s chief commercial officer Kevin Shepela said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G81nLG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service offers more than 100 titles in 3D&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3Vwuc"&gt;A Fandango spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment about whether it planned to expand to other VR devices as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRf7zA"&gt;Following its acquisition of Vudu last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607391/vudu-fandango-now-combining-roku-movies-tv"&gt;Fandango pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on its FandangoNow streaming service — indicating it felt that Vudu was the clear way forward in the streaming space. In addition to its rentals, Vudu emphasizes the large number of 4K UHD titles it can stream, far more than many rivals (though support for UHD streaming on most major services has expanded significantly in the last couple of years). Per the Vudu spokesperson, films available to rent in 3D on Oculus include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v30fH8"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HMCy61"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Meg&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0T8zVJ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Live Die Repeat&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1vF5Bt"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rampage&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dObMx7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hMnKDs"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hh9uga"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon 2 &lt;/em&gt;($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7hEHKS"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRxq4v"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Saw: The Final Chapter &lt;/em&gt;($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Swuscu"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Minions&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ae1gIw"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Everest&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aangjU"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Retribution&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lGPsiQ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;X-Men: Days of Future Past&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m1OOOe"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Transformers: The Last Knigh&lt;/em&gt;t ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Okrw8"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sT1eU1"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Walk&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IUtJAl"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Boss Baby: Family Business&lt;/em&gt; ($5.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pPuuYo"&gt;The service also allows 3D movie and TV purchases and 2D/3D bundles. &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt; are available to buy in 3D for $14.99 and $19.99, respectively. &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; bundles can be purchased for $24.99 and $34.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA authorizes first e-cigarette but only allows tobacco flavors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJvNHkqsVLWlXJRp1XVw3gjYSm8=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986176/vaping.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kztesM"&gt;After rejecting over one million e-cigarette related products, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-e-cigarette-products-marking-first-authorization-its-kind-agency?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it authorized its first e-cigarette: the Vuse Solo, made by R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company. The agency is allowing the company’s tobacco-flavored e-liquid pods on the market but rejected its flavored pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxavAo"&gt;It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665333/fda-vaping-flavors-authorization-juul"&gt;over a month&lt;/a&gt; since the FDA’s deadline for its review of vapes and e-cigarettes. Early September marked the end of a yearlong period where companies were allowed to keep selling their products, even though agency regulations said that any new tobacco products need authorization before they can be marketed. Now, anything sold&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;without authorization is being marketed illegally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KccU8z"&gt;Companies submitted applications for 6.5 million vaping and e-cigarette products, and the agency has rejected or said the applications were incomplete for the vast majority. The FDA says its decisions center on whether the benefits of an e-cigarette product to adult smokers — who may use it to quit smoking — outweigh the risk of hooking kids and teenagers on nicotine for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3hPO2"&gt;The tobacco-flavored Vuse e-cigarettes are the first that the FDA says meet that bar. Around 10 percent of high school students who vape use Vuse products, according to the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey. But teens are less likely to use tobacco flavors, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-e-cigarette-products-marking-first-authorization-its-kind-agency?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA rejected 10 of Vuse’s flavored e-liquid pods and is still reviewing its application for a menthol flavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRI9Pl"&gt;The agency said in its statement that it’s also restricting R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company’s advertising around its e-cigarettes to make it less likely teens will see the ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVtyPX"&gt;The FDA still hasn’t ruled on 2 percent of the submitted vaping and e-cigarette applications. That includes applications from Juul, a market leader and the company that’s been most heavily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928616/juul-ecig-vaping-fda-raid-inspection-smoking-nicotine"&gt;criticized and blamed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850376/juul-ecigs-vaping-fda-smoking-nicotine-health-science"&gt;attracting kids&lt;/a&gt; and teenagers to vaping. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly can’t get enough chips for the iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UIk7a3dRnllE-5WPncwjzWcYPYc=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986132/vpavic_210916_4760_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfElgh"&gt;The chip shortage is hitting the iPhone 13, with Apple reportedly unable to get enough parts to hit its planned manufacturing goals, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-aapl-to-cut-iphone-production-targets-due-to-chip-shortage?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had originally planned to produce 90 million iPhones in the final months of 2021, but it’s reportedly slashing that number by 10 million (or around 11 percent) due to supply issues with chips from Broadcom and Texas Instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy8ePE"&gt;While the primary A15 Bionic SoC on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro is manufactured by TSMC, there are plenty of other chip-based components inside the phone that come from other sources. As iFixit’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F12%2F22723209%2Fapple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thorough teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro’s logic board&lt;/a&gt; shows, Texas Instruments and Broadcom are responsible for several key components, including chips that handle display power management, Face ID’s laser array, USB connectivity, wireless power, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yaz8Ky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6KZnLs"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;already warned&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tesla-to-take-hit-from-chip-shortage-a-sign-of-problems-intensity-11627474416"&gt;company’s Q3 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that it might see chip supply issues, noting that “we’ll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we’re dealt.” But it seems that even with Apple’s best efforts and favorable relationships with suppliers, it just can’t get the physical components together that it needs to make enough iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19nqBT"&gt;It’s likely that Apple will eventually manage to get production up, but the slashed manufacturing estimate means that it’ll probably be even more difficult to find an (already tough to get ahold of) iPhone 13 in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YmjrpX"&gt;On Tuesdays for the remainder of the year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be featuring additional new episodes, with each focused on a specific topic usually discussed on our regular Friday shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWSbB6"&gt;Today, we start our run with a discussion on the reviews we haven’t talked too much about yet on the show: this year’s software and hardware endeavors from Microsoft. In this episode, Dieter hosts a roundtable on reviews for the Microsoft products launched this fall:  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22713963/microsoft-surface-go-3-review"&gt;Surface Go 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJHY7C"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5923826643&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1zTsPD"&gt;Dieter is joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewers Tom Warren, Monica Chin, and Dan Seifert, who have all reviewed the products, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONmJfV"&gt;The show answers questions like: Why does Windows 11 feel unfinished? How do the new Surface products fit in with a new operating system? How flexible of a machine (in both power capability and mode switching) are the new Surfaces for the thin and light class of devices? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuYAoA"&gt;You can listen to the full discussion here or on your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has banned nearly 1,000 ‘militarized social movements,’ documents reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-RACISM-PROTEST-UNREST" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1U45EKUm8pqhnERNMgY_0IwgD6I=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985642/1227795113.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JEFF DEAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="68Retr"&gt;Facebook has placed at least 986 groups on a private list of banned “militarized social movements,” according to internal Facebook documents &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/12/facebook-secret-blacklist-dangerous/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The documents hint at the scale of militia organizing on Facebook — something the company cracked down on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-hit-facebook-crack-down-n1237330"&gt;in August of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqKvKW"&gt;Militarized social movements are one part of Facebook’s larger “dangerous individuals and organizations” list, which &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21083395-dio-2"&gt;published a snapshot of&lt;/a&gt; in its entirety. The term refers to armed groups that promote armed conflict, as well as groups that support violence or looting at protests; in practice, it’s apparently composed largely of right-wing militias with some left-wing, anarchist, or generally anti-government organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7rnIdU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an adversarial space”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpENEg"&gt;Facebook’s “dangerous individuals” list also includes white supremacist bands, hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, and branches of Al Qaeda and other global terrorist organizations. All are banned from maintaining pages, groups, or profiles on the service. Beyond that, the categories are sorted into tiers. Tier 1 includes hate and terror groups, and Facebook users can’t express praise or support for them in any form. Tier 2 includes “violent non-state actors” like armed rebels that can only be praised for nonviolent activities. Militarized social movements are designated as Tier 3, which don’t have comparable restrictions on how users discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qad9Nk"&gt;Facebook noted in October of 2020 that it had identified 600 militarized social movements and removed around 2,400 pages and 14,200 groups maintained by them. The company also said it had removed 1,700 pages and 5,600 groups associated with QAnon — which is designated a militarized social movement but is not an organized group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBDZ0u"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; notes, the group designations can be fuzzy. One subset of the violent boogaloo movement, for instance, is classified as a Tier 1 terrorist organization, while the larger movement is a militarized social movement. The designation also includes news outlets like the anarchist site &lt;em&gt;It’s Going Down — &lt;/em&gt;which could theoretically have been grouped under the umbrella of “supporting violent acts amid protests” but is listed as an “armed militia group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVNb3g"&gt;Facebook has been criticized for both overly lax and overly punitive enforcement. But most recently, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;come under general scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; for not releasing details about its operations to outside researchers or policymakers, something that makes it more difficult to evaluate its moderation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIGnEj"&gt;In statements to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook said it had not previously released the list because publishing too many details might compromise the effectiveness of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nyh2r2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First, Facebook does not want violence organized or facilitated on its platform and the DOI list is an effort to keep highly risky groups from doing that. It’s not perfect, but that’s why it exists. 2/n&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Fishman (@brianfishman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brianfishman/status/1448034756021547009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y1B69G"&gt;“This is an adversarial space, so we try to be as transparent as possible while also prioritizing security, limiting legal risks, and preventing opportunities for groups to get around our rules,” said counterterrorism and dangerous organizations policy director Brian Fishman. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brianfishman/status/1448034573388943361"&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, Fishman added that the leaked list was “not comprehensive” and was being constantly updated. “Facebook does not want violence organized or facilitated on its platform and the [dangerous individuals and organizations] list is an effort to keep highly risky groups from doing that. It’s not perfect, but that’s why it exists,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brianfishman/status/1448034756021547009"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEECGT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added tweet thread from Brian Fishman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password will now let you share passwords with just a link</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpHSsh9VlHePXfkCp9tDACDZT0Y=/644x265:2162x1277/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985638/Itemsharingdetails.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 1Password&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="loRurv"&gt;Password manager 1Password is making it easier to share passwords with anyone, with Psst! (password secure sharing tool), &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/psst-item-sharing/"&gt;a new link sharing feature&lt;/a&gt; the company is releasing today. Instead of using 1Password’s pre-existing sharing options, which require an account, or just copying and pasting log-in information, which is inherently insecure, Psst! makes sharing a password a bit more like sharing a Google Doc with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPzf36"&gt;You can create a link to share password credentials, set when it expires (when the first person views it, or at one hour, one day, one week, 14 days, or 30 days), and share the password with specific people (via their emails) or for anyone with the link. The whole process is a lot like sharing a link to a Google Drive folder or a Google Doc. You can get an idea of how the whole thing works by watching the video 1Password created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="roK1ij"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgcDdxvyJPE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj5Cne"&gt;The experience for someone receiving a link can vary depending on the share settings. If you set what you’re sharing to be viewable by anyone, the link will just open up into a copy of the credentials at the time they were shared. If what you shared is only meant for a specific set of people, they have to confirm their email and then receive a one-time verification code to enter and receive access. It’s worth noting that the link only allows access to a copy of the information shared when you created the link. If you change the password stored in your vault later, old links won’t display the new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WErUjJ"&gt;The added security Psst! brings is partially dependent on the security of the email receiving those verification codes (one can imagine a scenario the receiver’s account has been compromised), but this method keeps the rest of your vault’s information secure, provides a way to track who accessed the login, and access to the login expires whenever you decide it should. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter testing an easier way to switch to your reverse-chronological feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZagSMEdC8_OrY6NwUQPr2ekqPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985496/akrales_180620_1777_0266.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvoE7v"&gt;Twitter is testing a new way to switch to your reverse-chronological feed a bit more easily, the company announced Tuesday. Right now, when you tap the three-star icon at the top of your feed to switch between the Home feed (which sorts tweets for you) or the Latest feed (which shows them in reverse chronological order), a small menu shows up that prompts you to switch to whichever feed you’re not on. For some users on iOS, though, when you tap the three-star icon, Twitter is testing new Home or Latest tabs at the top of your screen instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rwzB4"&gt;Here’s what the change will look like, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1447971179185295364"&gt;according to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve pinned lists, the tabs should look familiar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VXByQf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Top Tweets first or latest Tweets first? We’re making it easier to switch between the two timelines and know which one you’re scrolling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now testing with some of you on iOS: swipe between "Home" and "Latest" on the Home tab to choose which Tweets you see first. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LoyAN4cONu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LoyAN4cONu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1447971179185295364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce07w2"&gt;This change does feel like it will be an improvement since it will mean fewer taps to switch between feeds and make it easier to know at a glance which feed you’re looking at. That said, it’s unclear if Twitter plans to roll this test out more broadly and, if so, when that might happen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic finally admits that its Imposters mode was ‘inspired’ by Among Us </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ynDwItsRD5dFOjFZKskbIeMWJJM=/249x0:2112x1242/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985242/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_9.21.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hEQsAZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Imposter mode&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; clone in all but name, but nearly two months later, Epic Games is finally acknowledging in &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v18-20-update-combat-assault-rifle-vs-combat-smg"&gt;today’s patch notes&lt;/a&gt; what was clear from the start: Imposters was “inspired by &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; from Innersloth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlXtIz"&gt;Imposters launched in August, set in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s canon and 3D worlds but borrowing heavily from &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ gameplay, mechanics, and even terminology (like the “Imposters” name itself). At the time, Epic didn’t credit &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; or Innersloth, leading members of Innersloth’s team to complain about having their work copied without credit or the chance to collaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xthuap"&gt;As Innersloth co-founder Marcus Bromander noted at the time, the company didn’t patent the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; mechanics, but he lamented Epic’s lack of effort in developing its own more unique take on the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xyzuum"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We didn't patent the Among Us mechanics. I don't think that leads to a healthy game industry. Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?&lt;/p&gt;— Puff (@PuffballsUnited) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PuffballsUnited/status/1427781760692068355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
