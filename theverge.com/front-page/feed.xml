    <title>Can Apple get you to pay for podcasts?</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The world’s most popular podcast app gets subscriptions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CyXaHi"&gt;Beth Silvers credits paid subscriptions for making podcasting her full-time job. She and Sarah Stewart Holland host &lt;a href="https://www.pantsuitpoliticsshow.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show that tries to turn political punditry into “grace-filled conversations.” The two of them launched the show in 2015 and then started experimenting with subscriptions two years later, first on their own website in the form of monthly contributions, and then, not long after, on Patreon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpYz2O"&gt;Three years later, they now have over 4,000 monthly subscribers who pay anywhere from $5 to $100 per month, employ a full-time listener-turned-employee, and fully focus their time on the show. Their revenue is now equally made up of advertising and memberships. “It was still a big risk [when we switched to Patreon],” Silvers says. “We weren’t quite at a sustainable point. We thought to get to sustainability, we’ve got to invest more time here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JWBcU"&gt;Now, the women are trying something new: Apple Podcasts subscriptions. They’re among the first creators who’ve signed up to try the service, which allows podcasters to offer paid subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;from within the Podcasts app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNCclH"&gt;The most popular podcasting app putting its weight behind subscriptions could be monumental. Apple has the chance to popularize paid subscriptions by making it easy to listen and subscribe in one place, and it could influence the industry to shift slightly away from its dependence on advertising at the same time. Plus, unlike other solutions, Apple will also allow listeners to try these subscriptions for free for a limited amount of time, giving people a chance to preview what they’re paying to access. Apple’s not precious about the content podcasters offer there, either. Shows and bonus content don’t have to be exclusive to the platform, and they can mix free and paid content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRuoiNM2PxuTr4bDIIlEr1U9X7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462736/download.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Podcasts’ subscription product will let creators decide how much to charge for content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEODu"&gt;“When Apple does [subscriptions], it’s like flicking a switch,” says Jacob Weisberg, CEO of podcasting network Pushkin Industries, which author Malcolm Gladwell co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47ZJC9"&gt;Even David Stern, the CEO of Supporting Cast, which runs a competing podcast subscription platform, sees Apple’s entrance as a turning point for the industry. “The number one challenge we have in getting podcasters to consider working with Supporting Cast is simply that people aren’t used to the idea of a paid podcast,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.supportingcast.fm/post/what-apple-podcast-subscriptions-means-for-supporting-cast-slate-and-our-podcasters-2"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. “Apple’s push into premium content will help the industry understand how much revenue they are leaving on the table by not giving their listeners something to pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0kGta"&gt;The potential upside for podcasters is huge. Apple Podcasts is the biggest podcast listening platform in the world, and listeners won’t have to leave the app to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6d4Qq"&gt;But the service does come with trade-offs. Most crucially, podcasters have to pay a flat fee of $19.99 per year to even offer subscriptions, and they then give Apple a 30 percent cut of revenue for each subscriber’s first year and 15 percent for the years following. Patreon, in contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;takes up to&lt;/a&gt; 12 percent of creators’ revenue. Apple Podcasts is also only available on iOS devices, which most of the world doesn’t use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tArcOr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could make paying for podcasts mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5rI0H"&gt;Those may be tough terms for podcasters, but it might pay off. Apple Podcasts’ marketing potential is massive, and it should make it far easier for hosts to promote a subscription. Right now, podcasters who offer exclusive or bonus content often do so through private RSS feeds, which require listeners to input a link into the listening app of their choice — a feature that some apps, like Spotify, don’t support. Podcasters might have to walk them through this process, and if someone cancels their membership, it generally falls on the podcaster to make sure their RSS link access is revoked. Getting listeners to pay also usually involves convincing them to sign up for another platform, like Patreon, a far bigger hurdle than tapping a button inside the app they’re already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu2p8h"&gt;This is why the &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt; team signed up for Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions, especially considering a majority of their listeners are on Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcQd85"&gt;“We like giving our listeners options, and we feel like there are people who probably would like our bonus content who just don’t want to deal with the hassle of figuring Patreon out,” Silvers says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNr0N0"&gt;But they’re going to have to get creative with how they advertise their perks. Patreon is more fully built out to support creators who want various benefits. In &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;’ case, subscribers not only receive bonus content, but also a community on Patreon itself where they can chat about episodes and participate in a book club where Silvers and Stewart Holland ship the books they plan to discuss. Silvers and Stewart Holland also receive their listeners’ personal information, like addresses, which help them decide where to tour. Their listeners’ emails, which they also receive, allow them to send FYIs about ticket sales or other content, like YouTube Lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nJQ1hW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hurdle of signing up for an extra service might be too much for some listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3uuGmR"&gt;“We all just love convenience, like we love our stuff to just be in one place,” says Jessica Cordova Kramer, the CEO of Lemonada Media, which plans to use Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions in addition to existing subscription services. “And yes, there’s an extra hoop to jump through if you’re using something that’s outside the listening ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH5GaL"&gt;Apple doesn’t yet seem interested in building the social aspect of podcasting communities, so if podcasters want to advertise their Discord or Patreon, they’ll have to shout out those perks and ask listeners to contact them for access — another hurdle. Apple also won’t give podcasters their listeners’ emails, names, phone numbers, addresses, or any personal information, so Apple ends up mediating all interactions and keeping the data. Apple does say it’ll give podcasters aggregated, anonymized analytics about their listeners, like where they’re based, but these tools likely won’t wholly replace the benefits of having subscribers’ emails or names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elvcpq"&gt;“Having the Discord in our community has been so rewarding to us, the hosts, and the people that have joined it. Without being able to foster that ... is almost like a blocker for the Apple subscriptions,” says Matt Kolowski, a host of a show about movies called &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/70mm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;70mm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has around 140 subscribers on Patreon. “I’d really love for them to realize that a sense of community is such a huge part of creating a fun podcast experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubPsqH"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about Apple’s push into subscriptions, Patreon’s chief revenue officer Kerri Pollard specifically called out its community features as a selling point. “We know creators see the value in our offering that serves them and their communities first, and will continue to use Patreon,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDf8jm"&gt;Community has become so important, in fact, that even Facebook justified &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;its push&lt;/a&gt; into audio and podcasting this week because of it. The company says 170 million people on Facebook are connected to a page that’s linked to a specific podcast, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="41LJxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some podcasters say, more than anything else, their subscribers value community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nFoA8h"&gt;Another factor for podcasters to consider: more platforms means more administrative work. RSS promised one feed for all the apps, but the ecosystem of subscriptions isn’t shaping up that way. Kolowski and his co-hosts upload bonus and early access content to Patreon; their usual shows to their hosting provider, Anchor; and if they participate in Apple Podcasts, they’d need to separately post uploads there, too. If Spotify gets into the subscription game, they might have to manually upload content there as well — although being on Anchor, a Spotify company, might pay off in that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsMQg"&gt;“Ultimately, I don’t really want like four places to upload a podcast to because selfishly, I don’t want to have that kind of legwork,” Kolowski says, adding that most of his show’s listeners are on Pocket Casts, not Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Xli1"&gt;But for larger networks, Apple Podcasts’ subscriptions might be the right fit at the right time. Pushkin Industries &lt;a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/news/announcing-pushnik-premium-subscription-program/"&gt;is launching&lt;/a&gt; its first subscription program, PushNik, through Apple Podcasts, with plans to eventually make the bonus and exclusive content available on other apps. Pushkin CEO Weisberg helped &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launch Slate Plus, a subscription program that includes ad-free podcasts, years ago, and says, at the time, there were no easy solutions for publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCgfDG"&gt;“It was so clunky to get the private RSS feed into whatever player you use,” he says. “It’s just a lot of steps, and to me it was really difficult, and the thing that I was always banging on about at Slate was we’ve got to reduce the number of clicks to get the bonus content for subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUlcSH"&gt;Apple’s subscriptions solve that. Of course, in the years since &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched Slate Plus, Patreon has sprung up, as have other companies like Supporting Cast, which &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; launched to help other podcasters set up memberships. They don’t solve the one-click problem, but they at least provide the infrastructure and tech support to keep a subscription business running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GkvBfu"&gt;For these networks, a 30 percent initial cut that eventually goes to 15 percent might be worth it. Extra money is extra money. But for the smaller podcasters who’ve focused on community and creating a fan base of engaged listeners, Apple might not provide enough — especially if a show reaches a global audience that’s more Android-based than iOS. But it seems almost certain that with Apple supporting and caring about subscriptions, more people than ever before will be paying for shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s leaked tracking tag has UWB and USB-C charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nWIO0bJ9_UhBom5LNcScHZKRTT8=/220x0:1462x828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170769/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_1.45.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oppo-smart-tag-uwb-support-leak/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; / Digital Chat Station (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/KbWp4iUK7?ssl_rnd=1619068976.2363&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1619068991991" target="_blank"&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oPjsBm"&gt;It looks like Oppo will be the next company to throw its hat in the Bluetooth tracking tag game, with a leak of the company’s new Smart Tag &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oppo-smart-tag-uwb-support-leak/"&gt;appearing over on &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(via Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX2vB5"&gt;Oppo’s tracker looks to distinguish itself in at least one key way from other major tracking tags by offering a USB-C port for recharging the tags, instead of requiring replaceable coin cell batteries (or even worse, nonremovable batteries, as is the case on some Tile trackers). That should make the new Oppo tags a bit more environmentally friendly, although it’s unclear what the impact on battery life will be compared to a more traditional battery system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pHDb7x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pFJ0tI"&gt;And while details are slim on the Oppo Smart Tag, the leak does confirm that the tracker will support ultra-wideband radio for more precise tracking, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s recently revealed AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung’s SmartTag Plus (which was released earlier in April). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSzq1c"&gt;Of course, a Bluetooth tracker is only as good as the network of devices that can support it.  Tile, the longtime leader in the tracking tag space, has spent almost a decade building up its network of tags, and Apple’s Find My network is able to leverage the hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads in the world to track down AirTags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twmgwz"&gt;With 9 percent of the global market share at the end of 2020 (according to &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/em&gt;’s data&lt;/a&gt;), Oppo can likely make a good case that it has the market saturation to make its tags effective, too, but it’ll likely heavily depend on where users are in the world and how popular Oppo’s phones are in that area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWUQrW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is being scrutinized by Senate Democrats for Autopilot misuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leY7fEzJrjurdkGKjqEw-mOkZGg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170648/jbareham_180213_2301_0149.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r4SucX"&gt;Two Senate Democrats are urging federal regulators to take “corrective actions” against Tesla to prevent further misuse of the company’s advanced driver assist feature. The request comes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;the aftermath of a fatal crash&lt;/a&gt; in which two men from Texas were killed after their Tesla Model S crashed with no one in the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FALgL"&gt;In a letter sent to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Acting Administrator Steven Cliff, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) implored the agency to determine the exact cause of this recent crash to “better inform” future legislation around advanced driver assist systems like Tesla’s Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1ub8X0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We strongly urge you to conduct a complete investigation into Saturday’s fatal Tesla vehicle crash”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xir4pc"&gt;“We strongly urge you to conduct a complete investigation into Saturday’s fatal Tesla vehicle crash and develop recommendations for improving automated driving and driver assistance systems,” Markey and Blumenthal write. “We look forward to working with you and the NTSB to implement policy changes that stop these preventable deaths from occurring and save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GnYmWE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;A special crash team from NHTSA is investigating the crash&lt;/a&gt;, as well as investigators from the independent National Transportation Safety Board. On Monday, NHTSA said the agency is coordinating with local law enforcement to learn more about the incident and will “take appropriate steps” when investigators have gathered more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZ6ROo"&gt;The incident took place at 9PM local time in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators are “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/business/tesla-fatal-crash-texas.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I5GlYb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear what direction NHTSA’s investigation will take&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6R0v9T"&gt;It’s not clear what direction NHTSA’s investigation will take. In the past, the agency has been &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/26455/nhtsas-flawed-autopilot-safety-study-unmasked"&gt;criticized for misrepresenting Autopilot’s safety record&lt;/a&gt; and for giving the company a pass when it comes to the possibility that its customers could misuse the technology in its vehicles. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;NHTSA recently disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active. Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1384580105649885188"&gt;recently tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that “NHTSA is great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xp0I29"&gt;NTSB, on the other hand, has proven more willing to point fingers at Musk’s company. An NTSB investigation into the 2018 death of a Tesla owner in California said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;Autopilot was partly to blame&lt;/a&gt;. Musk has been much more hostile toward the agency, at one point &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/elon-musk-hung-up-on-ntsb-chief-during-call-about-tesla-crash-probe/"&gt;hanging up on the chairman of NTSB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7IjCS"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1384254194975010826?s=21"&gt;In a recent tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” indicate that Autopilot was not engaged, nor had the vehicle owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eK7MJM"&gt;Tesla owners have shown that Autopilot can be used on roads without lane markings, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; recently conducted a test&lt;/a&gt; proving that Tesla’s vehicles can easily be tricked into thinking there is someone behind the wheel, even when there’s not. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube now lets creators change their channel name without changing their entire Google account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRMqa77Mk-u6ZQoEERgvJ6UEpTg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170536/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlkAzz"&gt;YouTube is making it easier for creators to change the name and profile picture on their channels. Creators will now be able to update their channel name and picture inside YouTube, and those changes will &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;impact their profile on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdT8R5"&gt;Until now, creators had to change their name and icon for their entire Google account — so their name on YouTube would be the same name they send emails from in Gmail. That didn’t necessarily make sense from a branding or professional perspective, and the new system should offer a bit more flexibility for creators who might prefer to send emails under their actual name instead of their channel name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etuLfw"&gt;There is one substantial caveat to the new feature, though: creators with a verification badge will lose their check mark if they change their name. YouTube says creators will have to apply to receive the badge again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJnJA4"&gt;Both personal and brand accounts will be able to use the new channel name-changing feature. YouTube says the feature is a “top request from creators” and that it’ll be rolling out starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcbW7F"&gt;On the desktop, you can change a channel name and picture by going to &lt;a href="https://studio.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube Studio&lt;/a&gt; and then Customization, where they’re located under the Basic Info and Branding tabs. On mobile, you need to tap your profile picture, then your channel, and then hit “Edit channel.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden is betting big on small networks to close the digital divide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gg5HkHsdhe6jbLjADAQOkpxRUM0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170496/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xz3XDe"&gt;Like hundreds of school districts across the country, Edgecombe County Public Schools in North Carolina had to move their coursework online to keep their students safe during the coronavirus pandemic. Worksheets became websites and school assemblies became Zoom conferences with outside speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jGJSL"&gt;But for students without a stable internet connection, teachers had to hand-deliver packets of homework that would normally have been put online. In assemblies, students are asked to turn off their cameras so their streams don’t cut out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3bK9GN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We tell the kids, it’s not your fault”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1bEkhj"&gt;“We just let the speakers know, our students are probably not going to be on camera. And it’s because we don’t have good internet speeds out here,” Arlane Gordon-Bray, community and industry engagement partner for Edgecombe County Public Schools iZone program, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And we tell the kids, it’s not your fault that you’re not able to fully participate in what we consider the norm of internet etiquette.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="41Wd3d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr6yFf"&gt;Throughout our discussion Friday, Gordon-Bray’s cell signal cut out three times, disconnecting our call. She had to call back on a landline phone at the school so we could finish the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6g7XX7"&gt;In theory, help is on the way. The Biden administration’s ambitious infrastructure proposal, the American Jobs Plan, includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;$100 billion in broadband funding&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of connecting every American to high-speed broadband by the end of the decade. But with Senate Republicans set to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/infrastructure-plan-republican-senate-counteroffer/"&gt;dramatically cut&lt;/a&gt; total investment in their counter-proposal, the future of the package is unclear. Making Biden’s plan work will mean wading into a mess of local rules around municipal broadband and trying to undo decades of rules about how places like Edgecombe County can get online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcJhdP"&gt;Biden’s plan focuses on local and nonprofit telecoms, prioritizing publicly owned networks over giants like Verizon and Comcast that dominate better-served markets. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;the proposal&lt;/a&gt; distributed last month, the White House described the American Jobs Plan as “prioritiz[ing] support for broadband networks, owned, operated by, or affiliated with local governments, non-profits, and co-operatives” so that providers face “less pressure to turn profits.” As of January 2020, over 500 US communities are served by a publicly owned network, according to the &lt;a href="https://muninetworks.org/communitymap"&gt;Institute for Local Self-Reliance&lt;/a&gt;. But even as these networks grow and expand across the country, &lt;a href="https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks/"&gt;18 states restrict them&lt;/a&gt; in some form, whether that be banning them outright or outlawing their expansion into adjacent counties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fukYZn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Broadband for 100% of us. I'm all in.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1377282472422092803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6UaFU"&gt;Greenlight Community Broadband, located in Wilson, North Carolina, is one of those &lt;a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/transcript-community-broadband-bits-episode-430"&gt;municipally owned networks&lt;/a&gt;. Greenlight is the state’s first community-owned fiber network and has been in operation since 2008. But in 2011, the North Carolina legislature passed a law banning municipal telecoms. Wilson’s Greenlight was exempt from it, seeing as the company was already connecting people in the community. Still, it’s made it more difficult for the network to expand into adjacent communities, like those in Edgecombe County, that could benefit from the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUWbit"&gt;Removing these barriers is a key part of Biden’s plan. The proposal says that it would “promote price transparency and competition” among internet service providers by “lifting barriers that prevent” these networks from “competing on an even playing field with private providers” like AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon. This could mean preempting the laws in states like North Carolina that restrict the creation and expansion of publicly owned broadband networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMBXDa"&gt;“To say that communities can’t decide to take a vote, spend their own money, establish, or extend their own utilities based on what their residents want and what they need locally is ridiculous,” says Angelina Panettieri, legislative director of information technology and communications at the National League of Cities. “To tell people who are willing and able to invest the money in good fiber infrastructure for their residents that they can’t do it, but also that the incumbent ISPs will not provide it for them either? It’s just ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I6cIka"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just ridiculous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEHGTG"&gt;The infrastructure package’s final form is still up in the air. With Republicans introducing their own counter package Thursday, a lot could change before it lands on Biden’s desk. There’s the option for Democrats to move the package through reconciliation. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) would need to ensure nearly all Democrats were on board, otherwise a vote to approve the package could still fail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58UOfA"&gt;For Democrats, it won’t be easy to override these state bans, either. Republicans are already rallying to keep these kinds of preemption clauses out of the infrastructure package. In an op-ed &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/547073-barreling-towards-a-broadband-blunder"&gt;for &lt;em&gt;The Hill &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said, “[The package] bets on government-owned networks as the future of connectivity. Yet these projects routinely fail, leaving communities unconnected, promises broken, and taxpayers footing the bill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzd2XR"&gt;Still, the pushback hasn’t curbed Democratic efforts to include preemption in the final infrastructure package. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on April 16th, Rep Anna Eshoo (D-CA) said that she was working on including her bill, &lt;a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/eshoo-golden-booker-introduce-bill-expand-internet-access-and-protect-local"&gt;The Community Broadband Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced alongside Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), in the final package. Eshoo’s bill would remove state laws like North Carolina’s that restrict the creation and expansion of municipal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xh9Zp"&gt;“Am I hopeful? Yes,” Eshoo told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Am I working to get it into a large bill? Absolutely. Because this is a great opportunity for actual implementation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfLmsz"&gt;Booker also said that he was working to include the bill in Senate negotiations. “In this digital age, internet access is a necessity,” Booker said. “As the proposal moves through Congress, I will push for the inclusion of my bill which will help give cities the flexibility they need to meet the needs of their residents by removing onerous barriers to creating more municipal broadband networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1SheV"&gt;For now, Edgecombe County students will have to wait to see if private providers expand service in the area so maybe one day they’ll be able to ask a virtual assembly speaker a question with their webcams on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1yI0h"&gt;“We have to tell them, this is the way that the overall system has failed us,” Gordon-Bray says. “We are bearing the burden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYLD7g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1VCCg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s Hype House is getting its own Netflix reality show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1I4rumbYH27IakCorcwdKtUlRHw=/0x84:1370x997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170482/HH_GALLERY_Group8_Box_0372cr20210422_4863_j3g3bp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CARLOS GONZALEZ/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RhGSt"&gt;TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hype_House"&gt;Hype House&lt;/a&gt; is getting a Netflix reality show that will follow the lives of some of the biggest creators on the social media platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISvCtC"&gt;The new series is set to feature &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@k0uvr?"&gt;Kouvr Annon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nikitadragun?lang=en"&gt;Nikita Dragun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@siennamae?"&gt;Sienna Mae Gomez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lilhuddy?lang=en"&gt;Chase Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@larrayeeee?lang=en"&gt;Larri Merritt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@petroutv?lang=en"&gt;Thomas Petrou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexwaarren?lang=en"&gt;Alex Warren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jack.wright?lang=en"&gt;Jack Wright&lt;/a&gt; — collectively some of the largest creators on TikTok, each with millions of followers — and promises “the stories of the most popular personalities on social media as they come into their own, fall in love and tackle the next stage of their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9jno2"&gt;The Hype House was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/style/hype-house-los-angeles-tik-tok.html"&gt;founded in December 2019&lt;/a&gt; and is a content collective similar to David Dobrik’s Vlog Squad or Jake Paul’s Team 10 — but with a focus on TikTok creators and content instead of YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fdMe5"&gt;Notably absent from the Netflix series announcement, though, are some of the Hype House’s biggest early names, including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_D%27Amelio"&gt;Charli D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_D%27Amelio"&gt;Dixie D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Rae"&gt;Addison Rae&lt;/a&gt;, and Daisy Keech, former members of the group who have since parted ways for their own solo careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIJVQe"&gt;Netflix has yet to announce further details for the upcoming series, including a release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8A1nl"&gt;TikTok creators have increasingly looked to other platforms as a way to grow their audience and, critically, make money off their popularity. The D’Amelio family has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189180/charli-damelio-dixie-hulu-reality-series-documentary-tiktok-kardashians"&gt;forthcoming reality series on&lt;/a&gt; Hulu, and Rae has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332820/tiktok-deals-charli-dixie-damelio-morphe-addison-rae-spotify"&gt;a podcast with Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel is releasing a manga starring a cat — oh yeah, and a Deadpool one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1dulemNxL77Zsvs32PFv8y4B-tQ=/206x0:1661x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170368/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_10.43.04_AM.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Marvel Meow&lt;em&gt;, starring Chewie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Marvel and Viz Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XMi8UH"&gt;Marvel and manga publisher Viz Media &lt;a href="https://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/v/1006722"&gt;announced three Marvel-themed manga&lt;/a&gt; that will be released in English, and one of them features an adorable cat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga7Zrw"&gt;The first manga will be &lt;em&gt;Marvel Meow&lt;/em&gt;, starring Captain Marvel’s cat, Chewie. (If you follow Marvel’s Instagram account, you may have seen &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BurJLGVlh8-/"&gt;some comics&lt;/a&gt; starring the furry feline already.) Based on Viz Media’s description, it sounds like her primary goal is to annoy people in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which I approve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CGaQyF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BurJLGVlh8-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:16px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BurJLGVlh8-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" background:#FFFFFF; line-height:0; padding:0 0; text-align:center; text-decoration:none; width:100%;" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;div style=" display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; &lt;div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="DDuufT"&gt;Read the manga to find out how Chewie “wreaks havoc in the lives of Marvel’s most popular characters: Spider-Man and Iron Man, formidable villains Thanos and Galactus, and the whimsical antihero, Deadpool­ — all becoming the playthings of this capricious cat!” according to Viz Media’s description. Sounds like a good cat, tbh. &lt;em&gt;Marvel Meow&lt;/em&gt;, written and drawn by Nao Fuji, will be released on October 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEjEJi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadpool: Samurai &lt;/em&gt;will come out next, launching in February 2022. The manga was originally a one-shot in Japan, but it proved so popular that it was turned into a full series. It’s written by Sanshirou Kasama and drawn by Hikaru Uesugi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBYBjk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secret Reverse&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh!&lt;/em&gt; creator Kazuki Takahashi, is set for release in summer 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Fi is adding a less expensive unlimited plan with more limitations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZmf1FtrGnXCdqqTuV29BTLvd0w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69170096/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s MVNO wireless service adds another, more conventional plan option.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STPl05"&gt;Google Fi has announced a basic, less expensive unlimited plan called Simply Unlimited in addition to its current unlimited offering, now called Unlimited Plus. The new plan costs $60 per month for a single line and forgoes a couple of features available on the more expensive plan: international data and mobile tethering. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20869599/google-fi-launches-a-more-traditional-unlimited-plan"&gt;second time&lt;/a&gt; the MVNO has introduced a new unlimited plan, each marking a step toward a more conventional wireless plan pricing structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkjUS2"&gt;Simply Unlimited covers the expected basics of an unlimited cellular plan: unlimited data, calls, and texting in the US. While the newly dubbed Unlimited Plus (still $70 per month for one line) provides high-speed data and texting in over 200 countries for international travelers, Simply Unlimited only includes data and text in Canada and Mexico. The new plan doesn’t include hotspot tethering either, whereas Unlimited Plus includes high-speed tethering (subject to the plan’s 22GB overall limit on high-speed data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CCCtXg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="T6LFvG"&gt;Offering a cheaper plan without tethering tracks with other basic unlimited plans from the big wireless carriers; they tend to include slower tethering or none at all. Fi seems to be taking one more step toward conventional wireless offerings as an alternative to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782436/project-fi-data-only-sim-deal-wireless-lte-tmobile"&gt;the unorthodox Flexible plan&lt;/a&gt; it launched with six years ago — and which is still available today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 is CD Projekt Red’s biggest game ever, despite its disastrous launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/essEGtdiJZkkil_n0CSOCWCFvEI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169934/Cyberpunk2077_Im_your_fixer_RGB_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cj0Mq9"&gt;Despite &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s disastrous and bug-filled December 10th launch, the title was “the largest game in CD Projekt Red’s history,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/press-release-2020-results.pdf"&gt;the studio said on Thursday (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;. The game sold 13.7 million copies in 2020, according to CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAwH7a"&gt;We already had a pretty good idea that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has been a major financial success for the studio. On December 9th, one day before the game’s launch, CD Projekt Red announced that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; had accrued &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1336941257965375489"&gt;8 million preorders&lt;/a&gt;. One day after the game’s release, CD Projekt Red said digital preorders &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-65-2020/"&gt;had recouped&lt;/a&gt; all of the game’s development and marketing costs. And the studio said that the game had sold more than 13 million copies as of December 20th in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-67-2020/"&gt;memo shared on December 22nd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtK1gL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; drove massive sales even though its launch was a huge mess. The game had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;bugs and issues on many platforms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun"&gt;ran particularly poorly on older consoles&lt;/a&gt;, forcing CD Projekt Red to quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt;. The game’s performance and fan outcry were so bad that Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;yanked the game from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; just one week after launch, and months later, it still hasn’t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uR4VyW"&gt;CD Projekt Red also said on Thursday that its hit RPG &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; sold more than 30 million copies, making 2020 “the second best year in [the game’s] history with regard to the number of copies sold.” In addition, the studio committed to releasing PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S-optimized versions of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3 &lt;/em&gt;in the second half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin’s new Venu 2 watches have better battery life and more features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Garmin’s new Venu 2 (left) and the smaller Venu 2S (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xyetjxsii5JQFc0TBe9XMMOR4Y8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169899/garminvenu2series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Garmin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BLEnDr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 22nd, 1:12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated the first paragraph to reflect that Garmin wouldn’t disclose how long its introductory price of $319.99 will last.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4W9nLX"&gt;Garmin has upgraded its premium Venu smartwatch for 2021 (via &lt;a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/04/garmin-venu2-venu2s-smartwatch-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DC Rainmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/garmins-2-new-smartwatches-want-to-make-the-casual-athlete-more-advanced/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It now comes in two sizes instead of a single 43mm-sized model. The 45mm Venu 2 houses a 1.3-inch 416 x 416 OLED screen. For smaller wrists (or those who just prefer a less wrist-dominating device), the 40mm Venu 2S has a 1.1-inch 360 x 360 OLED screen. Both watches have an optional always-on mode, and they &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F707538&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F22%2F22397488%2Fgarmin-venu-2-2s-smartwatch-fitness-tracking-health-sports-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available now for an introductory cost of $319.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is $80 cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20848816/garmin-venu-vivoactive-vivomove-gps-sport-watch-price-date-specs"&gt;original Venu&lt;/a&gt; when it launched in late 2019. Garmin hasn’t shared how long this price will be in effect (the product pages mention a $399.99 asking price), and the company declined to disclose how long this lower price will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpzlUH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doubles the battery life in some cases versus the original&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ1Pkp"&gt;Other than the differences in case sizes, there isn’t much else distinguishing the Venu 2 lineup visually from the predecessor. They’re slick-looking touchscreen wearables with Gorilla Glass 3-covered touchscreens that feature two buttons. One of the biggest gen-to-gen improvements is its battery performance. The original Venu could last five days in smartwatch mode, but Garmin’s bigger 45mm Venu 2 watch doubles it (and then some) to a claim of 11 days of operation if you’re just using it for getting phone notifications with light usage otherwise. If you’re using its built-in GPS and streaming music from the watch to your headphones via Bluetooth, Garmin predicts up to eight hours of battery life, up from six in the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zaFDAK"&gt;Surprisingly, the smaller 40mm Venu 2S also has better battery life than the original, with 10 days of use expected in smartwatch mode or up to seven hours in GPS mode with music. &lt;a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=A1gzB6SLZF6e9nnyZOfFM6"&gt;Garmin has a whole page that backs up how it makes predictions on battery life&lt;/a&gt;, telling you what to expect depending on the kind of activities you’re doing. Garmin is also touting faster recharging for both models, with 10 minutes of charging giving you up to one day of use in smartwatch mode or an hour of GPS usage with music. Both models can store up to 650 songs from Spotify, Amazon Music, or Deezer, up from 500 in the Venu and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451145/garmin-venu-sq-music-edition-smartwatch-gps-spotify-nfc-wearable-blood-oxygen"&gt;2020 Venu Sq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdo9z1"&gt;The Venu 2 watches are packed with sensors, featuring a heart rate sensor, GPS (GLONASS and Galileo), a wrist-based pulse ox sensor to measure blood oxygen, a barometric altimeter for altitude, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer, thermometer, and an ambient light sensor. Each watch also features NFC for the Garmin Pay contactless payment feature. These watches work with iOS and Android, but only on Android can you respond to text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPPPue"&gt;In terms of new software features coming to the watches, Garmin’s Sleep Score will give you an aggregate score based on tracking your sleep stages, heart rate, stress, respiration, and your blood oxygen levels. The Venu 2 series can estimate your “Fitness Age” based on your level of activity and can guide you through high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and advanced strength training.&lt;/p&gt;
