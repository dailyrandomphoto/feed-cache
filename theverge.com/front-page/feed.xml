    <title>Death Stranding: Director’s Cut isn’t a director’s cut, says director Hideo Kojima</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Death Stranding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TQoGWOh9q_7C-xiTUxWbc3G9ZY=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570882/DEATH_STRANDING_20200406165104.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJpU8s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569182/death-stranding-directors-cut-new-features-release-date-ps5"&gt;coming to the PS5 on September 24th&lt;/a&gt; — but don’t call it a director’s cut, according to director Hideo Kojima (&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-12-kojima-disagrees-with-death-stranding-directors-cut-title"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGviEl"&gt;“A director’s cut in a movie is an additional edit to a shortened version that was either released reluctantly because the director did not have the right to edit it, or because the running time had to be shortened,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1414442896367915015"&gt;Kojima explained on Twitter this morning&lt;/a&gt;. “In the game, it is not what was cut, but what was additionally produced that was included. Delector’s [sic] Plus? So, in my opinion, I don’t like to call ‘director’s cut’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jhmg63"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/2&lt;br&gt;In the game, it is not what was cut, but what was additionally produced that was included. Delector's Plus? So, in my opinion, I don't like to call "director's cut".&lt;/p&gt;— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1414442896367915015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eYxdTB"&gt;Based on Kojima’s tweets, it seems that the new content coming to &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; isn’t missions or mechanics that had to be cut out due to time or budget. Kojima’s directorial vision for the game isn’t only now being restored; the PS5 version is just getting new elements that are created specifically for this re-release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUjzxa"&gt;It’s a misuse of the idea of a director’s cut that Sony has already started to lean on with the recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a new island to explore with added story content, characters, armor, and enemies; a long-awaited fix for proper lip-syncing for the game’s Japanese voiceover; and DualSense-specific features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. They’re nice additions, but no one at Sony or Sucker Punch seems to be claiming that they’re part of &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell’s original restored vision. (Neither Fox nor Connell is &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/01/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-arrives-on-ps5-and-ps4-consoles-on-august-20/"&gt;even mentioned in the announcement&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qqUN6T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ghost of Tsushima is getting an enhanced director’s cut on the PS4 and PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="U9ztsL"&gt;Rather, it seems that Sony is using “director’s cut” as a catch-all phrase for an expanded edition of a game that it’s re-releasing for next-generation consoles with some added DLC. It’s the sort of title that gives the re-releases a veneer of artistic high ground that an “expanded edition” or “game of the year” release doesn’t. Charging an extra $10 or $30 for a PS5 version of a title with a few minor upgrades is a tough sell. But charging that price to play Kojima’s unadulterated vision of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding &lt;/em&gt;is presumably an easier sell, even if the reality just isn’t the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tn2XKJ"&gt;Of course, contentious director’s cuts are nothing new: consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16404444/which-blade-runner-version-to-watch-ridley-scott-theatrical-cut-final"&gt;infamous &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was based on a workprint version of the movie but wasn’t actually produced directly by director Ridley Scott. (Scott was able to produce a version of the film with total artistic control in 2007, known as &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm1r9B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok gets a Fire TV app in the UK, France, and Germany</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riO8ZfmY8haINXGDHBvsPt1dh7g=/201x0:2358x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570785/ApplicationFrameHost_qin6ujiovB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o4yKjg"&gt;TikTok is now available on Fire TV devices in the UK, France, and Germany, the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-is-now-on-amazon-fire-tv"&gt;video platform announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The app, which will be available starting today, lets viewers watch content from the service’s “For You” and “Following” feeds. There’s also a “Discover” page to help users find trending content. The app is available to download from the Amazon Appstore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl68q6"&gt;The service’s Fire TV app follows its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;launch on Samsung TVs last year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-on-google-tv-and-android-tv-is-here"&gt;Google TV and Android TV in February&lt;/a&gt;. Thus far, these apps have been exclusive to Europe, but the company recently &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/tiktok-tv-bytedance"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on bringing them to more markets.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Meanwhile, in the US, TikTok launched an app called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;“More on TikTok” on Fire TV devices&lt;/a&gt; last year. That app is limited to a more curated selection of popular videos, rather than the personalized feeds TikTok’s other apps are built around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SWAPCp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vertical videos on landscape TVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zss1pC"&gt;TikTok’s experiments with TV apps are seen as an attempt for the service to reach a wider audience, but they could also allow it to benefit from the premium rates associated with TV-based advertising, according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. The launch of the TV apps has also coincided with TikTok’s push into longer videos. Earlier this month, it started letting all users publish videos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;up to three minutes long&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60TAwB"&gt;These TV apps present challenges for a service designed around quickly swiping through vertically shot videos on mobile. Using a remote typically isn’t as fast as a touchscreen interface, and each vertical video only takes up a small sliver of the middle of a landscape TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7OPWk9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"The Verge on Tiktok","description":"Join us for Tiktoks about the future of technology and science","label":"Follow us!","url":"https://bit.ly/3ho6J5U"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Five ‘Dead Startups’ from Juicero to Coolest Cooler parodied as toys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GF8gKNsq-7kGv-O5_iU_RdEG_M0=/0x0:1869x1246/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570699/msedge_B1KdLel803.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five toys based on iconic startup failures.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://deadstartuptoys.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dead Startup Toys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UuJpUg"&gt;For its latest drop, internet collective MSCHF is releasing five famous startup failures as miniature toys for $40 each, or $160 for a set. The &lt;a href="https://deadstartuptoys.com"&gt;Dead Startup Toys drop&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15357340/juicero-juicer-not-actually-necessary-for-juicing"&gt;Juicero&lt;/a&gt; juicer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now"&gt;One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)&lt;/a&gt; rugged laptop, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348766/theranos-minilab-machine-edison-scandal"&gt;Theranos miniLab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;Jibo social robot&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21003445/coolest-cooler-update-business-tariffs-kickstarter"&gt;Coolest Cooler&lt;/a&gt;, which MSCHF calls the “poster child for the pitfalls of crowdfunding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw3gIH"&gt;“This is not a memorialization,” MSCHF says, “but perhaps they are a form of necromancy: we celebrate their pale shadows, deprived of their original context.” Describing the toys as the equivalent to “a line of heads on stakes,” MSCHF invites us to “behold these beautiful mutants, hoisted on petards of their own solid-aluminum-unibody construction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c98Uq9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10648036"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yeDsy5"&gt;The failures range from the overly ambitious and misguided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now"&gt;One Laptop Per Child project&lt;/a&gt; — which attempted to build an open-source $100 laptop for use by children in the developing world — to the Juicero juicer, which squeezed proprietary bags of pre-prepared juice roughly as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15357340/juicero-juicer-not-actually-necessary-for-juicing"&gt;a pair of human hands&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the Coolest Cooler, a do-too-much cooler that went through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/18/9758214/coolest-cooler-amazon-kickstater-shipping-production-delay"&gt;chaotically mismanaged crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Rounding out the collection are toys based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;Jibo social robot&lt;/a&gt; (which had “little to no practical functionality,” according to MSCHF) and the Theranos miniLab, a printer-sized blood-testing machine that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17469310/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-biotechnology-health-science"&gt;fraudulently&lt;/a&gt; claimed would diagnose a range of illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oigrt0"&gt;Many of MSCHF’s previous projects have raised the ire of the companies they’ve parodied. It recently initiated a “voluntary recall” of its run of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374480/nike-mschf-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-lawsuit-settled"&gt;unofficially modified Satan-themed sneakers&lt;/a&gt; in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;trademark dispute from Nike&lt;/a&gt;. It also received pushback from Boston Dynamics after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295091/mschf-drop-boston-dynamics-spot-paintball-gun-art-gallery"&gt;strapped a paintball gun&lt;/a&gt; to the back of one of the company’s Spot robot dogs and let members of the public control it in an art gallery. “We condemn the portrayal of our technology in any way that promotes violence, harm, or intimidation,” Boston Dynamics said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgjeCI"&gt;The limited edition toys are available now, &lt;a href="https://deadstartuptoys.com/"&gt;direct from MSCHF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drought is stressing California’s power grid  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Drought Conditions at Lake Oroville" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-ONrCrKIGFAIQCMbEIYh9nNzZg=/2x0:5998x3997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570672/1324150033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In an aerial view, houseboats whose owners chose to leave them in the lake, float at a water level nearly 200 feet below normal at the Lime Saddle Marina for Lake Oroville near Paradise, California, on June 8th, 2021. Drought has caused the water level to drop in Lake Oroville several hundred feet, leaving houseboat owners to make a choice to leave their craft in the water or to remove them since boat ramps will not reach the low level of the water as it drops lower and lower.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Carlos Avila Gonzalez / The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g1JX4H"&gt;Drought is putting pressure on California’s already stressed-out grid. As water reservoirs run dry, there’s been a significant drop in hydroelectric generation. Without enough water pressure to quickly turn turbine blades, there could be electricity shortages right when residents need it the most.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXDQLB"&gt;Rolling blackouts have already become a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908434/california-blackouts-utilities-fires-lawsuits-san-francisco-bay-area-pge-pacific-gas-electric"&gt;new norm&lt;/a&gt; for the state as utilities shut down power lines in an attempt to avoid sparking fires during hot, dry weather. But summertime outages also occur when residents crank up their air conditioners to beat the heat and demand outpaces the available power supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p2tlef"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“California relies on hydro for so much of its demand, so any drought can put the state in a tight position.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UIFjU"&gt;“California relies on hydro for so much of its demand, so any drought can put the state in a tight position,” said Lindsay Aramayo, an industry economist with the US Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ6v0a"&gt;Hydropower is a significant source of energy for the state. &lt;a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/2020-total-system-electric-generation/2019"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it made up about 17 percent of California’s electricity mix. And while California is no stranger to drought, this is particularly bad. More than a third of the state is experiencing “exceptional drought,” and more than 40 percent of its residents are living under a drought state of emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhAdSs"&gt;The two largest reservoirs in California, Lake Shasta and Lake Oroville, are both at less than half of their capacity. Water levels are even lower at Lake Mead, which hit its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;lowest mark &lt;/a&gt;since the Hoover Dam was built in 1931. The drought is expected to &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/06/24/lake-oroville-level-falls-hydro-power-shut-first/"&gt;force Oroville’s hydropower plant offline&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever. Smaller reservoirs are in trouble, too. At California’s Folsom Lake, the remains of a plane that went down in 1986 &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/16/california-folsom-lake-mystery-plane-crash"&gt;surfaced&lt;/a&gt; because the reservoir was so empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHMhB1"&gt;While farmers &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com./2021/05/23/facing-a-drought-californias-farmers-make-hard-choices/"&gt;abandon thirsty crops&lt;/a&gt; and the state’s governor &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-08/newsom-new-drought-declarations-california"&gt;pleads with residents&lt;/a&gt; to save water at home, the drought has already cut into the state’s power supply. Hydroelectric generation dropped by 37 percent during the first four months of the year compared to the same period in 2020. It’s down a whopping 71 percent compared to that time in 2019. That trend is expected to continue this year, the US Energy Information Administration &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48616"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LISObN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drought has already cut into the state’s power supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vr1tU5"&gt;Earlier this month, state energy authorities decided to purchase additional power to avoid outages this summer. It’s a step that’s only taken when a “&lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/CapacityProcurementMechanismSignificantEvent-Intent-Solicit-DesignateCapacity-070121.html"&gt;significant event&lt;/a&gt;” poses a risk to the reliability of the grid. It could purchase energy from other states, but places it typically imports from, like the Pacific Northwest, are also &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47456"&gt;facing drought&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCRNAw"&gt;“Summer has barely begun and we have already had repeated extreme heat events creating dangerous conditions and shattering records across the country,” said a &lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/CapacityProcurementMechanismSignificantEvent-JointStatementandLetter.pdf"&gt;July 1st joint statement&lt;/a&gt; from the heads of the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission, and California Independent System Operator. “Unprecedented” heat and drought driven by climate change are forcing California to act, the statement said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BM1C9p"&gt;Water and energy shortages may force the state to turn to more fossil fuels for electricity. Natural gas power plants frequently step in to meet peak demand during the summer. That can mean slightly higher utility bills for residents since hydropower is pretty cheap in California. A drought from 2012–2015 cost ratepayers about $2 billion, according to one &lt;a href="https://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Impacts-Californias-Ongoing-Drought-Hydroelectricity-Generation-2015-Update.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the nonprofit research group Pacific Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cQ5rkV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’d like to break that cycle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvIsUc"&gt;There’s another problem: natural gas power plants, unlike dams, pump out greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Droughts were actually responsible for roughly 10 percent of average annual carbon dioxide emissions from generating power in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington from 2001 and 2015, according to a &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2018/12/21/droughts-boost-ehydropower-dries/"&gt;Stanford analysis&lt;/a&gt;. All of those emissions fuel more climate change, which, in turn, drives even more severe droughts in the Western US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys3Emf"&gt;“That’s a bad cycle, and we’d like to break that cycle, so that during droughts we’re making up our lost hydro power with other non-carbon [polluting] energy sources,” says Peter Gleick, climate scientist and president emeritus of the Pacific Institute. The good news is there’s now more solar and wind energy online to fill in the shortfall from hydropower. But Gleick is still concerned that the drought will ultimately result in more pollution while further stressing California’s power grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuBDwA"&gt;“It’s really an indication that we’re going to have to invest in strengthening the grid across the country in the face of climate change,” Gleick says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s kids Fire tablets are on sale just in time for that summer trip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDnpGiOnpzo06k_07T4XhZK30Vs=/0x0:6127x4085/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570251/dseifert_4649_fire_hd_10_2021_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9BQujQ"&gt;Summer is here, and for many families, that means it’s finally time to take the vacation they’ve been postponing for the past 18 months. With vacations comes travel, and with travel comes bored kids, so it’s crucial to have something to entertain them when they’re in the car or on a plane for hours on end. Amazon’s got you covered today with discounts across its lineup of kids-specific Fire tablets, including the recently released Fire HD 10 Kids and HD 10 Kids Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDRLwm"&gt;The kids versions of the Fire tablets are essentially the same hardware as the standard models and come in 7-, 8-, or 10-inch sizes. They include a kid-friendly case with a built-in kickstand, two years of protection against damage, and a year’s subscription to Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which provides a kid-friendly interface and access to age-appropriate games, apps, video, and books on the tablets. Each size is available in specific versions for ages 3 to 7 or ages 6 to 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNCh7N"&gt;The base 7-inch model normally costs $100, but Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H8WS1FT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted it to $60 today&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with 16GB of internal storage, has up to seven hours of battery life, and charges via Micro USB port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4XrKsd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zcnkrR"&gt;If you step up to the 8-inch version, you not only get a larger screen, but you also get double the storage (now 32GB), twice as much RAM, a faster processor, up to 12 hours of battery life, and USB-C charging. Amazon normally sells this version for $140 but has it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Edition-tablet/dp/B07WDDT3G5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $90 today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ZWvXG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648106"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wt16bS"&gt;The top-tier 10-inch version, which was just updated earlier this year, includes a bigger, better-quality screen, an even faster processor and more RAM, and up to 12 hours of battery life with USB-C charging. This model’s regular price is $200, but today’s sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F62DV1Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brings it down to $130&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9krmZG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MqdWia"&gt;No matter which model you go with, it’s smart to also grab a microSD card to expand the amount of offline storage you have for it. The Fire HD tablets let you save games, videos, books, and apps for offline use, which is great for in the car or on a plane. A reliable, 64GB Sandisk microSD card should cover even the longest trips and can be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-ULTRA-microSDXC-Class-SDSDQUA-064G-A11A/dp/9875981818?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;picked up for $11&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve got two kids, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-microSDXC-UHS-I-Adapter/dp/B0735NNFLQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-pack of that same card is $19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RM1lsz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648119"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="E2WPnz"&gt;
&lt;p id="PTmSsQ"&gt;If you’re looking to treat yourself to some silence on that road trip, Woot has the &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergedeals071221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-anc-wireless-earbuds-international-model%3Fref%3Dw_gw_dd_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro for $120 today&lt;/a&gt;, a discount of $80 off their regular price and considerably less than the typical sales we’ve seen so far. The Buds Pro provide active noise cancellation to help block outside sound and last for five hours between charges with it enabled. The version Woot is selling is the international model, which has the same specs as the US version, but comes with a 90-day warranty provided by Woot instead of the full-year warranty through Samsung. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AGyeWR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZOtCWL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="atWkb2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s too late for Black Widow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jy6hRzcjkc9rsPI4wnyaO2AcSYE=/0x0:4089x2726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570210/7845a8b610b38e85a4395b809d7764c6_4096x2726_322c95ed.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Marvel’s latest film thoroughly skewers the franchise’s portrayal of Black Widow... far too late&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WjXd57"&gt;It’s hard to be a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Black Widow. She sticks out like a sore thumb. On a team of super-powered guys (and Hawkeye), she fills the less cinematic “master manipulator” and “weird sexy martial art flippity flips” roles. Her story until &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has been about as nuanced and impactful as that of Smurfette’s. When she has been given more to do than pose in front of explosions or take people down with her thighs, the storylines have been so heavily critiqued they’ve turned punchline in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3mUxs"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt; she was crammed into a hamfisted romance with the Hulk that was immediately mocked in &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;. Her big swan dive into oblivion in &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; for the sake of her “boys,” the Avengers, is repeatedly mocked in her titular film, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;. For the first heroine of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Natasha Romanoff often feels like a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slytherinus/status/1413556375104507913"&gt;big joke&lt;/a&gt;. And this attempt to rehabilitate her posthumously feels like far too little far too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve7b31"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Black Widow,&lt;/em&gt; director Cate Shortland and screenwriters Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson are clearly trying to recontextualize Natasha Romanoff and find a genuinely interesting character buried under a decade of oversexualized junk. The problem is that’s really hard to do. This character carries a lot of baggage — way more than Wanda Maximoff — who Schaeffer handily rehabilitated in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0c41lG"&gt;Wanda could have a bad rap in the films, but she is also still alive by the end of each chapter in her story. She can be transformed into a dynamic character with wants and desires beyond what a handful of male directors shunted onto her in a few films. Natasha Romanoff doesn’t have the same luxury. She can’t be dynamic because her story is already told. We’ve already witnessed her endgame. She tells Hawkeye she’s a not-great person and the least she can do is kill herself so some men, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html"&gt;her “boys,” can live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; creaks under the weight of this future. The filmmakers build up a rich and nuanced life for her that doesn’t revolve around the Avengers. It’s meant to be a curtain pulled back; an exploration of what made her tick and what led to her decision to swan dive into oblivion. Instead it feels like desperate and sweaty justification for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/avengers-endgames-women-deserved-more-1834388344"&gt;a widely maligned move&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXcRqA26xdQdMtzFXUQuIqtNpAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708798/9b242b6fdd726ace32e612d5a40e6028_4096x2727_1c974df6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Costuming subtly hints that maybe the skintight catsuit is a Natasha Romanoff choice and not a Black Widow one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh9f8M"&gt;It’s not the filmmakers’ fault that Natasha Romanoff has been the “sexy Avenger” all this time. It’s not their fault that Spider-Man got a movie before Natasha or that &lt;a href="https://www.themarysue.com/black-widow-flash-mob/"&gt;the character was missing from so much merchandise&lt;/a&gt; it inspired multiple hashtags. Black Widow has been short shrifted for years. One film with a handful of very good jokes was always going to struggle to make up for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZGIH"&gt;But the filmmakers do try to fix what was broken before they came along. In one of the standout moments of the film, Natasha is eluding a worldwide manhunt while doing absolutely nothing to change her appearance. As she drops some cash for snacks at a gas station her adoptive sister Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh, pointedly begins mocking Natasha’s tendency to pose and flip her hair after doing something athletically impressive. It’s extremely funny, and a great character moment — a sister ragging on one of the most humorless heroes in the MCU. It’s the filmmakers speaking through Yelena, chastising a decade of fetishization by Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, and the Russo brothers while neatly establishing that Yelena will be different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw2LSp"&gt;“See,” Marvel seems to say. “We get that we told women to wait their turn for a decade. We acknowledge our sins and would like you to overlook them because Pugh and Johansson have great chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8aYPv"&gt;I spent a lot of the movie torn between being annoyed at the cookie Marvel was meting out and actually loving the taste of the thing. Then the movie embraces the gallows humor one would expect a bunch of lifetime assassins and spies to engage in, when Natasha and Yelena go into graphic details of their forced sterilization as a joke. The movie later descends into the rote beats of the MCU’s more militaristic fare, but this moment, which savagely addresses a key and controversial plot point from &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;, makes it all almost feel like it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBgJ2Ak77xOdOrZFtNjPXjt9dTw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708810/4410b599399a2b532e05d490c46f60da_4096x2725_ca977a97.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Natasha and Yelena are the kind of sisters who would make fun of their own extreme trauma.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BEuJSK"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt; Natasha tearfully breaks up with Bruce Banner, who she has apparently hooked up with between movies. When he begs to know why they can’t be together and assumes it’s because he turns into an uncontrollable green monster on occasion, Natasha says no. It’s because &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is the monster. She was forcibly sterilized in the Red Room and can never have children. The &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/black-widow-this-is-why-we-can-t-have-nice-things-1702333037"&gt;criticism of Black Widow’s arc&lt;/a&gt; was severe, particularly her infantilizing relationship with the Hulk. &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/05/04/joss-whedon-quits-twitter/"&gt;Joss Whedon reportedly even left Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MgXWu"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;Yelena, and then Natasha, go on a black comedy riff over their barren wombs to the discomfort of the Red Guardian, who acted as their father in a spy-op 20 years earlier before turning them over to the Red Room to become Black Widows. Where once Natasha said it made her a monster, here it’s something to joke about with her younger, similarly affected, sister. It feels more genuine, and certainly less maudlin, than crowing about being a monster before finding a facsimile of motherhood in crooning lullabies to a giant green man. This was the Black Widow of the comics, and the promise of the character as seen in &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; (and to a lesser extent &lt;em&gt;Civil War&lt;/em&gt;): an assassin with a pitch-black sense of humor, using it to make her pretend spy dad uncomfortable for his complicity in her child soldier past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeM7NR"&gt;It’s a pity Natasha is still dead, and Scarlet Johansson is done with the franchise, because for a few minutes we got what we’d been promised 12 years ago when &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/emily-blunt-rumored-for-iron-man-2-1117998515/"&gt;Emily Blunt was first rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be joining the nascent MCU as Black Widow. Like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth, she spent over a decade of her career on this franchise. They each got a trilogy of films interrogating their character’s purpose in the MCU. She got a prequel trying to soften the blow of her abrupt departure. The movie was fun, and there are moments in it that are even excellent, but it all feels like far too little, far too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CBeBXj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567297/black-widows-post-credit-scene-explained-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;Thanks to a post-credits sequence&lt;/a&gt;, we know Pugh is next headed to the Disney Plus show &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s hope her Black Widow is treated a little kinder by the MCU. But as she’s already being pitted against Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld’s Hawkeyes, I wouldn’t get too optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redesigned iPad mini reportedly on track to launch this fall</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5rP4CJ"&gt;Apple plans to release a new iPad mini featuring “the biggest redesign in [its] nine-year history” this fall, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-11/apple-card-would-rival-amex-platinum-and-chase-sapphire-reserve-kqzi5vme?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/11/ipad-mini-redesign-larger-imac-apple-silicon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new device is expected to feature slimmer bezels, a larger display, faster performance, and a design similar to Apple’s new iPad Air from last year, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/sixth-generation-ipad-mini-this-fall/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. It could be a big shakeup for Apple’s smallest tablet, whose design has remained remarkably consistent since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;its debut in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zE0Oy5"&gt;The news tallies with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous reporting about the upcoming device, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518167/2022-ipad-pro-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini-2021-date"&gt;it said last month&lt;/a&gt; could ditch the home button to allow for narrower screen bezels. Reports of an iPad Air-style design suggests it could use a Touch ID sensor built into a side-mounted power button. Last year, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/14/ipad-mini-apple-glasses-kuo/"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s next iPad mini could have a screen that’s 8.5 to 9-inches in size, up from the 7.9-inch display the mini has always sported. Kuo has also previously suggested a future iPad mini &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/"&gt;could use a similar Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt; to what we recently saw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s largest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTfFwn"&gt;The new iPad mini would be the 6th generation of the tablet, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;a 2019 redesign&lt;/a&gt; that added support for the Apple Pencil stylus alongside a faster A12 processor. As well as the new iPad mini, Gurman also reports that Apple also has another Apple Silicon powered iMac on the way with a larger screen than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;recent 24-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. The new device is reportedly intended to replace the existing Intel-powered 27-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn and TSMC strike deal to buy 10 million COVID vaccines for Taiwan</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5Z5i0"&gt;Foxconn and TSMC, two Taiwanese giants of the international tech supply chain, have agreed to buy 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses for the island in a move that dodges a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22539799/taiwan-vaccine-negotiations-tsmc-foxconn-china-interference"&gt;standoff between Taipei and Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies will be paying up to $35 a dose of the BioNTech vaccine and donating them to the government; each company has pledged to spend $175 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaLXVT"&gt;BioNTech is partnered with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co. to distribute its mRNA-based vaccine, which was co-developed with Pfizer, within China. Taiwan claims that the Chinese government blocked an attempt to secure a supply of vaccines from BioNTech, and later refused an offer of vaccine donations from the mainland. With the new arrangement, however, BioNTech and Fosun are being allowed to deal with private companies rather than the Taiwanese government, which Beijing views as illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVmBhB"&gt;“Since we proposed the vaccine donation and started negotiating for the purchase, there had been no guidance or interference from Beijing over the acquisition,” Foxconn founder Terry Gou wrote &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TerryGou1018/posts/1201726933633910"&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, in remarks translated &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/Foxconn-and-TSMC-sign-350m-deal-to-buy-COVID-vaccines-for-Taiwan"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We appreciate that the negotiation was allowed to go through as a business matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6wqgqD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New COVID-19 outbreaks in Asia could exacerbate the global chip shortage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530908/covid-19-outbreaks-asia-global-chip-semiconductor-shortage"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZH1Up3"&gt;Foxconn is a huge contract electronics manufacturer with major clients including HP, Dell, and Lenovo, and it’s best known for being the largest iPhone assembler. TSMC is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing chips to spec for the likes of AMD, Apple and Nvidia; it’s responsible for the majority of smartphone SoCs worldwide. Most of Foxconn’s manufacturing happens in China and other countries, but TSMC’s main operating base is in the Hsinchu region of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKxLqR"&gt;Taiwan has been widely praised for its response to the pandemic, but is currently experiencing an outbreak that has killed more than 700 people and hastened the demand for vaccines. Last week the government said that a little over 14 percent of the population, or about 3.3 million people, had received one vaccine shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVnBS3"&gt;TSMC and Foxconn say the newly secured BioNTech doses will be shipped from its factories in Germany and should start to arrive in Taiwan from late September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked device lineup may have been entirely spoiled in huge new leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_XAJ-m4N_IHv_0MM-zJOyt6i5o=/0x35:608x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69568466/Screen_Shot_2021_07_11_at_3.56.50_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3, from GIFs shared by leaker Evan Blass.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fmaqzO"&gt;We might now know a lot of what’s coming at Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked event thanks to a series of tweets from noted leaker Evan Blass. It seems like the event could be a big one, as Blass tweeted a long thread with GIFs of two new Galaxy foldables, a new Galaxy FE phone, two new Galaxy Watches, and even a set of new Galaxy Buds. He also says the event is set to take place &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423"&gt;one month from now on August 11th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqej9"&gt;First up, the foldables. Blass has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;already leaked&lt;/a&gt; what appear to be official renders of the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which could support the S Pen stylus) and Galaxy Z Flip 3, but the new GIFs he shared give looks at both devices at all angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLbvNC"&gt;Here’s the Z Fold 3, which Blass shared GIFs of in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734357328699396"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734378996371456"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6izswb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zbFJvcSfv9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zbFJvcSfv9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBafbK"&gt;And here’s the Z Flip 3, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734389691953152"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734410827046913"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734420817891330"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lfD1KQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/cLlE0ot4fO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLlE0ot4fO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jp100o"&gt;Blass’ thread also includes GIFs of what look to be the rumored Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734430577938432"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570"&gt;a yellow-ish gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734449896992771"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734459933958145"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;. The phone, if released, will likely be a mid-range version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;the S21&lt;/a&gt; and looks to take a lot of design inspiration from the Samsung flagship (like how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; looked similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21172039/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review-camera-5g-screen-android"&gt;the S20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzXdQR"&gt;Whether or not this phone is actually in production has been something of an open question; in June, in response to a report claiming Samsung had stopped production of the phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung said that&lt;/a&gt; “nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.” These GIFs from Blass might be a sign that the phone is a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yPJmT8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/ovz5bzR8me"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ovz5bzR8me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzQagF"&gt;But Blass didn’t just share GIFs of phones — he also tweeted GIFs of two new Samsung watches. One model seems to match closely with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;rumors of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;, with what appears to be a rotating bezel and two buttons on the right side. The watch, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734469920509952"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734490271322114"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, is also expected to run &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;Google and Samsung’s new smartwatch platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TdDWiU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/A090015v7k"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A090015v7k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSPP4H"&gt;The other watch shared by Blass appears to match &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;rumors of the Galaxy Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;. This watch doesn’t look to have a rotating bezel, and according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1407653639011905539"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-5k-renders-details/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GizNext&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it might come in two different sizes: 44mm and 40mm. Blass shared GIFs of the watch in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734503168741380"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257"&gt;dark green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734530045915137"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734543111163906"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;, and two tweets of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734555039805443"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734567089950721"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; (though I can’t tell the difference between them besides what’s shown on the screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z2PZ7z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Ej15bzU6nE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ej15bzU6nE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kBPt5"&gt;Blass’ GIF thread also reveals three colors of unannounced Galaxy Buds that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;match rumors about the Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, which, according to leaker Ice Universe, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1412399234419023875"&gt;will have active noice cancelation&lt;/a&gt;. Blass’ GIFs show the buds and the inside of the white case in gray, purple, and white, matching the style of a leaked render &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that showed green, black, and white bud / inner case combos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JpGAqU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zt54JopQzc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zt54JopQzc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734590846492674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpeuP"&gt;Finally, let’s talk quickly about that rumored date, August 11th, which to me seems like the one you might want to circle on your calendar. When Samsung showed off its smartwatch platform developed with Google at the end of June, it said there would be an Unpacked event “&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/mwc-2021-samsung-presents-new-watch-experience-with-a-sneak-peek-of-one-ui-watch"&gt;later this summer&lt;/a&gt;,” so August 11th would fall in that timeline. And the company has hosted summer Unpacked events in early August for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17665284/samsung-galaxy-note-9-watch-bixby-home-speaker-news-unpacked-event-2018"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754898/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-5g-book-s-pen-unpacked-event-2019-biggest-announcements-news-recap"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21350066/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-note-20-event-biggest-announcements-products-recap"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;, meaning August 11th wouldn’t be out of the usual pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuHLqO"&gt;Since Samsung hasn’t officially announced any of these products or the date of the event, there’s always the chance that what Blass leaked doesn’t actually come out. But given Blass’ past track record and the detail of the GIFs he shared, it seems possible he may well have revealed some of the biggest news from Samsung’s next Unpacked event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Widow has been a big hit on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKlpuWW2xfFert6I-lkxqOy5dCA=/0x8:1231x829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69568084/fbg7020_comp_v003.1049_r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQzNME"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is the first Marvel movie to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1096468/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fblack-widow%2F3VfTap90rwZC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;the same day it hit theaters, and based on financial figures Disney released on Sunday, the movie has been very successful on the streaming service in its first weekend, where it is available as a Premier Access title. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/black-widow-opening-weekend-box-office-1234789473/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the movie has earned $60 million in sales on Disney Plus, which isn’t far behind the $80 million it earned in domestic box office sales and the $78 million it earned internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znuZCK"&gt;Disney first introduced the Premier Access program, which lets Disney Plus subscribers stream select new movies for $30 the day they debut in theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;with 2020’s &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were also available on Premier Access when they were released this year. But these &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; figures are the first Disney has shared about how a film has performed on Premier Access, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports, and they indicate that streaming at home is still a popular way to see the film even though taking a trip to the movies is an option for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YoJL3q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s only one more Premier Access movie on the way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh12Rv"&gt;However, it’s not clear if Disney will be offering many movies through Premier Access going forward. The only remaining Premier Access film in the pipeline (that we know of) is &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt;, which will be released &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jungle-cruise-to-debut-in-theaters-and-on-disney-premier-access/"&gt;in theaters and on Disney Plus on July 30th&lt;/a&gt;. And Disney has already announced that &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;(which is the next Marvel flick)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are debuting exclusively in theaters on August 13th and September 3rd, respectively (though they’ll have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;a shortened 45-day theatrical exclusivity window&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FikuqR"&gt;Disney also isn’t the only one turning its focus back to theater-first debuts: Warner Bros. will return to releasing films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;exclusively on the big screen in 2022&lt;/a&gt; after premiering all of its 2021 movies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps the strong performance of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; on Premier Access will make Disney consider releasing future titles on Disney Plus when they hit theaters. (If anyone from Disney is reading this, I’d love to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the comfort of my living room when it comes out.)&lt;/p&gt;
