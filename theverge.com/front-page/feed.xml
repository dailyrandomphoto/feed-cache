    <title>Snag a refurbished, waterproof Kindle Oasis for $100 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cfs4g1"&gt;If you’re currently searching for a Kindle e-reader to buy, the best one for your money is the Kindle Oasis. Normally, that wouldn’t be the case, since they cost $250 new, but Woot has the 2018 version (the previous generation) available refurbished starting at $100. That price will get you the 8GB version with Wi-Fi support. Though, if you want 32GB of storage and cellular connectivity, the step-up model costs $140, which isn’t a bad price. Currently, Woot has the graphite color of both models in “very good” condition, and they’re covered by a 90-day warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUtuOn"&gt;As for why you might want the Oasis over the Paperwhite, it has a higher-resolution display (but the same pixel density as the Paperwhite), and it has more front LEDs that make the screen look more naturally lit. In terms of design, the Oasis might get the edge because of its side grip that has a few touch-sensitive buttons. My colleague Chaim Gartenberg says that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/30/18644795/kindle-oasis-amazon-button-page-turn-book-e-reader"&gt;make the Oasis feel more like holding an actual book&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w90y1U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10419831"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9FOkE"&gt;Another solid deal happening at Woot is on the Beats Solo Pro wireless headphones that have active noise cancellation. We’re including them here today because they’ve dropped another $5 below the best price yet. You can get the light blue color for $145, while the others available are $150. These are Beats’ best on-ear headphones yet, though people who aren’t enmeshed in the Apple ecosystem might want to know upfront that they recharge via Lightning. If you have an iPhone or iPad, there’ll be no adjustment necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tOwYwy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="upHxe9"&gt;Apple’s latest MacBook Air equipped with its M1 processor is $50 off at Best Buy and Amazon. It’s not a huge price drop, but it’s less than what Apple is charging for the same model. This laptop has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. For the price, you’ll get fantastic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yg2xIT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen is really rebranding as ‘Voltswagen’ in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMZw1oqsursZ1FT2ZyxUpONW9c4=/0x120:716x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048185/Large_13212_VoltswagenAnewnameforaneweraofe_Mobility.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zveic"&gt;Volkswagen is changing the name of its American brand to Voltswagen, in a not-so-subtle nod to the German automaker’s multibillion-dollar effort to become the biggest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HgHZ6"&gt;The company was apparently planning to make the announcement at the end of April but accidentally published a press release about the name change early Monday afternoon, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html"&gt;first spotted by CNBC&lt;/a&gt; before it was taken down. The proximity of the name change to April Fool’s Day initially raised suspicions that it was just a joke. But VW insists that it’s a real thing, so here we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6VX75"&gt;The company confirmed the change to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1499#images"&gt;the announcement was later published on Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt;. The larger Volkswagen Group (which sits over brands like Audi, Porsche, and others) will keep the Volkswagen name for its American division. The name change will officially take effect May 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9uMfTO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The name change will officially take effect May 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuLxzz"&gt;It’s not clear how the new name will be incorporated into the company’s upcoming slate of electric and gas-powered vehicles. For example, will it appear in any of the branding for the VW Atlas SUV, which typically gets 24 miles per gallon of gas? It seems doubtful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r18ZZb"&gt;“We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren’t changing is this brand’s commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,” said Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Voltswagen of America, in a statement. “The idea of a ‘people’s car’ is the very fabric of our being. We have said, from the beginning of our shift to an electric future, that we will build EVs for the millions, not just millionaires. This name change signifies a nod to our past as the peoples’ car and our firm belief that our future is in being the peoples’ electric car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64GkK4"&gt;The name change is by far the most outrageous move from Volkswagen to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;draw attention to its electric vehicle efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Others include Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/20/22240725/volkswagen-herbert-diess-twitter-elon-musk-vw-tesla"&gt;joining Twitter and letting a bit loose&lt;/a&gt;, a la Elon Musk, and the company’s recent “battery day” event, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;showed off the technology it’s developing&lt;/a&gt;. (Musk also authored a name change of his own recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo"&gt;taking on the title of “Technoking” at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcqPvW"&gt;But while the company is pouring tons of money into this push into EVs, there is currently only one long-range electric Volkswagen for sale in the United States: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video"&gt;the ID 4&lt;/a&gt; SUV. The US also currently lags behind China and Europe when it comes to overall EV sales, despite being home to Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF4We6"&gt;Voltswagen — sorry, Volkswagen isn’t the only legacy automaker leaning on groan-worthy puns or redesigned logos to emphasize its shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to ones powered by electrons. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;General Motors unveiled a new logo meant to evoke the shape of an electrical plug&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wFRdw"&gt;We’re still waiting on the news that Ford is changing its name to the atomic symbol for Lithium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google celebrates the unblocking of the Suez Canal with a small boat parade in search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Xinhua/Ahmed Gomaa via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKWLsu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/25/22350300/suez-canal-ship-stuck-ever-given-boat-stuck"&gt;The big boat&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356465/suez-canal-big-boat-ever-given-stuck-unstuck"&gt;no longer stuck&lt;/a&gt;. After days of rapt attention from the internet, a non-metaphorical rising tide has indeed lifted all the boats — and particularly, the Evergreen Marine Corporation’s Ever Given cargo ship — reopening the Suez Canal to regular shipping traffic and ensuring that the precious lifeblood of capitalism can continue to flow freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MqrGft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I shed a single happy tear for the big boat","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356465/suez-canal-big-boat-ever-given-stuck-unstuck"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wcDcrF"&gt;Naturally, Google is celebrating this simultaneously momentous and absurd moment in human history the only way it knows how: an Easter egg in Google searches for the phrases “Suez Canal” and “Ever Given” that show a tiny parade of cute lil’ emoji boats marching across your screen, just like the (much bigger) boats that can now (less cutely, one presumes) float their way through the aforementioned canal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zK2KGgtqGRJ9uNuugbqO1F0fJW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407705/boat.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AtBTh7"&gt;There’s probably a larger metaphor to be made about the flow of information on the internet that Google search facilities and the similarly unrepressed flotilla of real-world cargo now making its way through the canal, if you really wanted to. Or you can just enjoy the fun emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUHReB"&gt;Float on, little boats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Resizable BAR frame rate boosts now available on all 30-series GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NK44W7DaatMN8xxvfwqn484YYU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048041/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OCbGQm"&gt;Nvidia is launching Resizable BAR support today, a feature of PCI Express that can boost frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. Resizable BAR works by unlocking access to the full graphics frame buffer, instead of limiting it to 256MB block reads. This can improve frame rates in games, but it will require a compatible CPU, motherboard BIOS update, and even a VBIOS update for all 30-series desktop GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDe6aF"&gt;Nvidia has been working with both AMD and Intel to provide chipset support. AMD’s Zen 3 CPUs are supported, alongside Intel’s 10th Gen processors and the company’s new 11th Gen desktop chips that launch today. You can find &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgeforce-rtx-30-series-resizable-bar-support%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22357980%2Fnvidia-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus-available-now" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s full FAQ on motherboard and VBIOS updates right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzYFZh"&gt;Resizable BAR works the same as AMD’s Smart Access Memory, which also promises to improve frame rates in certain games by up to 10 percent. The frame rate increase using both will really depend on the game, and resolution will also impact how much performance will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fInGao"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;new RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; was the first to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302679/nvidia-rtx-3060-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus"&gt;include Resizable BAR last month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-resizable-bar-tested-with-evga-rtx-3060-xc-black/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wccftech &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that it improved performance between 4 and 11 percent in certain games. Nvidia initially limited support to fewer than 10 games, as the company warned enabling it on all games might result in performance decreases in some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DTOkH"&gt;Nvidia is now pre-testing titles and using special game profiles to enable Resizable BAR only where the performance increases. That means that only 17 games are currently supported, including &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion. &lt;/em&gt;More games will be added in future driver updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PN76oF"&gt;Resizable BAR support on the AMD side has been tested thoroughly, and &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2178-amd-smart-access-memory/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechSpot &lt;/em&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that some games making use of Smart Access Memory could see a nearly 20 percent boost at 1440p and 4K.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s dinosaur eggs have hatched, and now raptors roam the island</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cLDCVwqdd3Pvj_zgAS6wqHPdic=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048016/Ext9ydQW8AETyig.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/FortniteBRFeed/status/1376832532172398601" target="_blank"&gt;Fortnite News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4SOxO"&gt;The newest season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;dubbed “Primal,”&lt;/a&gt; did two main things: it introduced animals to the island and added a prehistoric theme. So it’s only fitting that the latest update includes a dinosaur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK67q9"&gt;Thanks to a recent patch, raptors now roam the battle royale game, joining other predators like wolves and sharks. They appear to spawn at random, however, so there’s no guarantee you’ll encounter one in a match; I played for more than an hour this morning before I spotted one in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pXlLZX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KgCPVN"&gt;In traditional &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fashion, the news had been teased over the last few days; giant eggs scattered across the island began to crack, hinting that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; was in the works. It was reminiscent of previous events like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525410/fortnite-volcano-eruption-season-9-alien-runes-spaceship-loot-lake"&gt;the volcano eruption&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin the rolling cube, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20691016/fortnite-robot-mech-season-10-countdown-kaiju-monster-patch-940"&gt;the time a massive robot was slowly constructed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s all part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;the game’s unique approach to storytelling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AevYI3"&gt;This is the first major update for season 6, so there could be other creatures on the way as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zqf8s1BA__I3V10P5ytyiwHAX_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406522/Fortnite_20210329165502.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 11th Gen Core i9 processor boosts Microsoft Flight Simulator by 20 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgCgSyJxWiUIsyQzK7DdLIWe-lA=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047970/intelcorei9_11900K_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Intel delivers a speed boost and PCIe 4.0&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EnDGaS"&gt;I built a new gaming PC in September to play new games like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. I figured that picking Intel’s Core i9-10900K and Nvidia’s RTX 3090 would make this machine last for years and offer top tier performance in demanding titles like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. I was wrong. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a notorious beast of a game and is quickly becoming the new &lt;em&gt;Crysis &lt;/em&gt;test for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKZ5ER"&gt;It has struggled to run smoothly above 30fps with all settings maxed out at 1440p on my PC, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;AMD’s Intel-beating Ryzen 9 5950X&lt;/a&gt; only improved the situation slightly for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aEXza"&gt;Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor arrives with a big promise of up to 19 percent IPC (instructions per cycle) improvements over the existing i9-10900K, and more specifically the lure of 14 percent more performance at 1080p in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; with high settings. This piqued my curiosity, so I’ve been testing the i9-11900K over the past few days to see what it can offer for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UzxkC"&gt;It’s less than a year after the i9-10900K release, and I’m already considering upgrading to Intel’s new i9-11900K because I’ve found it boosts &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4td3oPFclFVU8HrC0dgiUwB_8_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407556/intelcorei9_11900K_2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fl32l2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t typically review processors, so we don’t own dedicated hardware testing rigs or multiple CPUs and systems to offer all of the benchmarks and comparisons you’d typically find in CPU reviews. For those, we’re going to recommend you visit the excellent folks at &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/leo-waldock/intel-core-i9-11900k-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JW6ezT"&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-11900K ships with eight cores, 16 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz. On paper, that sounds like it would be less powerful than the 10900K with its 10 cores, 20 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, but the reality is far more complicated thanks to how games and apps are designed. Most of &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; currently runs in a main thread that’s often limited by how well your CPU can run single-threaded applications and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jhmwDG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10419674"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNPoqR"&gt;So in recent years Intel has managed to stay on top with its single-threaded performance, despite AMD offering more cores. That was until AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X managed to beat the final Intel performance advantage late last year. Intel’s new 11th Gen chips are trying to reclaim its traditional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1CgKD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a good example of where Intel typically has an advantage. It’s also an increasingly rare example of a game that’s very sensitive to your entire system components and not just how good your GPU is at rendering games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDPhrmvWPvKMfg19eXP2K3EY4eA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407557/705ff7fe_2f40_4e85_a2fd_b17a854aee38.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;em&gt; is a demanding title on PC.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="L89LfM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10419610"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4YXju"&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K does its job well enough here to boost performance by around 20 percent depending on resolution. I’ve tested a variety of flights taking off from different airports and flying over some of the world’s most beautiful locations and the most demanding cities the game has to offer. Everything feels smoother with Intel’s latest chips, but the results aren’t dramatic enough to get me beyond 60fps without stepping some settings down. A flight over Seattle with all the settings maxed out shows a 24-percent performance improvement with the new 11th Gen Core i9 at 1080p and an 18-percent increase at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Loo0e0"&gt;On my i9-10900K PC, I saw average frame rates of 38fps at 1440p and 33fps at 1080p. The Core i9-11900K managed to bump these to 45fps average at 1440p and 41fps average at 1080p. Averages during a particular benchmark don’t always tell the whole story, though. Over the hours I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve noticed the game dip and stutter less than before. It’s still not perfect, but it’s certainly smoother overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQb8jl"&gt;If I dial the game back to high settings, it immediately jumps to a 66fps average at 1440p — demonstrating just how much the ultra settings hit frame rates. I can personally barely notice the difference between high and ultra settings in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;so the boost here is noticeable thanks to the smoother gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAxDG"&gt;I also tested &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;and the Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5 benchmarks. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; saw a tiny bump of around 3 percent at both 1080p and 1440p, while the i9-11900K managed some impressive single core performance gains in both Cinebench and Geekbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xOQgPv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10419602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ8W7P"&gt;I should note I was also hoping to do most of my testing with my existing Z490 motherboard, but that didn’t go to plan. I swapped the chip in with the latest BIOS update for 11th Gen processors and found that the system rebooted a few minutes into games without even a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). I wasn’t able to troubleshoot it fully in time for review, but the Asus Maximus XIII Hero (Z590) board supplied by Intel worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXgm4G"&gt;You should be able to easily use 11th Gen processors with Z490 motherboards, as most manufacturers have already issued BIOS updates to support Intel’s latest processors. Some will even support M.2 NVMe storage using PCIe 4.0 with these latest chips, while others like Asus only support PCIe 4.0 on the Primary PCIe x16 slot with 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ywp8M4"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen processors finally deliver PCIe 4.0 support, and that’s good news for storage. Manufacturers have started to fully support PCIe 4.0 drives in recent months, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507807/western-digital-wd-first-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssds-sn850"&gt;Western Digital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, GigaByte, and MSI all launching high-speed drives. If you have a compatible PCIe 4.0 NVMe drive, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will certainly be worth it. I’ve managed read speeds of 6729MB/s and write speeds of 5206MB/s using Western Digital’s new SN850 1TB drive. Corsair’s MP600 also manages 4987MB/s read and 4259MB/s write speeds. Using Intel’s older 10th Gen chip, the Corsair drive managed 3484MB/s reads and 3235MB/s writes, so an 11th Gen upgrade improved speeds by more than 40 percent. If you work with a lot of files every day, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will be worth it for PCIe 4.0 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JD0BzaEMSVfes6_0gQATqsY1B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407569/xF0EPe6.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s SN850 has super fast PCIe 4.0 speeds with Intel’s 11th Gen processors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="12kbsp"&gt;I don’t think the Core i9-11900K does enough for me personally to upgrade from a 10900K, but the PCIe 4.0 support would tempt me more if I needed the speeds there. At $550 (if you can find it at this retail price), the Core i9-11900K sits in between AMD’s offerings, being less expensive than the top 5950X and 5900X Ryzen 9 chips and $90 more than the 5800X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9HgZj"&gt;There’s some solid single-thread performance here, and the 11900K and AMD’s 5900X and 5950X all trade blows depending on the games. Intel’s performance improvement will come at a cost of energy efficiency, though. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that the 11900K “sets the new high power mark” in several of its power tests, drawing over 200 watts in the same test that AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X drew 116 watts. If you even need a new CPU, it’s worth considering just how much Intel’s latest chips will influence your energy bills and the games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWfCyt"&gt;Whether you decide to upgrade to Intel’s 11th Gen or one of AMD’s chips will probably depend on the games you play and stock availability. A lot of games do a bad job of utilizing multiple cores on CPUs, mostly because console gaming hardware hasn’t offered solid CPU performance and spreading multiple rendering and physics threads across different cores can complicate game design. Intel’s new chips do a better job of handling these single threads to improve performance, but it’s very game-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCEapG"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, the general consensus is that the game desperately needs to be moved to DirectX 12 for improvements to multi-core CPU performance. But Intel’s IPC improvements have managed to help until the Direct X 12 update arrives with the Xbox Series X release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF8rmK"&gt;Where Intel might have an advantage over AMD here is availability of chips. It has been increasingly difficult to find AMD’s latest Ryzen processors in recent months, thanks to a global chip shortage. Intel partners have already been accidentally selling some 11th Gen desktop CPUs, which may indicate it will have a steadier supply in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="p7mm3d"&gt;The winner between Intel and AMD will be the company that can get these chips into the hands of PC gamers eager to upgrade. Much like the GPU market right now, benchmarks don’t matter when the best chip is often the only one you can actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo and Aurora team up on fully autonomous trucks for North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlp-AJbU554P6qwA9s7J3QVRRKg=/105x0:1155x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047931/Volvo_Blog_Cover_1260x700__Rendering_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FZ20LC"&gt;Volvo is partnering with self-driving startup Aurora on a new lineup of fully autonomous semi trucks, the companies announced. The trucks will be deployed in North America on highly frequented hub-to-hub routes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv07Rk"&gt;The deal between Volvo Autonomous Solutions and Aurora — which was founded by former executives from Google, Tesla, and Uber — is a “long-term partnership spanning several years,” the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E1pOuy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“long-term partnership spanning several years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dke6G2"&gt;It’s also the latest partnership between a major OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and an autonomous technology startup, as the industry continues to slowly inch toward a future with more fully driverless passenger vehicles and trucks on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vV8jKv"&gt;Aurora has been testing its “Aurora Driver” hardware and software stack in its test &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331418/aurora-self-driving-cars-semi-truck-av-texas-robotaxi"&gt;fleet of minivans and Class 8 trucks in the Dallas-Fort Worth area&lt;/a&gt; since last year. Unlike its rivals, which are largely focused on robotaxi applications, the company has said that its first commercial service will be in trucking “where the market is largest today, the unit economics are best, and the level of service requirements is most accommodating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrIYdA"&gt;“Creating a viable autonomous on-highway offering requires close partnerships with both customers and tech partners to develop the needed capabilities,” says Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, in a statement. “This exciting partnership brings our goal of transport as a service an important step closer and will accelerate our commercial offer for hub-to-hub applications in North America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJYEz3"&gt;To date, Aurora has raised $690 million in funding, and co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson has been hailed as the &lt;a href="https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-aurora-a-safe-path-to-scale-autonomous-vehicles-bd0680fa4fe0"&gt;“Henry Ford of autonomous vehicles,”&lt;/a&gt; thanks to his work helping to pioneer Google’s self-driving car initiative. His co-founders are Sterling Anderson, who helped lead Tesla’s Model X project, and Drew Bagnell, who ran a research lab at Carnegie Mellon then left to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber. Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai, and EV startup &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/aurora-will-power-byton-evs-autonomous-driving-features/"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt; are also Aurora customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE0qcl"&gt;The company raised half a billion dollars last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215575/amazon-innovation-self-driving-car-startup-google-tesla-executives"&gt;in a funding round led by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;It also acquired Uber’s autonomous division&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274640/toyota-aurora-denso-self-driving-car-robotaxi"&gt;teamed up with Toyota and Denso&lt;/a&gt; to develop a fleet of robotaxis, with the first hitting the road by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COZdPd"&gt;Volvo, which is the second largest manufacturer of heavy duty semi trucks, has been gradually adding more partially autonomous features in its trucks but has yet to strike a deal to build fully driverless delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHg0Fz"&gt;Long-haul trucking is likely to be one of the first broad applications of automated driving technologies. Indeed, there are widespread fears in the trucking industry that autonomous technology will lead to enormous displacement among truck drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSX7Le"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/managing-transition-driverless-road-freight-transport"&gt;A 2017 study&lt;/a&gt; found that automated trucks could reduce the demand for drivers by as much as 50 to 70 percent in the US and Europe by 2030, with 4.4 million of the 6.4 million professional drivers on both continents rendered obsolete. These fears are heightened as tech companies introduce eye-catching, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923232/einride-tpod-self-driving-truck-sweden-logan"&gt;cabin-less prototypes&lt;/a&gt; designed to cut the driver completely out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJFOAM"&gt;There’s been a flurry of partnerships and other corporate deals in recent years in the nascent driverless trucking industry, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic casts doubt on the long-term viability of using autonomous vehicles for passenger transportation. Established players like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt;Daimler said they would be joining forces with Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, while newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310209/tusimple-self-driving-truck-network-ups-xpress-penske"&gt;TuSimple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/self-driving-truck-startup-ike-raises-52-million/"&gt;Ike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2019/09/25/self-driving-startup-embark-raises-70-million-opens-freight-hubs-for-robot-big-rigs/"&gt;Embark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/plusai-autonomous-truck-completes-coast-to-coast-delivery-in-3-days/568729/"&gt;Plus.ai&lt;/a&gt; are also working toward fully driverless trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s latest Starship landing attempt ends in destruction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIcoSbK0opim4b1NokJ3N-NF4uo=/45x0:2745x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047925/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_9.06.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the last visuals from SpaceX’s SN11 before it exploded. | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKsTXN"&gt;Another Starship prototype exploded Tuesday morning during an attempt to nail a tricky landing technique at SpaceX’s test launch facilities in Texas. The landing attempt followed a clean liftoff and a demonstration of the rocket’s autonomous in-flight maneuvers, marking SpaceX’s fourth high-altitude flight since December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2NXnH"&gt;The SN11 rocket launched at 9AM ET in foggy weather at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities, soaring roughly 6.2 miles to test the rocket’s three Raptor engines and a number of in-flight maneuvers that steer it back to land. As SN11 neared peak altitude, the engines gradually shut down to begin its free-fall back toward the ground before executing a “landing burn” — when one Raptor reignites to carry the rocket gently down to a landing pad not far from where it launched. At least, that’s the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9pJvn"&gt;“Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted shortly after the explosion. “Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dpcm92"&gt;A live camera feed aboard SN11, streamed by SpaceX, froze moments before its landing attempt. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDL-ZMRHYrE"&gt;Another feed&lt;/a&gt;, provided by the website NASA Spaceflight, showed large chunks of debris raining on SpaceX’s Boca Chica facilities, though the landing explosion itself was obscured by fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JTKHCN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Final view of SN11 in the air:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;➡️&lt;a href="https://t.co/Q2p3q1HS0i"&gt;https://t.co/Q2p3q1HS0i&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/PNJta9svkA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PNJta9svkA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris B - NSF (@NASASpaceflight) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight/status/1376885901847113731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ntGXpJ"&gt;“Looks like we had another exciting test,” SpaceX’s John Insprucker said on SpaceX’s live stream, suggesting the vehicle was lost in another eventful landing attempt. “We do appear to have lost all the data from the vehicle, and the team of course is away from the landing pad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9vbcZ"&gt;“At least the crater is in the right place!,” Musk tweeted. One of SN11’s engines “had issues” during ascent and didn’t fire strongly enough during the landing burn, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbAWUo"&gt;While the fog ruined views of SN11’s landing attempt, a weather radar from the National Weather Service in Brownsville, Texas detected a plume of gas that indicated an explosion in mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfbenP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If anyone on South Padre Island, or in the Boca Chica area, Port Isabel, Laguna Vista, etc received an abrupt and startling wakeup this morning, this was probably it. Our radar was able to see &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SN11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SN11&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately explode in mid-air. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RGVwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RGVwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/txwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#txwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ohyyq3bIpf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ohyyq3bIpf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NWS Brownsville (@NWSBrownsville) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBrownsville/status/1376891946346676227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021 announced as online-only event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4iHHOJmM_ffEj6TupX83HJTEmo=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047863/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9obnno"&gt;Apple just announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will take place on June 7th through June 11th this year, and that like last year it will be an online-only event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDK3Ak"&gt;The announcement, as is typical for Apple, is opaque when it comes to details, but there might be a tantalizing hint: is the memoji character’s glasses simply showing a reflection from their laptop? Or could Apple finally be gearing up to announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;long-rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt; or AR glasses?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPkLeT"&gt;“We are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of worldwide developer relations, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PHK6V"&gt;WWDC is when Apple typically details changes coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS with the occasional hardware surprise. Last year, it also dedicated a significant portion of its keynote to announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Mac lineup’s transition to its own Apple Silicon&lt;/a&gt; processors. With this transition still underway, it seems likely that Apple will have an update to share about its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz8B8y"&gt;New hardware tends to be less of a focus at the developer conference, but it’s not unheard of. Apple used WWDC 2019 as its venue to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646424/apple-mac-pro-redesign-new-specs-features-photos-wwdc-2019"&gt;announce the new Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and at WWDC 2017 it announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732144/apple-homepod-speaker-announced-siri-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;HomePod smart speaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/5/15740298/new-apple-imacs-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;updated iMac desktops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732350/new-apple-ipad-announced-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxhVo"&gt;It’s not surprising that Apple has opted to make its global conference for developers online-only given that the impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world. Facebook’s F8 developer conference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346432/facebook-f8-conference-2021-date-virtual-event-sign-up"&gt;will be virtual this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con and the 2021 Anime Expo&lt;/a&gt; have also confirmed that their physical events will not take place. But some organizations are attempting to make limited physical events happen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;like Mobile World Congress in Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQvr7t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPUrEP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flying taxi startup Lilium goes public via SPAC, unveils its new electric aircraft </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/soVYzhQkIbfTDxBXy5-YwvC8Z_E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047853/lilium_jet_7_seat_render_04.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4twj9d"&gt;Germany’s Lilium will be the latest electric aviation startup to go public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. Lilium will merge with Qell Acquisition, a SPAC founded by former General Motors executive Barry Engle. The newly formed company will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LILM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZOUex"&gt;As part of the announcement, Lilium unveiled a new, seven-seat electric aircraft that it says will launch as part of an inter-city flying taxi service in 2025. Previously, the company’s prototype was said to have only five seats — so we can assume that Lilium’s ambitions to ferry more passengers are growing along with its financial expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWLPsM"&gt;It’s the latest deal involving an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startup after the SPAC deals of &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/archer-to-go-public-through-merger-deal-with-spac-atlas-crest-receives-1-billion-order-from-united-airlines-2021-02-10"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;Joby Aviation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;A SPAC is a blank-check corporation&lt;/a&gt;, formed as an alternative to an IPO, because it raises funds for an operation that doesn’t have revenue of its own. There have been a rash of SPAC deals involving companies in the transportation space, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/car-sensor-startup-aeye-goes-public-in-2-billion-spac-deal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/micro-mobility-startup-helbiz-to-go-public-via-a-spac-and-will-expand-into-ghost-kitchens/"&gt;micromobility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p4epoW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the latest deal involving an electric vertical takeoff and landing startup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7atVeS"&gt;Lilium’s SPAC deal values the combined company at a pro forma enterprise value of $2.4 billion and an approximately $3.3 billion pro forma equity value. After the merger is finalized, Lilium is expected to receive approximately $830 million from the deal, including $450 million from a fully committed common stock PIPE offering and $380 million cash held in trust. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, at which point the company will start trading on the Nasdaq exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkK3z6"&gt;Engle, a longtime executive vice president and president of GM’s North America division, will join the board of the newly formed company, as well as former Airbus CEO Tom Enders. Engle described Lilium’s product as “a highly engineered aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKHkRX"&gt;The type of aircraft Lilium is developing is typically called a “flying car,” electric-powered, able to carry only a handful of passengers, and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. These types of vehicles are still in their prototype phase and have yet to be rolled out for commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAuIUF"&gt;The company completed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18625088/lilium-jet-test-flight-electric-aircraft-flying-car"&gt;first phase of testing&lt;/a&gt; of its five-seater 36-rotor electric prototype in October 2019, with the aircraft hitting speeds of 100km/h (62mph). Lilium says it remains “on track” to launch passenger operations in several locations around the world by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hlUSdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new seven-seater jet has a projected cruise speed of 175mph&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UeWrd"&gt;The new seven-seater jet has a projected cruise speed of 175mph at 10,000 feet and a range of 155 miles. That’s slower and with less range than the company’s projections for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18625088/lilium-jet-test-flight-electric-aircraft-flying-car"&gt;five-seater jet&lt;/a&gt;, which Lilium said would have a top speed of 186mph and a range of 186 miles. Still, the company says it is the “culmination of five years of technology development across four generations of technology demonstrators, including Lilium’s full-scale 5-Seater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIxKeF"&gt;Lilium applied for certification with the US Federal Aviation Administration in 2018, which typically can take several years to complete. The company has also applied with Europe’s EASA for certification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evaJTe"&gt;Of course, many companies — Lilium included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, had to reorganize &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/12/01/inside-larry-pages-kitty-hawk-returned-deposits-battery-fires-boeing-cora/#c6e934858ab4"&gt;amid reports&lt;/a&gt; about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits. Another startup, Zunum, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612702/zunum-aero-sues-boeing-fraud-hybrid-electric-jet"&gt;locked in a bitter legal fight&lt;/a&gt; with its former investor, Boeing. And last year, Germany’s Lilium Jet had a &lt;a href="https://evtol.com/news/lilium-evtol-catches-fire/"&gt;prototype catch fire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RWoOQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
