    <title>A new Matrix Resurrections trailer is all about change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-X1-fMVDra6Rr0MIQUb-NaStnA=/345x0:1568x815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216933/trinity_melting.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgYs_NDyaLs&amp;amp;t=42s" target="_blank"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Muw3RG"&gt;Let’s get something out of the way: this is &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; and if there is any movie we are going to cover the shit out of, it’s &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections &lt;/em&gt;— even if its new trailer is long on melting / morphing faces and short on clues about the plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQC179"&gt;The latest trailer, titled “Déjà Vu,” opens with a voiceover from Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) with a line from the first movie, when she explains that “déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.” That sentence repeats several times. We see a black cat cross Neo’s path just like in the first movie, and we see a series of screen wipes, moving between younger and older versions of characters, including Neo — in the birthing goo pod — Trinity, Morpheus (hi, Laurence Fishburne!), Agent Smith, The Merovingian, and others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhpKVJ"&gt;Like the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22640826/matrix-4-trailer-resurrections-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; trailer released in September&lt;/a&gt;, we hear Jefferson Airplane’s &lt;em&gt;White Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; playing in the background (there is no &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SocialKimLy/status/1435964170483093508?s=20"&gt;rubber duck&lt;/a&gt; in this latest clip, unfortunately). In case you didn’t pick up on the theme, the trailer helpfully shows the word CHANGE, while hearing a voice question, “Why use old code to make something new?” and another observe that “maybe this isn’t the story we think it is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWZ4P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s managing editor encouraged me to blog my feelings about this latest trailer, even though I warned her the feelings would be mostly “lust and also more lust” because look, I am Gen X, and Keanu Reeves is our mascot, and I feel compelled to protect and respect him at all costs even in the worst of movies. This film looks like a fine use of his cheekbones and soulful brown eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8G92z"&gt;And this trailer probably should have been the first one released for &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; because it reminds you of how much we missed the black leather-clad, hair-gelled&lt;em&gt; Matrix&lt;/em&gt; crew while hinting at a whole new direction. This is slightly off-topic, but it is sort of nice to see a few crows’ feet around Neo’s eyes as he looks around, bewildered, at the Matrix — much the way I expect most of Gen X would regard it were we ever to be unplugged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJalD3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on December 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB11d0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Frances Haugen is kicking Congress into gear on 230 reform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Whistleblower Frances Haugen Testifies At Senate Hearing On Big Tech" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0Kq3VQjUzTmRP0kI5ZgIAt15nA=/0x1:6978x4653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216804/1356609708.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L6tl5o"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified for the second time before Congress on Wednesday. But instead of explaining Facebook’s harms, Haugen provided guidance on how to fix the problems the platform created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sps4TG"&gt;Specifically, House lawmakers on &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-holding-big-tech-accountable-targeted-reforms-to-techs-legal"&gt;the Energy and Commerce Committee&lt;/a&gt; requested Haugen’s input on a slew of recently introduced measures to reform tech’s controversial legal liability shield under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Both Republicans and Democrats have a stake in the game, but their deep divides over what kind of online content should stay up or down has stalled any chance of pushing reforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGar0j"&gt;But House Democrats are more optimistic now than ever in their abilities to clamp down on hate speech and harmful content. In an interview on Wednesday, Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) said that Congress’ work to regulate tech was largely paused due to its work in passing President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. “We had to deal with infrastructure,” Malinowski said. “Today’s hearing is a signal that the 230 reform will likely be on our agenda through next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qcwhty"&gt;&lt;q&gt;House Democrats are more optimistic now than ever in their abilities to clamp down on hate speech &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36Dq5s"&gt;Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) echoed Malinowski’s enthusiasm in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/01/can-congress-unite-section-230-reform-this-top-democrat-has-hope/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “The fact that this has been discussed and debated and [we’ve] had hearings ad nauseam and Congress has not acted is not acceptable to me,” Doyle said. “So my goal at this hearing is to start moving legislation forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR3jWo"&gt;Wednesday’s hearing paired its high-profile witness, Haugen, with four Democratic proposals to change Section 230. These bills, like Malinowski’s Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act, provide more targeted changes to the law than many of the proposals that come before them — mainly in their focus on algorithmic amplification of harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKMQbB"&gt;“There’s a growing realization that the algorithms are the problem,” Malinowski told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview on Wednesday. “Through their recommendation algorithms, the social media companies have created a perfect machine for driving people to political extremes and even to violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8oDHO"&gt;Committee leaders, including Doyle and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), are betting on a bipartisan outrage over algorithms to help them pass moderation reform over the next few months. In his opening remarks, Doyle pointed out that Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA), the top Republican on the subcommittee, issued a discussion draft that would remove platform immunity for amplification earlier this year. Without Republican support, any 230 reforms would likely be dead in the water when passed off to the Senate, and its razor thin Democratic majority, for approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKapFS"&gt;“There’s a bipartisan desire to reform the courts’ interpretation of Section 230,” Doyle said on Wednesday. “And the American public wants to see us get things done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDlMcj"&gt;Still, some civil rights activists fear that any changes to Section 230, including those targeting algorithmic amplification, could cause more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kLipF"&gt;“We don’t want to chill amplification that is benign or beneficial, but also don’t want to prevent accountability when platforms’ actions cause harm even in the absence of personalized recommendations, or outside of carve-outs for important subjects like civil rights,” Matt Wood, Free Press Action vice president and general counsel, said at Wednesday’s hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AF2aFj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Congress needs to do its due diligence and legislate responsibly. Lives are at stake.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQf8t6"&gt;Other activists fear Congress may be moving too fast and without properly considering the consequences for vulnerable communities when they last changed the law. After Trump signed SESTA / FOSTA in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17188772/trump-sesta-fosta-bill-switter-sex-workers-mastodon"&gt;sex workers were forced off websites&lt;/a&gt; like Backpage.com where they screened clients, despite the bill’s stated purpose to combat sex-trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYOgtM"&gt;“It’s irresponsible and unconscionable for lawmakers to rush toward further changes to Section 230 while actively ignoring human rights experts and the communities that were most impacted by the last major change to Section 230,” said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future. “The last misguided legislation that changed Section 230 got people killed. Congress needs to do its due diligence and legislate responsibly. Lives are at stake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYRyUk"&gt;The committee plans to hold a second hearing next week as it ramps up its efforts to pass meaningful reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey’s Square is changing its name to Block</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMMz1WsssE0ZT9hIYYMRqVFl6Z8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216769/Block_lockup_reverse_black_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Block’s new logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Block&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iiP503"&gt;Square, a financial services company co-founded by now-former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is changing its name to Block, the company announced Wednesday. Square has grown beyond just offering financial services — it took a majority stake in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;music streaming service Tidal&lt;/a&gt; this year, for example — which Block is using as the justification for the new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5O7iR"&gt;“The change to Block acknowledges the company’s growth,” the company said &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/52543725/en"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Since its start in 2009, the company has added Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 as businesses, and the name change creates room for further growth. Block is an overarching ecosystem of many businesses united by their purpose of economic empowerment, and serves many people—individuals, artists, fans, developers, and sellers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ErY9wW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Block is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Square?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CashApp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spiralbtc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@spiralbtc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TIDAL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TBD54566975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TBD54566975&lt;/a&gt;, and our foundational teams who support them. We’re here to build simple tools to increase access to the economy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CkVKxHPkqy"&gt;https://t.co/CkVKxHPkqy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RMOnxCLP9Y"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RMOnxCLP9Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Block (@blocks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blocks/status/1466154290137894912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0qavbe"&gt;Block says there will be no organizational changes as a result of the new name, though the company’s Square Crypto initiative is being rebranded to Spiral. The new Block name is expected to legally go into effect “on or about” December 10th. Its ticker symbol, SQ, will “not change at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZC3NYI"&gt;The changes are being announced just two days after Dorsey, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617551/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-unite-country-world-peace-cryptocurrency"&gt;a noted Bitcoin enthusiast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;resigned as CEO of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, he had served as the CEO of both Twitter and Square simultaneously. He remains the CEO of Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY7d5K"&gt;The new Block name arrives just over a month after Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;changed its name to Meta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s new RTX 2060 12GB graphics card is coming to quell shortages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qp0LNsB1xk-mnQHnJ-zAoU1oPA=/0x0:2076x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216706/rtx_2060_desktop_nvidia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiling the RTX 2060 graphics card in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JY8x3p"&gt;In February 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;Nvidia committed to reissuing some of its older GPUs&lt;/a&gt; — namely the RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti — to give gamers a couple of low-cost options that scalpers or crypto miners (hopefully) won’t see much use for during the chip shortage. The company is following through on at least part of that promise by releasing a new variant of the RTX 2060 that has 12GB of video RAM, doubling the memory of the standard configuration originally released in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ0yXd"&gt;Nvidia says that various models should become available starting Tuesday, December 7th. The specs for revised Founders Edition GPU are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2Frtx-2060%2F%23specs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22812618%2Fnvidia-new-rtx-2060-12gb-vram-graphics-card-gpu-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available right here&lt;/a&gt;. Note the slightly higher base clock speed and the slightly increased CUDA cores (2,176 versus 1,920 in the standard RTX 2060). Its specs looks similar to the RTX 2060 Super in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vayu9e"&gt;Nvidia didn’t share a starting cost for the 12GB RTX 2060 Founders Edition, though it told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “it is a premium version of the RTX 2060 6GB and we expect the price to reflect that.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18171616/nvidia-rtx-2060-gpu-349-ray-tracing-budget-entry-level-ces-2019"&gt;The RTX 2060 6GB launched in 2019 for $349&lt;/a&gt;. It also shared that OEMs will be making their own custom versions of the 12GB RTX 2060. We’ll update this post once we hear back about pricing info for various models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRfOsm"&gt;Having this card is great for people who’ve felt the burn of GPU restocks not going their way and who don’t want to give in to paying ridiculously high prices in the secondary market for cards that shouldn’t cost that much in the first place. The RTX 2060 won’t be great for running games with ray-traced graphics (despite it being capable of the feature), but with its power, most games should run well on medium graphical settings at 1080p resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nH5bSF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The true price of a PS5 or GPU, November 2021 edition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KeI0FG"&gt;The PC market is one of many areas that has felt the sting of the chip shortage, spurred by the global pandemic. Things like graphics cards and consoles are still in high demand, despite no longer being new to market. And with many of the RTX 30-series GPUs already costing a premium at retail, it has become tough to buy what you want, and to do so at a normal price. Many retailers are zeroed out of stock completely, and bots and eagle-eyed shoppers (most of whom hope to flip the products for a profit) will likely beat you to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ButCo0"&gt;I’m skeptical that Nvidia releasing one entry-level (at this point) GPU can help to reverse the tide of the price-surged secondary market. But I’m definitely happy that it’s trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUEU0n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s terrible year in review is giving me serious Spotify Wrapped FOMO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxXlbpT5wvDkYX9-p0DnxQGOA20=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216672/PR_2021_TopArtist_B_1_2048x1152.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EO66Nl"&gt;It’s December 1st, which for Spotify users, means the annual tradition of the music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android%5D"&gt;streaming service’s Spotify Wrapped roundup&lt;/a&gt;: customized, flashy infographics of the top songs, playlists, artists, and podcast that you’ve listened to over the last year, chock-full of data, mood boards, and just a sprinkling of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VswuKS"&gt;I, unfortunately, do not use Spotify. Instead, I pay Apple $10 per month for Apple Music, Spotify’s biggest competitor. And so while virtually everyone I know on Twitter and Instagram is spending the entirety of today putting their personal taste in music on blast, I get... a playlist of the songs that I listened to the most this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WEfbNO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify Wrapped 2021 is here to take over your social media","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86vZG15pgepbcvNaYWnWuNc_pyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055670/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_11.20.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pnZduy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997218/spotify-wrapped-year-end-decade-review-apple-music-streaming-audio-service"&gt;Spotify has been eating Apple’s lunch&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; now with Wrapped, which has practically become its own internet holiday each year. And yet, it took Apple four full years to even launch its bare-bones Replay feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963520/apple-music-replay-listening-history-view-share-albums-songs"&gt;which debuted in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and hasn’t been meaningfully updated since. (I’ve been using kludged together Smart Playlists on iTunes for years to try to poorly replicate the Spotify experience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l76p7F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify beats Apple at its own game with its Wrapped year in review feature","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997218/spotify-wrapped-year-end-decade-review-apple-music-streaming-audio-service"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="t3X0QJ"&gt;2021 is no exception, with Spotify offering what feels like its most lavish recaps yet. My wife (who is a Spotify user) spent the morning showing off her bespoke playlist to me, which included (among other things) specially curated songs for specific moods, rankings of where she placed among global Doja Cat listeners, a color-changing “audio aura,” and an interactive quiz. All of it is designed to be shared and shown off on other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OALJLqwI2guTQOxG3P5H6-lbCVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055820/jepg.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My wife’s far cooler Spotify Wrapped recap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v1QqJA"&gt;And it’s not just music listeners, either. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doddleoddle/status/1466096651869863966"&gt;Artists seem&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AVABandOfficial/status/1466085854925836290"&gt;love Spotify Wrapped, too&lt;/a&gt;, with their own customized recaps showing off how many millions of times their fans streamed their music around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoJRg6"&gt;It’s not that Apple Music couldn’t do its own version of Wrapped; Apple certainly has the data, and I find it extremely hard to believe that the $2.79 trillion company can’t find the space in its budget to task a team of designers and engineers into building a similar tool. Or maybe it could try to buy Last.fm, which already does a whole bunch of music trends based on customers’ listening habits, if it wanted to offload some of that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opMASI"&gt;And there are plenty of reasons for Apple to do exactly that &lt;em&gt;besides&lt;/em&gt; my annual dose of social media FOMO: Apple has made no secret of its ambitions for recurring service revenue to serve as a key part of its future going forward. And yet, instead of jumping on the easy marketing win and massive user goodwill that a more robust replay feature could offer, year after year after year, Apple just chooses to do the absolute bare minimum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Tmtzi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ah yes, Spotify Wrapped day, or as I like to think of it “punishment for being an Apple Music user while everyone else gets to have fun with their music recaps” day.&lt;/p&gt;— Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cgartenberg/status/1466073033462923267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w2OUY0"&gt;Look at it another way: Spotify, every year, manages to get millions of people to spend days posting algorithmically generated Spotify advertisements to every corner of their social media presences, without even offering any free giveaways or incentives. Why &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; Apple Music be trying to get a piece of that action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EFxX8U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Since I'm an Apple Music user, you please just imagine my Spotify Wrapped to be whatever artists you think cool people listen to&lt;/p&gt;— Monica Chin (@mcsquared96) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mcsquared96/status/1466080039070539780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwoUym"&gt;It’s not even like Apple has to worry about angering Spotify by shamelessly ripping off one of its most popular features: Spotify &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; thinks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;Apple is a “ruthless bully”&lt;/a&gt; that monopolizes the App Store to favor its own services and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;has filed an antitrust complaint in the EU&lt;/a&gt; to that end. It’s not like there’s a good, healthy corporate relationship to ruin here. If Instagram could shamelessly copy stories from Snapchat, Apple can figure out how to replicate its own version of Wrapped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKvUUn"&gt;In fact, it’s increasingly surprising year after year that seemingly no one is copying Spotify’s absurdly popular data visualizations. With a few exceptions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798429/xbox-museum-20th-anniversary-stats-achievements"&gt;Microsoft’s recent 20th anniversary Xbox retrospective&lt;/a&gt;, there are still virtually no takers on following Spotify’s lead here. Where’s Netflix’s flashy look back at the shows you binged over the year, or PlayStation’s deep dive into how many hours you spent trying to beat Pride and Joy Prototype in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;? The closest comparison I can think of is Goodreads’ “Your Year In Books,” which also functions more as a straight list than the comprehensive experience that Spotify has created here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liJQX9"&gt;But for now, I’m once again spending December filled with envy as my Spotify-using friends get to show off all their favorite songs, left hoping with increasingly futile optimism that maybe Apple Music will figure things out next. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD Global backs out of Nokia 9 PureView Android 11 upgrade, blames camera system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nokia 9 PureView" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OgDw6J8vmWJnNazmzV-cxiM1vRg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216530/bfarsace_190210_3229_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia 9 PureView was launched in 2019 with a rare five-camera system.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tcIFwQ"&gt;HMD Global is not only reneging on its promise to bring Android 11 to the Nokia 9 PureView, but it is also dangling a discount for a new phone at customers who just found out their current devices are no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RboZRa"&gt;These are customers who paid between $599 and $699 for the premium Nokia 9 PureView back in 2019 after it made quite a splash with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/24/18234962/nokia-9-pureview-cameras-5-features-specs-multiple-price-release-date-photos-hands-on-mwc-2019"&gt;quintuple rear camera array at World Mobile Congress&lt;/a&gt; that year. At the time, Nokia was even known as the best phone brand for receiving fast software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844444/android-updates-still-take-forever-study-says"&gt;according to Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;, so customers understandably might have felt they could trust Nokia and HMD Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD1C0N"&gt;As one of the devices in the &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_in/one/"&gt;Android One program&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokia 9 PureView runs a near-stock version of Android 9 and is supposed to get at least two years of OS upgrades and three years of security updates. Although the phone got upgraded to Android 10 in December 2019, it has not received any other OS updates since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHL5As"&gt;HMD Global said it is unable to update the Nokia 9 PureView with Android 11 because “[i]ncompatibilities between the camera and the software would have led to a compromised experience that does not meet our high standards,“ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_us%2Fnokia-9-upgrade&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811988%2Fhmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to its statement&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps because its quintuple cameras were co-developed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/12/21289574/light-camera-company-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;Light, the camera company that has quit smartphone photography&lt;/a&gt;, HMD Global just cannot overcome this technical challenge. That said, the company said the phone will continue to receive security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uImLeyLTb-iHesU6EO6GZjGjQEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14130617/bfarsace_190213_3229_0067.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HMD blames the 9 PureView’s unique camera array for being unable to update it to Android 11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iGvNKt"&gt;Rather than let current owners trade in their now-unsupported devices, HMD Global comes across as trying to profit on those affected customers by asking them to buy a new Nokia phone. “[F]or those of you looking to make the jump to Android 11,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_us%2Fnokia-9-upgrade&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811988%2Fhmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to its website for Nokia 9 PureView owners&lt;/a&gt;, “we’re offering a 50% discount on Nokia XR20, or another device depending on regional availability.” First of all, the midrange &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_us%2Fnokia-xr-20%3Fsku%3DVMA750D9FI1CN0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F1%2F22811988%2Fhmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia XR 20&lt;/a&gt; is hardly a substitute for the premium Nokia 9 PureView, and you need to jump through some hoops just to get that discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VE7U5O"&gt;At a time when Android phone makers are trying to differentiate themselves by modeling after Apple’s four-year-plus software support for iPhones, cases like HMD Global backpedaling on the Nokia 9 PureView’s update just remind us not to take these promises too seriously. Bigger companies like Samsung might have more resources to deliver on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt; for its huge portfolio of devices, but smaller outfits like HMD Global and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/motorola-software-updates-rant/"&gt;Motorola just don’t have a good track record&lt;/a&gt;. While software support is something to consider when making a phone buying decision — especially when we’re holding onto our phones longer between upgrade cycles — it should not be &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;deciding factor for an Android because it just might not happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwO2fv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmzOZe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook removes block on searches for Kyle Rittenhouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Found Not Guilty In Kenosha Protest Shootings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZBa8z29Tc5k-QA_UoOUdR408lQ=/187x0:5103x3277/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216479/1236665464.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kyle Rittenhouse can rejoin Facebook if he wants, after being acquitted of murder charges in November. | Photo by Sean Krajacic - Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lWnTO7"&gt;Facebook on Wednesday removed a block on searches for the name Kyle Rittenhouse that it had put into place following his arrest for an August 2020 shooting in Wisconsin that left two people dead and a third seriously injured. Last month, a jury in Kenosha acquitted Rittenhouse on all charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUH9SW"&gt;In the days following the shooting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404518/facebook-search-kyle-rittenhouse-blocked-kenosha-shooting"&gt;the company removed Rittenhouse’s profile&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook and Instagram and blocked users from creating new profiles using his name, to prevent copycats from spreading misinformation. By the end of that week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404518/facebook-search-kyle-rittenhouse-blocked-kenosha-shooting"&gt;Facebook was blocking searches for “Kyle Rittenhouse&lt;/a&gt;,” as well as removing expressions of praise or support for him on the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qE1uhZ"&gt;“After the verdict in Kenosha we rolled back the restrictions we had in place that limited search results from returning content related to key terms including Kyle Rittenhouse,” Sally Aldous, spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“While we will still remove content that celebrates the death of the individuals killed in Kenosha, we will no longer remove content containing praise or support of Rittenhouse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr9P6k"&gt;The changes were rolled out in the days following the verdict, Aldous said. “Given the granularity of these policies as well as the wide public interest in these events, we anticipate enforcement at scale will be especially challenging,” she said, adding that Rittenhouse himself does not currently have any accounts on Meta’s platforms — which include Facebook and Instagram — but in theory he would now be able to rejoin them. Like all users, however, he would be subject to the company’s community standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCoNQf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otg4Bf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQyMz1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFNEhb"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor 60 announced in China with vlogging-focused gesture controls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uW00EkpePKhkR1gC7X0Eem4Tkd0=/0x1:5999x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216451/HONOR_60_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honor 60 series.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Honor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DIHeSZ"&gt;Honor, the former Huawei sub-brand that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;split from the Chinese tech giant last year&lt;/a&gt;, has announced its latest handsets for the Chinese market. The Honor 60 and Honor 60 Pro are two midrange handsets powered by Qualcomm’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740748/qualcomm-snapdragon-695-778-plus-480-680-5g-4g-smartphone-chips"&gt;Snapdragon 778G Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise, they’re very similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536512/honor-50-series-pro-release-date-news-features-google-mobile-services-apps-play-store"&gt;Honor 50 series phones&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year, right down to having similar dual-ring camera bumps on the rear of each phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ythUCQ"&gt;A notable new feature for both new phones is support for hand gesture controls, which let you perform actions like making the “Okay” gesture or raising your hand to perform camera controls like switching between its front and back cameras, or enabling picture-in-picture mode. The phone can recognize five hand gestures in total, and Honor says features like these make vlogging “easier than ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pfNLCL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Releasing in China on December 10th&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlilDF"&gt;Honor is far from the first smartphone company to have added hand gestures like these, with everyone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20907715/google-pixel-4-motion-sense-gesture-controls-radar-sensor-project-soli-demo-features"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/how-to-use-palm-gesture-to-take-selfie-on-samsung-mobile-device/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301982/lg-g8-thinq-review-android-phone-snapdragon-855-6-gb-ram-z-camera-sensor"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; having experimented with similar features. These controls tended to be laggy and inexact in the past, so Honor’s tech has a lot to prove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKJIeD"&gt;Both phones have triple rear camera setups for when you get filming. On the 60 Pro, there’s a 108-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel combined ultrawide and macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The big improvement here is with the ultrawide, which was only 8 megapixels on the 50 Pro. The 60 Pro also has a high resolution 50-megapixel selfie camera. Meanwhile, the regular Honor 60 has a lower resolution 32-megapixel front-facing camera, triple rear cameras with a lower resolution 8-megapixel ultrawide, and no mention of macro photography capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KBeyi"&gt;Both phones have 120Hz curved OLED displays, though the 60 Pro’s is slightly bigger (at 6.78 inches) and curves around all four sides of the device, &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_60_pro_arrives_with_snapdragon_778g_50mp_ultra_wide_cam_honor_60_gets_a_larger_120hz_display-news-52093.php"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the Honor 60 has a 6.67-inch display that curves around its left and right sides. Internally, both phones have 4,800mAh batteries, a small increase from the 4,000 and 4,300mAh batteries found in the 50 Pro and 50. Both charge at a maximum of 66W, which is in line with the Honor 50, but a slight downgrade from the Honor 50 Pro’s 100W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQEXKc"&gt;Honor has yet to confirm a global launch for the phones, but it’s worth noting that if either phone were to release outside of China, they’d be able to come preinstalled with Google’s apps and services, just like the Honor 50. Huawei, meanwhile, is still subject to US sanctions that prevent it from shipping phones with Google’s proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kJAgh"&gt;The Honor 60 series has only been announced for the Chinese market so far, with no confirmed plans for a global launch. But there was only a matter of months between the launch of the Honor 50 in China and its release in the rest of the world, so we shouldn’t have too long to wait if there’s a global release coming. In China, both phones will be available on December 10th. The Honor 60 will start at ¥2,699 (around $424), while &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; notes the Honor 60 Pro starts at ¥3,700 (around $581). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech’s first generation of founders starts to step aside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Bezos’s India Visit Marked By Probe and Protests" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_R7fyPRCD47GK1go_CdRw566v4=/0x0:2138x1425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70214184/1193819818.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JC8jKS"&gt;Massive tech companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and more have had a huge impact on the way we live our lives, and have had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;incredible levels&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/"&gt;financial success&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing many of these companies have in common is that their founders are no longer necessarily in control; they’ve either stepped down, started sharing power with others, or in some cases possibly even been pushed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hAI6N"&gt;This week alone, Twitter co-founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;became a &lt;em&gt;co&lt;/em&gt;-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1EMUxc"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; — Jack Ma stepped down as CEO of the giant Chinese tech company in 2013, and retired from his position as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/tech/jack-ma-retire-alibaba/index.html"&gt;executive chairman in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. At the time he still had a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/alibaba-jack-ma-retire.html"&gt;considerable amount of power in the company&lt;/a&gt;, but after a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/ant-s-record-ipo-remains-in-limbo-a-year-after-china-crackdown?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;stalled IPO for the division he was in charge of&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/billionaire-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-reappears-hong-kong-sources-2021-10-12/"&gt;disagreements with the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt;, it’s hard to say how much power he still holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EujqeX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon &lt;/strong&gt;— In July 2021, Jeff Bezos officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;handed the CEO position of Amazon over&lt;/a&gt; to former Amazon Web Services head Andy Jassy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LI0HDf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apple &lt;/strong&gt;— Tim Cook was &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/01/14Apple-Media-Advisory/"&gt;temporarily left in charge of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 while Steve Jobs underwent medical treatment. Jobs returned to the company, but then put Cook in charge for another leave of absence in 2011, before permanently making him CEO later that year. Around the time of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;his 10-year anniversary as CEO of Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, Tim Cook said he doesn’t intend to run the company for another decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="03YCHp"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ByteDance — &lt;/strong&gt;Zhang Yiming, founder of the company that owns TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445212/tiktok-bytedance-ceo-zhang-yiming-steps-down"&gt;announced he’d be stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; this May. In an internal letter, he said he worried about “relying too much on the ideas I had before starting the company.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nPcfNv"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; — In August 2015, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20994361/google-alphabet-larry-page-sergey-brin-sundar-pichai-co-founders-ceo-timeline"&gt;moved on to overseeing Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, the holding company for Google’s disparate properties. The shakeup was seen as them taking their hands off the search engine company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9128083/sundar-pichai-ceo-google-larry-page-sergey-brin"&gt;leaving Sundar Pichai in charge&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20994218/google-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-larry-page-sergey-brin-step-down-control-management"&gt;Pichai took over as CEO of Alphabet as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="geIrqO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Instagram &lt;/strong&gt;— In September 2018, Instagram’s co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they were stepping down, reportedly after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking"&gt;major disagreements with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8zbaph"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft &lt;/strong&gt;— Microsoft founder Bill Gates’ departure happened in many stages, with him first stepping down as CEO in 2000, then leaving his full time position at the company he helped found in 2008, and finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;stepping down from his position on the board last year&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is currently being run by Satya Nadella, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537683/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-chairman-bill-gates-john-thompson"&gt;acts as both CEO and chairman of the board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="boWSkR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Netflix&lt;/strong&gt; — In July 2020, Ted Sarandos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327550/netflix-ted-sarandos-ceo-netflix-reed-hastings-board-member-originals-tv-movies"&gt;joined Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings as co-CEO&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that Sarandos was already helping lead (he’d been &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/outside-the-box-2"&gt;with the company for twenty years&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/co-ceos-are-out-of-style-why-is-netflix-resurrecting-the-management-model-11594987416"&gt;was in charge of its original programming&lt;/a&gt;), and that him joining Hastings as CEO was just a formalization of his role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sw7urw"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Salesforce&lt;/strong&gt; — Bret Taylor, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;replaced Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; as Twitter’s chairman of the board on Monday, is also becoming the co-CEO of enterprise tech giant Salesforce, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/salesforce-promotes-bret-taylor-to-co-ceo.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not the first time Marc Benioff, the company’s CEO and founder, will be sharing power, but it’s another instance of a former deputy starting to gain more power within a tech giant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UUkvbR"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Twitter &lt;/strong&gt;— On Monday, November 29th, Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;announced he was leaving Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and said “I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrn2YB"&gt;It’s probably worth noting that all of the founders listed above were men, and were replaced by men, which isn’t a great trend. There are a few notable women in power — Meta’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. As of this writing, neither has indicated whether they plan to depart their posts any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld7HAA"&gt;There are, of course, exceptions to the trend. The most notable is Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s complete control over Meta. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t have plans to give up his job, and it’d be pretty much impossible for shareholders to force him out, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/opinion/tech-dual-class-stock.html"&gt;thanks to the company’s stock structure&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from Zuckerberg, a couple of other CEOs come to mind: Jensen Huang is still in charge of Nvidia (until it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-faked-part-of-a-press-conference-with-a-cgi-ceo/"&gt;replaces him with a digital AI avatar&lt;/a&gt;), Tencent co-founder Ma Huateng still acts as CEO and chairman of the company, and Snapchat is still helmed by Evan Spiegel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjaxxe"&gt;Obviously, tech companies can survive and thrive without their founders — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; are the two most valuable public companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EA086j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated December 1st, 3:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; — Added information about Tencent and Alibaba, and about female leaders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon teams up with B&amp;O on pricey Android TV soundbars for cord-cutters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="closeup of right side of a soundbar shaped like a semicircle and focused on the Verizon checkmark logo pasted on" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RioqNkeMzYPUNeCERxTg7hfrgBk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216361/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_10.01.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verizon logo can return to your living room and you’re technically still a cord-cutter ($399 Verizon Stream TV Soundbar shown) | Image: Inside Verizon YouTube Channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SdIWv0"&gt;Verizon already sells accessories like phone cases and chargers, but in addition to electronics like digital picture frames and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22736065/tcl-tab-pro-5g-verizon-mmwave-tablet-device"&gt;tablets&lt;/a&gt;, there are also... &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/onesearch/search?q=sound%20bars&amp;amp;ES=MobileAccessories&amp;amp;src=wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;soundbars&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-bang-and-olufsen-soundbars-stream-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s releasing two new soundbars with a built-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572099/verizon-stream-tv-box-android-google-assistant-updated-lost-remote-feature"&gt;Verizon Stream TV&lt;/a&gt; streaming box. The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/verizon-stream-tv-soundbar/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99&lt;/a&gt; Stream TV Soundbar and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/verizon-stream-tv-soundbar-pro/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999.99&lt;/a&gt; Stream TV Soundbar Pro are both built by Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen, with the Pro model sporting a similar housing to the even more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/3/20847593/bang-olufsen-beosound-stage-speaker-sound-bar-expensive-design"&gt;Beosound Stage&lt;/a&gt;, but with nine drivers inside instead of 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ip9I5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q77kORvl9g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBLGFJ"&gt;The concept of a soundbar with streaming hardware hidden inside is nothing new, as Roku,  JBL, and others have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848492/roku-smart-soundbar-wireless-subwoofer-speakers-tv-setup-ifa-2019"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20885361/jbl-link-bar-review-soundbar-android-tv-google-assistant-price-specs-features"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the clutter in your entertainment center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtnPco"&gt;Since Verizon’s Stream TV system is a skinned Android TV that includes Verizon’s services, it also touts Google Assistant and all the streaming services you can name: HBO Max, Netflix, Disney Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. Verizon normally only allows TV subscribers access to the Stream TV box, but with these new soundbars, you don’t need to be a Verizon subscriber to check it out — making it pretty cord-cutter friendly (though you will need to register with Verizon to use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgM3Bj"&gt;Both of the soundbars stream 4K content, output virtual Dolby Atmos sound, and support HDMI 2.1 with multiple inputs — two on the cheaper model and three on the Pro. Both also feature Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi 6, and Chromecast, but the Airplay 2 support that the Beosound Stage includes is not available here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_0V1YYxIGDrxHwjGBmSXnISv_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055853/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_12.15.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soundbars can be discounted right now up to 40 percent if stacked with four “eligible” accessories that are $20 or more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gCOcxN"&gt;If you choose to accept the post-cable living room that Verizon is building, then you can order the new soundbars today. Verizon also has a promotion to save 30 to 40 percent off items like these soundbars if you purchase three, four, or five eligible accessories that are more than $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXzmmc"&gt;I added both of the new Verizon soundbars (other brands were ineligible for the promotion) and three Verizon phone charging accessories and got the prices of the Stream TV soundbars down to $239.99 for the cheaper one and $599.99 for the Pro. It’s an unusual route to a home theater upgrade and still more expensive than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493125/tcl-alto-soundbar-9-plus-8i-6-plus-3-bluetooth-airplay-google-assistant-dolby-atmos-surround-sound"&gt;the cheapest Atmos-compatible one-piece audio solutions&lt;/a&gt;. But it could be a way to add Dolby Atmos sound processing and reduce clutter in the living room while restocking on phone chargers all at once. It might also be a good deal for TV subscribers turning into cord-cutters... Verizon doesn’t seem to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
