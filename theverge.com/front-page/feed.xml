    <title>Nintendo finally improved the Switch’s kickstand with new OLED model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch with OLED screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVPvE0bawN5D8CHSDtJ65brXKJs=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69545867/newswitch_kickstand.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TPIRf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;Nintendo’s new Switch with an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; seems promising for people who’ve wanted a bigger, more vibrant display to play games. That’s worth getting excited about (despite the apparent lack of spec improvements inside), but I’m just as pleased that Nintendo revised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/5/16602556/nintendo-switch-kickstand-problems-bad"&gt;the truly horrible kickstand present in the original Switch&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the flimsy, fragile stand that’s prone to wobbling (or breaking if you’re unlucky), the new one takes a page from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets&lt;/a&gt; — and seems a lot better for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1tOL8"&gt;Looking at the new Switch console’s backside, the kickstand is much wider, extending across the entire bottom part of the tablet to better support its weight. Nintendo’s announcement video shows the improved kickstand supporting custom adjustments, which should give you more ways to comfortably use it. Another nice touch is the slot in the middle of the kickstand to allow a USB-C cable to route through so you can charge as you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrZbcJ"&gt;There are several multiplayer and single-player games releasing this year on the Switch that’ll benefit from this improved kickstand. At E3 2021, Nintendo announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535183/mario-party-superstars-warioware-nintendo-direct-e3"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WarioWare &lt;/em&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; as well as a remaster of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535127/advance-wars-1-and-2-re-boot-camp-nintendo-direct-e3-2021"&gt;first two &lt;em&gt;Advance War&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also releasing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread &lt;/em&gt;on October 8th&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— the same day that the Switch with OLED is launching&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ca3b9J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why it took Nintendo 15 years to make Metroid Dread","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22536783/metroid-dread-yoshio-sakamoto-nintendo-switch-e3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRdziV-_0kw9qRKu9e5XnBRiMzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701294/newswitchstand.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee8Osc"&gt;Despite being almost five years old, the original Switch hardware has endured because it’s clever and well-built and because it relies upon standards like USB-C and microSD. The fiddly kickstand was a glaring misstep, and it’s great to see that Nintendo has reworked it in the new OLED version. I’m not suggesting that it’s worth upgrading to this new $349.99 console just because of the kickstand, but it’ll certainly sweeten the deal if you usually use the Switch in portable model or could see yourself doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7orVx6"&gt;It’d be ideal if Nintendo’s learnings trickled down to the less expensive model, mostly because an improved kickstand would be a really strange feature to reserve for its most premium console. Perhaps we’ll hear more about it as we get closer to its October 8th release date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Must-play Nintendo Switch games are almost half off</title>

  &lt;p id="7mXjnd"&gt;Nintendo finally announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;Switch with an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; that comes out in October, but right now, GameStop is hosting a big one-day discount on two must-have Switch games: &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fsuper-mario-odyssey%2F10141908.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%2F10173345.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each game is going for $35 (usually $60) for the physical or digital versions, and if you have the means, I suggest getting both. &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is the latest (delightful) installment in the long-running &lt;em&gt;Mario &lt;/em&gt;3D platforming franchise, while &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt; has strategic, turn-based battles interspersed with team- and friend-building elements you’d usually find in a &lt;em&gt;Persona &lt;/em&gt;game.&lt;/p&gt;

This includes &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745447681886164303" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745447707512658431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745447735818166267" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745447694322641805" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745447721030442198" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zbJnEU"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo keeps falling in price. Woot is hosting the best deal — by far — right now on the AT&amp;amp;T-locked version of the two-screened device in new condition. &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-dual-screen-lte-tablets-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The base model with 128GB of storage costs just $410&lt;/a&gt;, while doubling the storage space bumps the price up to $510. It still might be a little ridiculous to invest in this phone since Microsoft hasn’t delivered any major updates recently, but at least you won’t have to pay as much as early adopters did to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5CJCVK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10517551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="aMdK3A"&gt;
&lt;p id="v8HQPY"&gt;Last week’s excellent deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-14367655?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F9dch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell G15 Ryzen Edition for $1,078&lt;/a&gt; (usually $1,458) is still happening. You can head over to Dell to get this deal on a capable but affordable gaming laptop that has a 15.6-inch 1080p display with a 165Hz refresh rate, with AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, and Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics chip. It has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage (both of which can be upgraded after purchase). One caveat, though, is that shipping is currently scheduled for early August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8fBYGF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634452"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sn3m6"&gt;The OnePlus 9 has received its first big price cut. Usually $729, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $649 now&lt;/a&gt;. As my colleague Allison Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564077/oneplus-9-pro-sale-price-screen-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, you won’t be missing much by not opting for the more expensive 9 Pro. The 9 and 9 Pro share the same processor, a 120Hz refresh rate display, and a great 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, though, the 9 has slower wireless charging, and a plastic build instead of aluminum. The OnePlus 9 can work via 4G and 5G on Verizon and T-Mobile, but just 4G with AT&amp;amp;T’s network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch OLED model will go on sale October 8th for $350</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rnbcl26DzcTOxNGWUH94bHhpcpY=/84x0:1047x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69545212/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_9.05.23_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4BoEkW"&gt;Nintendo is &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/"&gt;announcing a new Switch model today&lt;/a&gt; with a larger 7-inch 720p OLED display. While rumors had suggested this new Switch would ship with a new Nvidia chip inside, it doesn’t look like that’s the case. Nintendo lists this Switch OLED model as only supporting 1080p via TV mode, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors had suggested 4K support&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a rumored Nvidia chip upgrade. The Switch OLED model will go on sale for $350 starting on October 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6Q7bQ"&gt;Other than the new screen, this revised model includes an adjustable stand for tabletop play, 64GB of built-in storage (up from 32GB), a new dock with a wired ethernet port built in, and improved audio for handheld or tabletop play. Nintendo only mentions “up to 1080p via HDMI in TV mode” for the TV dock, so the rumored 4K mode isn’t part of this OLED Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eb9NnZ6sbwlMvSD0LSpf1ibfDus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701105/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo’s new OLED Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SEdJ4P"&gt;There’s little else changed over the original, though. Nintendo says battery life on this new OLED Switch will be up to nine hours, the same amount as the current Switch. This OLED Switch is slightly longer than the original and also slightly heavier at 0.71 pounds (0.32kg) versus the 0.66-pound (0.29kg) weight of the original Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wwYJXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Must-play Nintendo Switch games are almost half off","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/6/22564848/nintendo-switch-games-sale-mario-smash-animal-crossing-microsoft-surface-duo-deal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YZzjAc"&gt;Original Joy-Cons will all work with this new Switch, and all existing games will run on this new OLED model. Nintendo is also offering both black and white units when the Switch OLED model ships later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMLNHf"&gt;This updated Switch has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;rumored heavily&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, and Nintendo has chosen to reveal it well after the company’s E3 show that focused exclusively on new Switch games. Reports had suggested this new Switch would appear before E3 began last month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTkDCPlOwWyTyW3JtKMWOAqJfgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701153/switcholeddock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Switch dock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fjgez4"&gt;The new Switch arrives nearly two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date%5D"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller and cheaper version of the Switch that you can’t hook up to a TV. The Switch Lite debuted at $199 in September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aROu5i"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch has sold incredibly well, with the console &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;dominating US sales charts&lt;/a&gt; for nearly two years straight. Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;lifetime sales are at 84.59 million&lt;/a&gt; units shipped since its launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14237060/nintendo-switch-console-launch-date-price-announced"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a figure that is getting closer to the Wii console’s 101.63 million lifetime sales mark. This updated Switch model is bound to only help push sales even closer to the Wii.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rep. Ken Buck is the new face of Republican antitrust</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvvADHQsCpRnBsMa6yonMWghE5Y=/0x1:2039x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69545202/lswall_210630_4654_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Meet the Republican behind the House’s bipartisan antitrust deal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XvYWU2"&gt;In Congress, pretty much everything moves at a glacial pace. But legislation targeting the market power of large tech companies is picking up an unusual amount of bipartisan momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JNGHV"&gt;After nearly two years of investigations into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, the House Judiciary Committee pushed through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a package of six bills&lt;/a&gt; last month that would force these companies to unwind anti-competitive mergers and make the data they obtain on users more portable, in an effort to spur greater competition in the market. The package was surprising in its size and scope, but even more surprising — it was bipartisan. Colorado Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, played a large role in building that coalition, which has put him at the leading edge of Republican tech policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjrWFV"&gt;On June 30th, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; met with Buck in his office on Capitol Hill for a brief interview in between House floor votes. We discussed last month’s markup, the congressman’s relationship with the rest of the Republican caucus, and how he’s “very lonely” up in his office where tech lobbyists purportedly refuse to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm1YJC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfSQyV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your initial reaction to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last month’s markup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XMdxT"&gt;Tired, tired. Twenty-nine hours was a lot of time. I thought there were some really good ideas. And as I said from the beginning, this is a starting point and this is how the legislative process should work. We did an 18-month investigation. We drafted bills. We floated them to members. We filed them. They were available to members. In fact, I sent them to all the Republican members on the committee. And then we moved forward with a process with people who had different ideas. I thought it was a very positive process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKj3Sh"&gt;Some of the ideas were just poison pills that were designed to cause division, but most of the ideas proposed in amendments were really positive, and those bills will change again before they hit the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZG0up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last year, you authored your “Third Way” report detailing the ways in which you disagreed with the majority’s solutions. Can you describe your evolution from authoring that report to supporting the Democrat-led measures last month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O6ctc"&gt;The bills we presented take a scalpel to the issues that are necessary. What we’re trying to do is slow the monopolization of these four companies in the marketplace to encourage competition. We required the burden to flip on mergers which would slow down the growth of these companies, but at the same time we talk about portability and other things that would encourage competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TrtKPpBqhWqMIGjjIEuKPEW4Sy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695909/lswall_210630_4654_0021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SIKTpk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking back from the investigation and pushing for this effort to be bipartisan, what were those conversations with members like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q7jqc"&gt;My evolution from the very beginning was that the market will take care of this. Throughout the investigation, I saw how these companies are acting. I was very concerned and I realized we need to do something. But we don’t want to have the unintended consequence of shutting down the economy and hurting airlines and banks and all the other sectors that do have competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6BEwL"&gt;I think the bills are consistent with the Third Way report. But I also said, I’m opposed to overturning the American Express case. I pointed out some areas that I thought were bad policy in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOiyGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We heard from Speaker Pelosi that she supports the measures and wants to move forward. But a couple days later, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said that they need more work. How long do you see this process taking and what needs to get done to prepare these bills for the floor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DfsCd"&gt;We take the ideas from the members in the markup. We work on the bills and probably after the August recess, we send the bills out to members again. And those will be managers’ amendments that will move forward with the floor vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3kDPQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the markup, we saw some California Democrats oppose the bills over privacy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap7cCW"&gt;And the California Republicans, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umnyaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you think privacy has a place in these bills?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCgCNO"&gt;Yes. The Section 230 censorship issues are under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The issue of privacy, I think in some areas, is in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The way to encourage privacy is to have competition in the marketplace and allow competitors like DuckDuckGo to say they won’t sell our data and you can choose to use that search engine. Or you can use Google’s search engine, and on page 23 of their user agreement, you can agree to allow them to sell your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwOwsh"&gt;The consumers will demand that privacy be taken into account, and some of them don’t care. Some of them do, but the marketplace will address these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIKOMt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sounds like you agree that privacy is a competition issue. How do you include language in these bills to implement stronger privacy protections?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFrnbc"&gt;How do you implement that? That’s the problem. You don’t want government coming in and saying this kind of speech is not something that you can sell. There is cybersecurity privacy, where we absolutely want to protect from Russian hackers or whoever’s out there. But there’s also the privacy an individual decides to give up. That’s an individual right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="otQ2Am"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What Big Tech wants is to run the clock”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UaDkDY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve mentioned in the past that these bills are just the first step in taking on Big Tech. Many members of your caucus seem to disagree. I listened to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) try to force Section 230 reforms into these bills. How do you plan to meet these requests from other members as you move forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzRrqC"&gt;Section 230 is another committee and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) is working on that. I think that Jim has a lot of good ideas that I will support, but they just don’t belong in these bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fvgtb"&gt;The Democrats aren’t going to pass these 230 reforms. The Republicans who are opposed to these bills want to add it to the bill so the Dems don’t vote for it. And that’s not going to happen. What Big Tech wants is to run the clock. If they can get to the end of this Congress and if Republicans are in charge who don’t like these bills, these bills will never hit the floor. This is the opportunity to get this passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="888Azg"&gt;Jim has been a hero of mine for years, and I love the guy. We disagree about an issue. I don’t go to motive at all with Jim. I just think he and I see this issue differently. He’s been very respectful of me and in different groups that we’ve talked in and I try to be as respectful as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Congressman Ken Buck, R-Colo., at his office in the Rayburn Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5Cw7v2Q5MBwss7YmWyf3uDpKOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22695904/lswall_210630_4654_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NONIKO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see these moving forward in the Senate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIotLJ"&gt;The likelihood is that you get most Democrats and some Republicans to get over that 60-vote margin. I think there will be some Republican opposition in the Senate. I actually think the Senate works much better in terms of collegial communication than the House does. They’ll be working through these issues in a healthy way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnEmrz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you’re optimistic we’ll see these bills approved over the next few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMCMSD"&gt;I’m optimistic, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cAh7b2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m very lonely”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd5FAT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the lobbying effort been like with these big tech companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hE9Cvp"&gt;I hear secondhand what it’s like. Nobody bothers coming in and talking to me. I’m very lonely. I love interviews like this because the reality is that the Big Tech people know this is not a friendly forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Rg3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your take on the court throwing out the Federal Trade Commission’s complaint against Facebook last week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSwtov"&gt;It indicates that there is even greater need for the definition of market than there previously was. The judge said in the opinion that it’s easy to define what the tobacco market is. It’s harder to define what the Facebook market is. And the FTC hasn’t done that. So these bills have a definition in place that would address that very issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWM5UM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your opinion on Lina Khan? She’s already moving forward with an aggressive antitrust agenda as FTC chair, and the conservative commissioners seem to think she’s overreaching.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrZkCx"&gt;The challenge is she doesn’t have a voting record. It’s hard to identify her in any particular group, which is good and bad. I look forward to working with her. I’ve had conversations with her. I think she is supportive of what we’re trying to do here. I have stressed in conversations that it’s essential that the FTC work in a bipartisan manner to reinforce the bipartisanship that’s coming out of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj1pX7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the FTC and the Justice Department will be strong enough to take on these companies without this legislation being passed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="K6B6Ml"&gt;Updating laws that are more than 100 years old is really important. We have to amend the laws to appropriately address this issue. The lightbulb hadn’t even been invented when the Sherman Act was passed in 1888. To think that you can click on a computer screen and get something delivered the next day is completely different. The laws have to be updated in order for law enforcement to be effective. It’s a constitutional issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcYxiq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V489p8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s StudioCaddy is a home for all your Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rycBrR7aOwJrl9DuitSd79rka5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544950/DSCF7728_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy has USB-A and USB-C charging ports on the side.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwwjSr"&gt;Following the recent release of the StudioDock, an opulent stand that turns the iPad Pro into a mini desktop computer, Kensington is expanding its Apple-focused offerings today with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$179.99 StudioCaddy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an unusual product with a simple goal: it’s meant to be the place where all your Apple devices can live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnRsii"&gt;The StudioCaddy is comprised of two halves that attach magnetically. The first half is a basic metal stand that you can slot a closed MacBook into, and there’s also a rubberized shelf out front designed to hold an iPad. The second half attaches onto the front and includes two Qi wireless chargers, one vertical for an iPhone and one horizontal with a recess that you can put an AirPods case into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OaHm9J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hu7DlM"&gt;You could, of course, use the StudioCaddy with many combinations of Windows ultrabook, Android tablet and phone, and Qi-equipped wireless earbuds. Kensington is focusing on the Apple ecosystem, though — the product’s full name is actually “StudioCaddy with Qi Wireless Charging for Apple Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXi8ru"&gt;The StudioCaddy feels very well built, and each stand is sturdy enough not to get knocked around a desk. The wireless charging stand also has USB-C and USB-A ports for extra power, providing up to 20W over USB-C — enough to charge an iPad (but not a MacBook Pro) reasonably quickly, or even an Apple Watch if you want to complete the set. That’s useful, although the external AC adapter is a little bulkier than I’d prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcNyZH"&gt;While I’ve found many vertical Qi chargers don’t work with my iPhone 12 Mini, Kensington has included a swappable part that lifts the phone to raise its wireless charging coils to the right level. It’s also recommended for use with smaller phones like the iPhone SE or the 11 Pro, though I found various larger Android devices would also charge just fine with it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0k8GSB6lgerRCT9b2dvTboX7sQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700978/DSCF7727_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The StudioCaddy is designed to hold a MacBook and iPad while wirelessly charging an iPhone and AirPods.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HVa9ll"&gt;The main idea with the StudioCaddy is that you can save a lot of desk space by storing all your Apple devices in the same place. In practice, though, I’m not sure that people would need their iPhone charger to be attached to their laptop. Until recently I almost always used my MacBook Pro in “clamshell” mode on another stand, and I put it out of the way to save space, which the StudioCaddy does well. But I’d rather have the iPhone charging in front of me at my desk so I can see notifications coming in, so the benefit of the all-in-one approach is mostly lost on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh5KY6"&gt;If your desk setup allows it, which mine does not, it could be neat to put the StudioCaddy next to your monitor with your phone facing you and your MacBook in clamshell mode. That’s quite a lot of horizontal space to give up, however. You could also just use the StudioCaddy’s two halves independently of one another, and then you’d be left with a good wireless charger and a good MacBook/iPad stand. But there are lots of other options out there for both of those use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL3UUb"&gt;You know your own desk situation better than I do, and I can recommend the StudioCaddy if you think it’d be a decent fit. It’s a well-made, versatile product that does what it sets out to do, and most people with a lot of Apple devices could probably make good use out of it. It’s not cheap, though, so you’d have to be sure it was a better option for you than replicating all the functionality with separate products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAyPeN"&gt;The StudioCaddy will be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-StudioCaddy-Wireless-Charging-K59090WW/dp/B094Q4XNG7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to order&lt;/a&gt; from today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing’s debut earbuds will cost $99 and feature noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V-_Fwcx6eMrvtBfA8sllXcVU75g=/26x0:7655x5086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544930/Nothing_Design_Concept_1___UNDER_EMBARGO_UNTIL_11_AM_GMT_9_MARCH_2021__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A teaser image for the design of the earbuds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0OkmMN"&gt;Nothing’s debut earbuds, the Nothing Ear (1), will cost $99 / €99 / £99 and will feature active noise cancellation (ANC), the company’s founder Carl Pei has &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothings-ear-1-earbuds-will-feature-noise-cancelling-and-run-99/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each earbud will be equipped with three mics to enable ANC, the company says, and will be released initially in the UK, India, Europe, and North America following their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555247/nothing-ear-1-true-wireless-earbuds-july-27th-launch-oneplus-carl-pei"&gt;announcement on July 27th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pBs1G"&gt;Pei, who previously co-founded OnePlus, is using the Ear (1)’s noise cancellation to position the earbuds as a competitor to Apple’s $249 AirPods Pro. However noise cancellation is increasingly common on mid-range true wireless earbuds. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; cost $130, for example, while Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;second-generation Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; include ANC and start at $120. However, there are still plenty of earbuds without noise cancellation at this price point, like Google’s recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Pixel Buds A-Series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sI3vuI"&gt;Nothing’s founder also used the &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; interview to clarify why the company decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284363/nothing-company-essential-brand-acquisition-news"&gt;acquire the Essential brand&lt;/a&gt;. “[B]efore we were called Nothing, ‘Essential’ was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,” Pei told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “So that’s why we’ve acquired the trademark. We don’t have any plans to do anything with Essential.” The smartphone manufacturer, which was started by Android creator Andy Rubin after he left Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134985/essential-phone-shutting-down-andy-rubin-startup"&gt;shut down in early 2020&lt;/a&gt; after releasing just one phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfmp6q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wu5mlx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Echo Show 8 is a little faster and has a better camera</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Still the best Alexa smart display&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dU5SU5"&gt;Amazon’s midsize Echo Show 8 is the best smart display in its lineup. It is larger and more capable than the diminutive Echo Show 5, while costing far less than the larger Echo Show 10. The Echo Show 8 is handy for watching video, listening to music, getting weather reports, controlling smart home devices, making video calls, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFaRLc"&gt;So it’s no surprise that the second-generation model, which sells for $129.99 and is shipping this week, doesn’t rock the boat. It’s largely the same smart display as before but with slightly faster performance and an improved video calling camera. It has the same display, same design, same speaker system, and the same set of features as its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4AwORI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10594276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9foDKT"&gt;Improving the video calling capabilities makes sense, given how much video calling has been done while everyone was (and for large part, still is) stuck at home during the pandemic. The new Echo Show 8 borrows the 13-megapixel camera from the flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the pathetically low-resolution, mediocre 1-megapixel camera that was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;first gen&lt;/a&gt;. As before, there’s a mechanical privacy shutter you can slide in front of the camera to both disable it and block its view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GFPuIrlwrWFjeuL59lsgPIMdw0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641651/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 8 has the same camera as the Echo Show 10: a large, 13-megapixel sensor with automatic panning and cropping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xDKysBbp17RbY5_VoMsDnFGbhFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641652/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still block the camera’s view with a physical shutter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f0w6AJ"&gt;The improvements in video calls are immediately noticeable. You can use the Echo Show  for video calls to the Alexa app on phones or other Echo Show devices, or you can join Skype, Zoom, or Amazon’s Chime calls from it. In my testing with Zoom calls, the image is much sharper and more pleasant to look at, with better color and much more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBf38a"&gt;The Echo Show 8 doesn’t have the motorized base on the bigger Echo Show 10, but it still can automatically frame you and follow you around as you move thanks to its high resolution. The autoframing isn’t as good as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;new iPad Pro’s Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; feature, and it moves much slower and tends to constantly reframe itself, like you’re the star of a Ken Burns documentary. But the Echo Show is a $130 smart display, not an $800 tablet, so it’s hard to complain, so long as you stay relatively still during video calls. If you don’t want the camera to autoframe, you can say “Alexa follow off” to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhFFL-zRIKWvAcviDEhC60cM2Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641650/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Echo Show 8 for Zoom calls, but it works best for one-on-one calling, not groups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rz4Ew"&gt;That said, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. The new camera has a much wider-angle lens, which allows it to do those auto-framing tricks. But it can also cause the image to look distorted at times and isn’t always very flattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfgMMN"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s eight-inch display works fine for one-on-one video calls, but it’s too small to comfortably use for a group call. If you are on a call where someone is sharing a screen, it’s hard to see what’s happening, and while you can view messages posted to a chat, you can’t type any out yourself on the Echo Show’s display. Joining Zoom calls can be done entirely by voice, but it’s much easier to call up the Zoom app on the Echo Show by saying “Alexa, open Zoom” and then typing in a meeting code or starting one yourself from the touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKlC5v"&gt;I also observed an echo of my own voice in several Zoom calls, both with individuals and group calls, which made it hard to use the Echo Show for anything work related. Other parties on the line also said there was an annoying echo of my voice whenever I unmuted my mic. I reached out to the company about this issue and Amazon was able to fix it with a software update after the original publish date of this review. I tested the Zoom calling after the update was released and did not observe the echo again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aC0UQ6"&gt;The new processor in the second-gen Echo Show 8 does make the smart display respond quicker to taps and swipes than its predecessor. It’s not a huge difference, and Amazon’s software still has a long way to go to make it more useful via touch, but when compared side by side, the new one opens menus and screens quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1mSQJrmHJidSIt94JnUkKT_arM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641646/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wedge-shaped design houses two speaker drivers that put out impressive volume for its size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jrpnisdCEE4OSmDMq8WggNLXg74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641644/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon ditched the 3.5mm output jack on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DQ08q"&gt;Elsewhere, the changes are either nonexistent or very minor. The wedge-shaped design is exactly the same; you can still get it in the same white or black color options as before. (Annoyingly, both colors come with a white power cord.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWd2k2"&gt;The display has the same 1280 x 800 pixel resolution, but now it can adjust its color and white balance to the lighting in the room. Like the new processor, the difference isn’t huge, but the new model is slightly warmer and more pleasant to look at when the adaptive color setting is enabled. I’m still more impressed by the ability of Google’s Nest Hub to mimic the look of a printed photo by adapting its color to the lighting in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aOILp"&gt;The dual-driver speaker system is unchanged and it’s as loud and full sounding as the first gen. The Echo Show 8 can fill a small room with sound surprisingly well, and its bass response is better than expected. At times, it might even sound &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bassy, but you can adjust the EQ in the Alexa app easily enough to compensate for that. Unfortunately, Amazon dropped the 3.5mm output jack on the back of the new model, so it’s not possible to hook it up to a larger speaker system with a wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JFRm2"&gt;You can watch Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix on the Echo Show, but Disney Plus, Peacock, HBO Max, and many other streaming services aren’t available. YouTube is available through the Echo Show’s Silk browser, but it’s not as seamless of an experience as available on Google’s Nest Hub, and you can’t easily cast videos from your phone to the Show’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M6IUZ"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s software is the same as what debuted on the Echo Show 10 earlier this year. Amazon is starting to make better use of the display, with split screens that show weather data alongside news, but it still feels very much like a voice-first device. Though the new Echo Show 8 is faster, it’s still a chore to tap through all of the screens to get to the smart home controls, and managing what shows up in the rotating information screens on the display requires a lot of menu diving and trial and error to get what you want. (And even then, you’ll still probably get nagged about new Alexa Skills or other Amazon promotions you don’t care about.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jt6A-bmN6YU57lqXDW6lw4AYY3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641647/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Managing what shows up on the displays when it’s not being used is a chore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFdANYL11-bM-MdfsbZdGMJXxwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641648/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 8 is noticeably faster when responding to touch input.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlERf4"&gt;There are of course many, many other things you can do with an Echo Show smart display — far too many to cover in the scope of this review. The things that I find it most useful for are weather reports, managing a grocery shopping list, and viewing the video feed from a doorbell or security camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKiehW"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s main competition is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub from Google&lt;/a&gt;, which has a slightly smaller seven-inch screen and costs $30 less. The Nest Hub supports more video streaming services, has a more useful touch interface, can track your sleep, and works with the Google Assistant instead of Alexa. But it doesn’t have a camera for video calling, its single speaker is blown away by the Echo Show’s dual speakers, and it’s much slower and laggy to use. Ultimately, the choice comes down to how you want to use the smart display and which smart assistant you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJRYq7"&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt;10-inch Portal&lt;/a&gt; is another option if you plan to use a smart display primarily for video calling, but it loses to the Echo Show 8 in effectively every other aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyrdjP"&gt;If you do prefer Alexa, the new Echo Show 8 remains the best smart display to get, as it has a big enough screen to read from across the room, doubles as a great speaker, and comes with a host of camera-related features, including the aforementioned video calling and security camera features. It’s also over $100 less than the motorized Echo Show 10, while still providing many of the same features and capabilities. And given Amazon’s frequent discounts, you’ll likely be able to find the new Echo Show 8 for less than its sticker price quite often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SCxH88"&gt;The new Echo Show 8 doesn’t redefine what a smart display can be, but it’s still a very good virtual assistant with a screen for an attractive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pyT1af"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8966487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5aEiYd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 6th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated after testing Zoom video calling with Amazon’s latest software fix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter has lost legal immunity for users’ posts in India, government argues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SCx55J61sLi0kMwROs-M1DDlNyQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69544721/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crpKYy"&gt;Twitter is now legally liable for content posted by its users in India after failing to comply with the country’s new IT rules, the government said in a legal filing. As reported by both &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-loses-immunity-over-user-generated-content-india-2021-07-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;India’s IT ministry argues in a filing with New Delhi’s High Court that the social media firm has lost its legal immunity after failing to comply with new requirements imposed in May. These include appointing a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer, and a contact person to respond to requests from law enforcement 24 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r60baz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the court filing came in response to allegations from a Twitter user that they had been defamed by tweets posted on the platform, and that Twitter has not appointed the new executives required as part of the new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7CPD"&gt;If the court sides with India’s government, it would mark a major shift in Twitter’s legal obligations in the country, with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; noting it could open the door for its executives to face criminal charges over objectionable content posted by its users. While social media platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;including Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, often take down content in response to legal challenges, they’re generally not legally liable for the contents of their users’ posts. Although the Indian government has claimed Twitter has lost this legal protection, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/limits-of-modis-power-to-control-twitter/"&gt;experts have said&lt;/a&gt; that the final decision ultimately rests with India’s courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dNErxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Following months of escalating tensions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIo8Up"&gt;In the US, social media companies are generally not held liable for their users’ posts thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;. But India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has argued it’s wrong for companies to expect exactly the same protection under Indian law. “The issue is of misuse of social media,” &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports the minister said in a press conference last week. “Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you’ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable.” Prasad denied that the move was aimed at silencing criticism of the country’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqzK9c"&gt;A spokesperson from Twitter declined to comment. The company has previously said it was making efforts to comply with India’s new Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which came into force in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0DYdo"&gt;Tensions have been rising between Twitter and the Indian government for several months. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;police in India raided Twitter’s offices&lt;/a&gt; as part of an investigation into why the company labeled tweets from government officials as “manipulated media.” Last month, the country’s technology minister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;warned Twitter of “unintended consequences”&lt;/a&gt; if the company did not comply with its new regulations, and gave it “one last notice to immediately comply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRfooJ"&gt;Other big tech companies have also clashed with Indian authorities over its new regulations. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;WhatsApp sued the Indian government&lt;/a&gt; over the new rules, claiming they are unconstitutional and will “severely undermine the privacy” of its users. WhatsApp’s concerns relate to a requirement that it track the origins of objectionable messages. The service argues that this would effectively force it to “trace” private messages sent on its platform, ultimately breaking the service’s end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOODWa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 6th, 11:04AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Twitter declining to comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about Karateka’s 37-year-old easter egg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="1984 Apple II game Karateka booted upside down" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQmZzLbAz2Qq5p6UwebcL-wHWFA=/248x0:2615x1578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543439/Screen_Shot_2021_07_05_at_1.20.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geek With Social Skills&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YguQH0"&gt;Karateka, an early martial arts side-scroller published in the US by Broderbund in 1984, was a little before my time. It was created by Jordan Mechner before he went on to make Prince of Persia&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— a game I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember thanks to the horror of sending that character to a bloody, pixelated death on a bed of spikes. Karateka however was an early hit, with later iterations making it to NES and Game Boy. And the original Apple II version included a delightful little easter egg from the early days of PC gaming — putting in the floppy disk upside down would boot up the game upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJHGjv"&gt;This isn’t new exactly — people have been trying this trick for more than 35 years — but it was new to me, and I got a quick refresher today thanks to the magic of YouTube. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC81jebcnijA535zPWGZn6qw"&gt;YouTuber Geek with Social Skills&lt;/a&gt; was demoing the game, and got a note that he should try inserting the game disk upside-down. You can see for yourself what happened when he gave it a try — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WNYrikbtcY&amp;amp;t=169s"&gt;the title screen, intro, and game all display upside down&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a delightfully simple joke, and it took a surprising amount of coding to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc9HFI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/184477/this-is-the-greatest-easter-egg-of-all-time-only-on-the-apple-ii/"&gt;According to Mechner&lt;/a&gt;, the game’s developers hoped that a few people would discover it by accident, and think their game was defective. “When that person called tech support, that tech support rep would once in a blue moon have the sublime joy of saying, ‘Well sir, you put the disk in upside-down,’” Mechner was quoted as saying in a recent profile, “and that person would think for the rest of their life that’s how software works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeFwEw"&gt;Developers, we now know, have had a weird sense of humor forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao5GTj"&gt;Mechner says that he &lt;a href="https://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19585"&gt;didn’t think Broderbund would sign off on it&lt;/a&gt; because it would require a change to the assembly line. But the company did, and a little hidden gem of gaming history was made because the president of a software company had a sense of humor, too. I, for one, am grateful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hong Kong’s new anti-doxxing proposal could put tech companies at risk, says new letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A crowd of people wearing facemasks hold up signs in support of Hong Kong." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNCyI4IsS-IfIkK7X3CsxmFKWMo=/7x0:4144x2758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69543423/1233762251.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Supporters of democracy in Hong Kong protest outside the Chinese embassy in London on July 1st | Photo credit should read Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwTQ7X"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22700279/Industry_Response_on_the_Proposed_Amendments_to_Hong_Kongs_Personal_Data_Privacy_Ordinance_and_Request_for_Virtual_Meeting.pdf"&gt;A new letter&lt;/a&gt; from a tech industry group is driving home the risks of Hong Kong’s proposed anti-doxxing rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vatIr"&gt;Sent to Hong Kong’s privacy commissioner for personal data by the Asia Internet Coalition (which counts Google, Apple and Facebook as members), the letter argues that the new measures will have an extreme impact on due process in Hong Kong, and could result in major US tech companies ceasing operations there. The letter was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-google-warn-planned-hong-kong-tech-law-could-drive-them-out-11625483036"&gt;first obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XKnFM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from... offering their services in Hong Kong.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O9N5jA"&gt;The letter comes in response to series of amendments to Hong Kong’s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO), proposed by the privacy commissioner in response to concerns around online doxxing. Once in effect, the amendments would require swift compliance with any government takedown requests — and ambiguous wording in the text of the bill has spurred concerns that tech employees could be prosecuted as individuals if they do not comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEGRm8"&gt;“Introducing severe sanctions and especially personal liability in relation to assessing requests for taking down content has the consequence of encouraging online platforms to conduct little to no review of requests and over-block content,” the letter reads. “The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from investing and offering their services in Hong Kong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y54dm"&gt;The letter raises new questions about the future of US tech company employees in Hong Kong. The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;estimates that Google, Facebook and Twitter alone keep hundreds of staff in Hong Kong, all of whom could be at risk under the new legislation. Amazon, Apple, Yahoo and Rakuten are also members of the Asia Internet Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfV6Es"&gt;The new amendments come after years of mounting pressure on civil liberties in Hong Kong, as the central Chinese government seeks to exert more influence over the city’s politics. Last year, the passage of a new security law caused Google, Facebook and Twitter to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314900/google-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-government-data-china"&gt;halt all data production requests&lt;/a&gt; while the law could be reviewed. TikTok (which does not operate in China) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315637/tiktok-hong-kong-security-chinese-government-pompeo-us-ban"&gt;ceased its operations in the city entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q94NCx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
