    <title>Someone is using old Jawbone patents to sue Apple and Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jawbone Up hands-on pictures (2012)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbFw6EXUFgunBve-hce0e2rfupA=/4x0:1021x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902309/DSC_3053-hero.1353975716.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jawbone is best known for its fitness trackers, but the recent lawsuits focus on noise-isolation tech used in its earphones.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IaIozz"&gt;Wearables company Jawbone is long-dead — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15931080/jawbone-going-out-of-business-report"&gt;went out of business&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 — but its patents live on, and someone is using them to sue Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU1dh5"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/jawbone-ghost-rises-to-sue-google-apple-over-ear-pods-phones?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, an entity named Jawbone Innovations LLC filed lawsuits against the two tech giants this week in federal court in Waco, Texas. The suits allege that Apple and Google infringed eight patents previously belonging to Jawbone and focused around noise-isolation algorithms originally developed for DARPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8Q2uT"&gt;The suit against Apple names the infringing devices as “all versions and variants of Apple iPhone, iPad, AirPods Pro, and HomePod products,” while the suit against Google is similarly broad, naming “all versions and variants of Google smartphones [...] tablets and/or notebooks [...], earbuds [...] smart home devices [...] and other Android Devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fepgoo"&gt;Both suits demand a preliminary injunction against the companies to stop them from selling the allegedly infringing products, and future royalties for the use of these patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E9JK7f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Who is behind the lawsuits is unclear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qEeawd"&gt;If all this seems like a little bit of legal skulduggery, well, who are we to disagree. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, exactly who or what is behind the lawsuits is unclear, but it’s not the first time Jawbone Innovations LLC has made such claims. The same entity — which does not appear to be contiguous in any meaningful way with the original Jawbone, apart from owning the latter’s intellectual property — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;sued Samsung&lt;/a&gt; in June for similar infringements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epE8Rd"&gt;And, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/jawbone-samsung-patent-infringement-lawsuit"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in its reporting of that case, the manager of Jawbone Innovations LLC, one &lt;a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0803920236"&gt;York Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, also seems to have prior form, with an individual of that name also managing other LLCs that were &lt;a href="https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/patent/968064/additional-former-ibm-patents-move-from-daedalus-to-another-npe"&gt;assigned old IBM patents&lt;/a&gt; before suing Lyft and Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIxmUO"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes, filing such lawsuits in Waco, Texas makes sense, as it’s “a district that’s the most popular in the nation for its patent-friendly judge and juries.” Though even the patent-friendly might reject these particular claims. A spokesperson for Google told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg: “&lt;/em&gt;We dispute the claims, and will defend ourselves vigorously.” We’ve reached out to Apple for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVKAQu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Update your new iPhones and iPads to avoid Apple Music bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFhpQs54LkPY18tEIBEcAT9nbDc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902301/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwikbh"&gt;If you’re an Apple Music user and recently bought a new iPhone 13 model, new ninth-generation iPad, or a sixth-generation iPad Mini, there’s an important update to download to avoid an annoying bug. A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212822"&gt;Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; says a bug affecting those devices restored from a backup can prevent users from accessing the Apple Music catalog, Apple Music settings, or using the services’s Sync Library feature. My colleague Chris Welch reports that he ran into this bug on iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYGNZS"&gt;Thankfully, the fix is very simple, according to Apple. Just head into the “General” section of the “Settings” app, select the “Software Update” option and hit “Install Now,” to get the update. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/apple-music-backup-restore-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that its release notes don’t explicitly mention the Apple Music bug, but this is presumably the update Apple’s support page is referencing. Apple says applying the update should resolve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get the free Windows 11 upgrade early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kuexuS3tdILel6QsbPxWyf94V2c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902174/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qc41qW"&gt;After months of testing, Microsoft is releasing the final version of Windows 11 to its Release Preview channel today. It’s the final step before it’s released more broadly to existing devices on October 5th. If you don’t want to wait until October 5th, you can switch to the Release Preview in Windows 10 today and get the free Windows 11 upgrade early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seL7Yf"&gt;Here’s how to upgrade to Windows 11 early:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tki1pi"&gt;Check to see if your PC is compatible with Windows 11, using Microsoft’s PC Health App (&lt;a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp"&gt;download here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d07Te4"&gt;If your PC is supported, you’ll need to register as a &lt;a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started"&gt;Windows Insider over at Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt; to get the Windows 11 upgrade early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TtonC8"&gt;On your existing Windows 10 PC, head into Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Insider Program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFowqgwCK6TNPmHcRdoTsorn4oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872725/M4GiWlG.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows Insider section in Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hnsMCq"&gt;Click the Get Started button and link the Microsoft account you used to sign up to be a Windows Insider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bpcvQT"&gt;When prompted to pick your Insider settings, select the Release Preview ring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i02slx"&gt;Confirm and agree to Microsoft’s terms, and then reboot your PC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UdTF9I"&gt;Head back into Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security, and you should see a new banner with the optional update to Windows 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mOHqA3"&gt;Click the download and install option and follow the prompts to get Windows 11 early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJUgOTVRh6o3NBHKXGFsg01pWrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872727/Lori_Gamblin_0_1630372025525.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 upgrade prompt for Release Preview Insiders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jPzYFU"&gt;Once you’ve successfully upgraded to Windows 11, you can then head into Settings &amp;gt; Windows Update and select “Stop getting preview builds” to unenroll from the preview updates for Windows 11 and remain on the final version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Rd9T"&gt;Microsoft has also released ISO files for the final version of Windows 11, build 22000.194. You can download the ISO file, which will allow you to clean install Windows 11, from &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/wipISO"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows Insider website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Microsoft Edge’s new tab groups feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C0xDimtgkadMkv379Z9IWqXp1QE=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69902110/msedge_tzPx016ucL.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tab groups can be given a name and an identifying color.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qYr9cj"&gt;Microsoft Edge’s new tab grouping feature arrived this month with &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnote-stable-channel"&gt;version 93 of the browser&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/09/23/our-top-new-features-are-designed-to-put-your-family-first/"&gt;officially detailed&lt;/a&gt; alongside a grab bag of new tools for September, which include new shopping and vacation planning options. Tab groups have existed in Edge for a few months as an optional feature you could manually enable in the browser’s settings, but now they’re rolling out to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="va2ZSb"&gt;To use the tab grouping feature, hold down Ctrl and left click all the tabs you want to group together, then right click and select “Add tabs to new group.” Tab groups can be given names and distinct colors for easy identification, and minimized to reduce clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVqJEP1f_tHTBMZQ8muqrBZZ9gw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874572/W11_Edge_TabGroup_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grouped tabs can be minimized to reduce clutter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4BmrWo"&gt;Tab groups are handy for keeping your work and personal tabs separate, for example, or to easily distinguish the tabs you’re currently working on from the rest. Microsoft Edge is the latest browser to add support for tab groups, which are already available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257446/google-chome-tab-grouping-feature"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mI63bn"&gt;As well as tab groups, Microsoft is highlighting a couple of other features new to Edge this month. These include a product reviews dropdown that can display reviews and customer ratings for products while you browse for them, and a new express checkout option that can automatically enter your payment details and try coupon codes. Edge will also offer travel advice when it spots that you’re booking flights to select locations in the US, and it’ll remember your previously-entered flight preferences as you hop between different booking sites. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox gets a new Edge browser that can play Stadia games, access Discord, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3XBirsRqNnTCa9XnPB67EvPdoSw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901977/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYXloA"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox dashboard that includes an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359838/microsoft-xbox-new-edge-browser-stadia-discord-support-features"&gt;updated version of the Edge browser&lt;/a&gt;. After six months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318050/microsoft-edge-xbox-chromium-browser-testing"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromium version of Edge is now available to all existing Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X consoles, and the new capabilities allow Xbox owners to stream Google Stadia games, access Discord on the web, and lots more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWO0Wz"&gt;The Xbox version of Edge looks almost identical to the version available on PC or Mac. It even includes features like vertical tabs and Collections. Like Edge on PC and mobile, the Xbox version also syncs all your settings, favorites, tabs, and web history. The only feature it’s really missing is extensions, and the ability to switch into developer mode to alter User Agent strings or access a console.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txuhj8xX0w1InqAN3lWUQlnpFk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410205/Xbox_Series_X___Xbox_Series_X_2021_03_31_11_23_32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Edge browser on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi2Tmu"&gt;Edge also supports mouse and keyboard, so you can access things like Word or Excel online, or even Google Stadia games via keyboard and mouse or the Xbox controller. While Xbox doesn’t have a Discord app yet, you can access the web version with this new version of Edge. Discord will let you join voice calls and participate in text channel chats, but microphone support isn’t available, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JAAYh"&gt;This new Edge browser is a big improvement over what existed on Xbox before, and you can even use it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403429/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-edge-browser-mouse-keyboard-support"&gt;access Steam PC games&lt;/a&gt; or web games like &lt;a href="https://krunker.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krunker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.quakejs.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake JS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia is still, bizarrely, blocking access to its GeForce Now streaming service through Edge. We’ve asked Nvidia multiple times why it continues to block Edge in general, but the company only said in April that it’s simply “investigating Edge browser support for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxhE7c"&gt;The new Microsoft Edge browser for Xbox is &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/09/23/september-2021-xbox-update/"&gt;available to all Xbox consoles today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored MacBook Pros could get higher resolution screens, according to beta leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40xb5PsG1u-8jRMbXPaKh99SQPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901962/akramer_201113_4290_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwGEpi"&gt;The latest macOS Monterey beta contains clues about the resolution of Apple’s rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The seventh beta of the upcoming operating system contains references to “3456 x 2234 Retina” and “3024 x 1964 Retina,” which are two resolutions not supported in any of Apple’s current Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxCILs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; theorizes that the two new resolutions correspond to Apple’s much rumored 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;widely expected to launch this year&lt;/a&gt; with new designs and a new Arm-based Apple processor called the M1X. For reference, the current 16-inch MacBook Pro has a resolution of 3072 x 1920, while the current 13-inch MacBook Pro’s display sits at 2560 x 1600. If the new resolutions are accurate, both laptops should see an increase in pixel density as well as screen resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vPIvM"&gt;As well as the improved screen resolutions, both laptops are rumored to feature a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revived magnetic MagSafe laptop charger&lt;/a&gt; and the return of useful &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ports like an SD card slot and HDMI&lt;/a&gt;. The widely disliked OLED Touch Bar is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;reportedly on the way out&lt;/a&gt;. The new laptops are expected to be announced at an Apple event this year, although an exact date is yet to be made public. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fcab5G"&gt;DJI may be about to upend the world of aerial photography yet again — by introducing a drone with drastically improved battery life and &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; cameras instead of one. &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2021/09/23/dji-mavic-3-pro-specs-features-price-release/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasperEllens/status/1441174826131988483"&gt;Jasper Ellens&lt;/a&gt; are both independently reporting that the Mavic 3 Pro is real, coming this November, and it sounds like it’ll have some significant improvements over the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826384/dji-mavic-2-pro-zoom-drone-review-specs-price"&gt;Mavic 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22384692/dji-mavic-air-2s-drone-2021-review"&gt;Mavic Air 2S&lt;/a&gt; introduced earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FFPTK"&gt;While DJI’s standard-sized drones have typically topped out at just half an hour in the air before requiring a battery swap or recharge, &lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt;’s source says we’re now looking at up to 46 minutes of flight time. And that’s despite the additional hardware on board: an entire second camera (with its own sensor and lens) so you can have telephoto and wide angle capabilities in the same drone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WxOw9x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Double the fun” is reportedly DJI’s tagline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFzUiM"&gt;In 2018, you had to pick between the Mavic 2 Pro with its 1-inch sensor and adjustable aperture or the Mavic 2 Zoom with a 24mm-48mm telephoto lens, but the Mavic 3 Pro will apparently be the best of both worlds. First, it’s got an &lt;em&gt;even larger &lt;/em&gt;Four Thirds&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;sensor behind its 24mm f/2.8-f/11 camera, and second, the telephoto lens in front of its new 1/2” secondary sensor stretches out to 160mm for a 15-degree field of view. (The telephoto lens doesn’t zoom in and out by itself itself, but we’re effectively talking about a 6x zoom if you switch between the two cameras.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEJOiU"&gt;The sensors are 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel respectively, if you’re talking stills, and appear to offer 5.2K video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPgW0U"&gt;It also seems the drone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasperEllens/status/1441174826131988483"&gt;can charge directly from a USB-C cable&lt;/a&gt;, like DJI’s Mini drones, instead of having to pop out the battery first. Weight wise, we’re apparently only looking at a slight increase from 907g (Mavic 2 Pro) to 920g for the new Mavic 3 models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Zd8u7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7vXCc"&gt;Yes, models, because like 2018’s Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom, it appears there’ll be two of them again — a Mavic 3 which currently also appears to go by the name Mavic 3 Pro, and a “Cine” model which will reportedly feature a built-in SSD and comes with both a “1Gbps Lightspeed Data Cable” (presumably to get that footage off the internal drive) and a new version of DJI’s Smart Controller (the one with the integrated screen) with upgraded OcuSync video transmission for 15km (over 9 miles) of maximum range — up from 10km on the Mavic 2 Pro and 12km on the Air 2S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17hErm"&gt;Both sources say the Mavic 3 Pro should start at $1,600, the same price the Mavic 2 Pro costs today, but could easily cost another $1,000 for the Cine package. Today, the existing DJI Smart Controller costs $750 all by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cYOJX"&gt;Ellens says these drones are coming on November 15th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Halo-themed Xbox Series X and PS5 are now available through Walmart (update: 9PM ET)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6etFJjv5JSjBEKdsBpJGRqCC-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898014/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBOobq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:55PM ET, September 23rd: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart is going to try again at 9PM ET, good luck! If you don’t get through at first, then try again. Walmart usually restocks in waves every ten minutes or so until systems are sold out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZJGjI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:25PM ET, September 23rd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart’s console restock didn’t get off to a good start. Pages weren’t loading for most people, it seems, and the retailer updated its site with a header saying “Console event to be rescheduled”. We’ll update this post again once we know when the event will happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29Au4E"&gt;Walmart is hosting a big console restock event today, September 23rd, at 12PM ET / 9AM PT.  It’s going to have the PS5 consoles, along with the standard Xbox Series X and the limited edition &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;-themed Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbMpfd"&gt;In case you’re after that &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed console, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Halo-Infinite-Limited-Edition-Bundle%2F288604110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;try your luck at getting one through this link&lt;/a&gt;. Spec-wise, it’s no different than the standard model, but it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"&gt;a more alluring design&lt;/a&gt;, both on the console and the included wireless controller. Two things to note: it’s $549.99, costing $50 more than the regular Series X. Another thing is that this console releases on November 15th, though the game launches a few weeks later on December 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6F44Hm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10718933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mfv5Ml"&gt;Or, you can try to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F141335186&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get the $499.99 Xbox Series X console&lt;/a&gt;, which has a Blu-ray disc drive, around 800GB of useable (but expandable) storage, and includes a wireless controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1LmOSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HhIaF6"&gt;For people who are eager to get a PlayStation 5, Walmart has both editions of the console available today. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You’ll be able to get the $499.99 version&lt;/a&gt; that has a built-in Blu-ray disc drive and a DualSense controller. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F979738052&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s also going to sell the digital version&lt;/a&gt; that lacks a disc drive for $399.99. Both consoles have around 660GB of useable storage, but they’re expandable via their NVMe M.2 slot. If you just plan on playing PS4 games, you can use a cheaper external USB hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="foundation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvKacf-rlGQCP1xdw8IkO1--dLk=/480x0:3360x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901315/Foundation_Photo_010113.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Verge editors discuss the debut episodes of Apple TV Plus’ new series&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g0GpOd"&gt;Ever since &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, every network seems to want something similar: an expensive genre epic that they can point to as &lt;em&gt;our big thing&lt;/em&gt;. This is especially true in the world of streaming. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;Netflix has &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;Amazon is spending an unseemly amount on &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple has &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, a sci-fi series based on the classic Isaac Asimov novels that kicks off with two episodes on September 24th. (New episodes will debut weekly on Apple TV Plus after that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGVc5q"&gt;In many ways, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; fits that tentpole epic formula quite well. It’s a story about the downfall of a galactic empire, with lots of political intrigue to follow. It’s also a lavish production, with incredible special effects and gorgeous production design. You can tell it’s expensive in every frame. Apple clearly has big plans for it; showrunner David S. Goyer &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210920-foundation-the-unfilmable-sci-fi-epic-now-on-our-screens"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that he’s plotted out eight seasons already. But it’s also a pretty weird story, one where you’ll spend more time seeing people doing calculations than anything resembling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POoZ8Z"&gt;Ahead of the premiere, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editors Chaim Gartenberg and Andrew Webster were able to watch the first two episodes to determine just how interesting a space epic about math can really be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS5PR3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s not easy to sum up what &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; is about, but I’ll try. To start, the main “character” isn’t actually a person, but rather a kind of math. At the center of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s story is something called psychohistory, which is a way of using mathematics to analyze the behaviors of large populations. In this world, that means you can whip out a calculator to predict the future in broad strokes, which is exactly what a man named Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) does. As the universe’s foremost expert on psychohistory, he reveals that the Galactic Empire, run by a constant succession of clones (each of which is played by a menacing Lee Pace), is approaching its downfall, which will be followed by thousands of years of barbarism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUArXN"&gt;The emperor doesn’t like that, so Hari and his followers — including fellow numbers whiz Gaal Dornick (Lou Llobell), who won a galaxy-wide math competition just to meet Hari — are exiled to a cold, mostly barren planet at the far reaches of the known universe. There they plan to set up the titular Foundation, with the goal of creating a repository of knowledge that might otherwise be lost during the long, dark period of galactic decline. The first two episodes primarily follow Hari’s initial prediction and exile, along with a terrorist attack on the capital planet Trantor, which seems to signal this period of decline that he predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4k7PMrS5jf_EG7VGcESGn9tNtAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873148/Foundation_Photo_010110.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMII3n"&gt;It’s a lot to squeeze into two-ish hours, and for me it felt like I was getting one long history lesson. The show never really stopped to give me time to care about any of the characters. Fittingly, for a show about math, it was often cold and sterile. Seldon, in particular, feels very detached from the very people he’s trying to save. It doesn’t help that there’s just &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; math talk in the show. People say things like “math doesn’t take sides” and “people lie, numbers don’t” with a straight face, and Gaal is constantly reciting prime numbers in order to relax. At one point, when the Foundation is discussing which parts of various cultures they need to preserve, Gaal goes on a long diatribe about base 10. It’s like being back in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a0REo"&gt;What did you think, Chaim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggGgxy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve got similar mixed feelings about the start of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;. The choice of a more traditional TV series feels like an odd one for the series, given the anthology nature of the source material. (Each “book” is a series of short stories that breaks up the thousand-year scope of the story.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7XMY7"&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; seems to — at least for now — be taking a far more leisurely approach to its adaptation, expanding on the fall of the Empire instead of jumping ahead along the timeline. It’s possible that events will accelerate over the course of the show. There’s a flash-forward early on that indicates that we’ll be seeing more of the story at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sICTSC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, the book, tells readers that the Galactic Empire will fall and that the encyclopedia will eventually be written. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, the show, is intent on showing every step of that process — and like Andrew said, arguing over an encyclopedia is not overly interesting fodder for a TV show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxUCye"&gt;I do love the sheer size and scope of the show, though: the visual effects look stunning, with massive space elevators and uniquely designed ships that help the series stand out from contemporaries like &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEq9_5Ksddz3jcIrPh6gsFvCTTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873150/Foundation_Photo_010201.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2o1G85"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I definitely agree that the show looks incredible. But more than just being aesthetically pleasing, the visuals contribute to the worldbuilding. This really does look and feel like a society that’s composed of many, many different alien cultures, and one that’s been around for a very long time. You can see it in the elaborate costumes — half of the characters look like they just stepped out of the Met Gala — and some of the strange tech. One of my favorite elements is a kind of living painting that needs to be constantly touched up by a skilled craftsman; the emperor even uses it to show off just how advanced his culture is when people come to visit from off-world. It’s a universe that feels real and lived-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSy6Pr"&gt;The problem is, after two episodes, I just don’t care much about anyone in that world. Pace’s emperor is extremely fun to watch, a methodically cutthroat dictator who seems to tower over everyone around him while decked out in blue superhero armor. But no one else has really grabbed me, particularly Seldon and his slightly removed nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VeMor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: 100 percent agreed on Pace, who is absolutely perfect dancing between callousness and charisma as Brother Day. The other pieces of the imperial triumvirate don’t quite measure up, but I like the concept in theory, if not 100 percent in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLEyVP"&gt;But I think part of my bigger issue with the show is Seldon and psychohistory as a whole. It’s sort of like the kid at the playground who decides that his power is “always winning”; the very nature of the books (and therefore, the show) is that Seldon is always correct. He always has a plan; if he loses, that was the plan. And even if things go completely off the rails, well, there was a backup plan that he foresaw, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haXMIIlYK8VmRfdd_-qDQWMJ0NE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873158/Foundation_Photo_010114.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3PyGO"&gt;The Foundation loves to harp on math, which the show hangs onto as the ultimate form of logic and order. It’s a big part of Gaal’s backstory, how she gave up on what seems to be the Empire’s primary dogmatic religion to learn math instead. But &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s math is so esoteric that it’s effectively just sorcery of its own. It’s so complex that no one else on the show can even understand the swirls of dots that make up Seldon’s “Prime Radian” calculator; it’s so advanced that only Seldon and Gaal are the only ones smart enough to comprehend its intricacies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBEMwT"&gt;It’s no wonder that so many people want to kill him, honestly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMQc1L"&gt;I’m curious what you’d want to get out of the rest of the show — more of Gaal, Hari, and Raych (Alfred Enoch) building the Foundation on Trantor? A deeper dive into imperial politics with the emperors and the crumbling of empire? A jump forward in time? It feels like there are a lot of ways the rest of the season (or seasons) could go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iJ85UT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: Just give me some interesting characters! I’d love to see some of the more normal members of the Foundation as they set up a new life on a harsh alien world (we get a slight hint of that in episode 2), as well as how the downfall impacts people on any of the myriad planets that are part of the empire, especially those far-removed from the capital’s decadence. There’s a lot of space, both figuratively and literally, to explore here. The show just needs a little warmth to balance out the evil dictators and intergalactic mathletes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of the Steam Deck’s biggest hurdles just disappeared: EAC has come to Linux</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vEtQCWJa0GMEuX5TtoSQakhq9jY=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69901097/steam_deck.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C37GhF"&gt;Valve promised it would work with anti-cheat software makers EAC and BattlEye to ensure some of the most popular games will run on its upcoming Steam Deck Linux-based gaming handheld, and one of those companies is now officially on board — &lt;a href="http://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-online-services-launches-anti-cheat-support-for-linux-mac-and-steam-deck"&gt;Epic Games announced today&lt;/a&gt; that its Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) now supports Linux and Mac. Not only that, it’s specifically set up to work with the Proton and Wine compatibility layers that Valve’s relying on to bring Windows games to the Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ekx2Q"&gt;While developers would still need to patch their games, this immediately means some of the most popular games on Steam are now theoretically within reach, including &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dead by Daylight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;War Thunder, &lt;/em&gt;which are all among &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/graph/"&gt;the top 25 games on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. Other popular EAC games include &lt;em&gt;7 Days to Die&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Black Desert, Hunt: Showdown, Paladins, &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Halo Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lYB72"&gt;Some key games will still be missing until or unless other anti-cheat providers sign on, though: &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six Siege&lt;/em&gt; are also among the top 25, and all use the rival BattlEye anti-cheat software. So does Epic’s own &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, for that matter, but Epic also hasn’t brought &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or the Epic Games Store to Linux desktops. Epic didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pCh1ZZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve Steam Deck hands-on: the Nintendo Switch of PC gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"},{"title":"Why the Steam Deck won’t flop like Valve’s Steam Machines","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial"},{"title":"Valve is working with AMD to make the Steam Deck Windows 11-ready","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616395/valve-steam-deck-windows-11-support-tpm-amd"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gHCGdC"&gt;Epic does suggest it’s easy for developers to patch their EAC games: “Starting with the latest SDK release, developers can activate anti-cheat support for Linux via Wine or Proton with just a few clicks in the Epic Online Services Developer Portal,” writes Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Oo35D"&gt;You can find ProtonDB’s list of the top games that do and don’t work via compatibility layer &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, as well as current lists of games &lt;a href="https://www.easy.ac/en-us/partners/"&gt;that use EAC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.battleye.com/"&gt;BattlEye&lt;/a&gt; at the links embedded in this sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eTKdr"&gt;Epic made EAC a free service earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VC8L7o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
