    <title>Exceptional growth is the ‘new normal’ for solar and wind energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Onshore wind turbines and electricity transmission pylons at the Little Cheyne Court Wind Farm near Camber, U.K., on Monday, Oct. 26, 2020.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TAlCUKEGc22W7CrekVKPo3nSj7s=/0x0:3901x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269222/1229321378.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Onshore wind turbines and electricity transmission pylons at the Little Cheyne Court Wind Farm near Camber, UK, on October 26th, 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=Bloomberg" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmNYuP"&gt;Solar and wind energy growth soared in 2020 and is on course to keep catapulting upward. Last year, renewable sources of electricity grew faster than they have since 1999. That rapid rise is far from a one-off event, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which said today that the “exceptionally high” growth in 2020 is the “new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FYKYSS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy is elbowing out competition from fossil fuels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R1PXq5"&gt;It’s yet another signal that renewable energy is elbowing out competition from fossil fuels, at least when it comes to electricity. New renewable energy capacity — primarily solar and wind — made up a whopping 90 percent of the power sector’s growth globally last year, according to the IEA, an intergovernmental organization that was founded to monitor the world’s oil supply but now also tracks renewable energy. The agency forecasts renewables to again account for 90 percent of the power sector’s expansion in 2021 and 2022.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBlPta"&gt;That transition to renewable energy for electricity falls in line with many countries’ goals on climate change. President Joe Biden, for example, aims to get the US power sector running completely on clean energy by 2035. Electrifying buildings and transportation so that they can use solar and wind instead of oil and gas is one way governments and the private sector have moved to slash greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOuYHA"&gt;“Wind and solar power are giving us more reasons to be optimistic about our climate goals as they break record after record,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a press &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/renewables-are-stronger-than-ever-as-they-power-through-the-pandemic"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR1zI0"&gt;Renewable electricity capacity grew by 280 gigawatts last year. The uptick amounts to a 45 percent rise in renewables last year compared to the year before. The IEA expects another 270 to 280 GW to come online this year and again in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7UDqU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies purchased renewable energy at “record-breaking” rates &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xuzzVK"&gt;Governments and companies purchased renewable energy at “record-breaking” rates last year, according to the IEA, and their appetite is still growing.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167305/amazon-renewable-energy-purchases"&gt;Amazon proclaimed itself the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; in the world in December 2020, beating out former record-holder Google, and it now has &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210419005307/en/Amazon-Becomes-Europe%E2%80%99s-Largest-Corporate-Buyer-of-Renewable-Energy"&gt;8.5 GW&lt;/a&gt; of renewable energy capacity globally. The IEA’s estimates for global renewable electricity growth over the next couple of years are now more than 25 percent higher than previous estimates it made just six months ago. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s self-contained $1,300 Vive Focus 3 headset has a 5K screen and ships June 27th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Focus 3 standalone headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emqyIrNREKkb728llo-5je26Dk4=/0x34:2000x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269122/VIVE_Focus_3___front_angle_low.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YAnzsU"&gt;HTC is revamping its Vive Focus standalone virtual reality headset, adding a 5K screen, a 120-degree field of view, and a swappable battery. The Vive Focus 3 follows HTC’s Vive Focus Plus. Like its predecessor, it’s a self-contained product that uses inside-out tracking instead of external sensors, designed for business customers. The headset will be released worldwide on June 27th for $1,300 — a price that includes tech support and a suite of business services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvT296"&gt;The Vive Focus 3’s biggest specs upgrade is its display. The headset uses one 2448 × 2448 panel for each eye with a 90Hz refresh rate, compared to 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye with a 75Hz refresh rate for the 2019 Vive Focus Plus. (For the record, there’s no Vive Focus 2 — HTC seems to be retroactively giving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280855/htc-vive-focus-plus-standalone-vr-headset-controllers-pricing-release-date"&gt;the Focus Plus&lt;/a&gt; that status.) That’s a leap over the 2160 x 2160 pixels per eye you’d find with the HP Reverb G2, a more significant bump over the 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye of the Oculus Quest 2, and a vast improvement over first-generation VR headsets from a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Vive Focus 3 back view" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03bKNiZvxHoWCcFtXE8lqWO7cjw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506483/VIVE_Focus_3___reverse_angle_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="agYQ7H"&gt;The Focus 3’s 120-degree field of view also improves on the Focus Plus’ 110 degrees. Where the Focus Plus had a built-in battery, the Focus 3 has a swappable battery that’s mounted on the back of the headset for better balance. HTC promises two hours of battery life and a quick-charge system that will restore 50 percent of the battery with a 30-minute charge. And it uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 chip — based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 — in place of the Focus Plus’ Snapdragon 835.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB1nk7"&gt;HTC also says the Vive Focus 3 will be more comfortable than its predecessor, thanks in part to features like the back-mounted battery, as well as a reworked strap design. Both systems use built-in speakers. But HTC touts a new and improved audio system, including an “audio privacy” setting that reduces the amount of sound people around you can hear — a running issue with VR headset speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S1Xm1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Vive Focus 3 could be a Quest 2 competitor — but HTC isn’t interested for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcq0bS"&gt;The Vive Focus 3 has a lot in common with Facebook’s consumer-focused Oculus Quest 2, which was released last year. The Quest 2 is also a standalone, XR2-powered VR headset. And while HTC’s first controllers were trackpad-based remotes, it’s moved toward a system that basically mimics the Oculus Touch controller. The Vive Focus 3 design features a Touch-style analog stick, two triggers, two lettered face buttons, and one menu or home button on each controller. Hand tracking — which the Quest 2 also supports — is supposed to arrive in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shLRho"&gt;The Vive Focus Plus had &lt;a href="https://service.viveport.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037218671-What-do-I-need-to-do-to-start-a-VIVEPORT-Streaming-session-"&gt;a streaming system&lt;/a&gt; for wirelessly playing PC games on a headset, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400197/oculus-quest-2-air-link-pc-streaming-v28-launch"&gt;the Oculus Quest 2’s Air Link&lt;/a&gt;, and the Vive Focus 3 includes Vive Business Streaming, a cable-based system for connecting it to a PC. (Wireless streaming will be added later, HTC says.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Focus 3 controllers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TOXuzCHQhC2EnFecmmRTDIxB1-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506485/VIVE_Focus_3___Controllers.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9neWh"&gt;HTC Vive general manager Dan O’Brien describes the Vive Focus 3 as higher-end than the Quest 2, not only in specific features like screen resolution and a replaceable battery, but in overall ergonomics and performance. It’s one of only a few headsets that directly compete with the Quest 2’s all-in-one design. And unlike Facebook, HTC doesn’t require a social media-based sign-in — arguably the worst feature of the Oculus Quest 2, and a factor some VR fans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;have called a dealbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guJifZ"&gt;But HTC is steering consumers away from the headset. The company is still maintaining a consumer-focused games store called Viveport, and O’Brien says HTC expects some gamers to buy its newly announced Vive Pro 2. But the Vive Focus 3 was designed with feedback from carmakers, professionals running simulation training, medical companies, and other enterprise customers. Instead of including consumer media or fitness apps, HTC provides services like a centralized device management system or six months of free Vive Sync, a &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2020/04/30/htc-vive-opens-free-beta-vr-collaboration-app-business-vive-sync/"&gt;VR meeting and collaboration tool&lt;/a&gt; that launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UXzeLK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HTC isn’t completely out of the consumer business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLUNxu"&gt;O’Brien says that selling business hardware is simply more sustainable right now than selling to consumers — largely because of price expectations. “The consumer market has gravitated toward these artificially subsidized price points that really only one company in the world has any tolerance for,” he says. That company is Facebook, which sells the Oculus Quest 2 at a starting price of $299 — less than a quarter of the Vive Focus 3’s cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOyZ7e"&gt;“If we wanted to take our products and try to compete in that space, we would have to make the active decision as a for-profit company to lose money for the foreseeable future,” then make it up through software sales or a system like Facebook’s advertising model, O’Brien says. “That’s a very different business model and market, whereas the enterprise and professional market is a very healthy and rapidly growing market where we can bring real value and solutions.” Competitors like Varjo have taken a similar tack, experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21720748/varjo-vr3-xr3-vr-ar-dual-resolution-headsets-price-shipping-specs"&gt;innovative display systems and augmented reality features&lt;/a&gt; but aiming their efforts solely at businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5ois6"&gt;By contrast, HTC’s consumer-focused Vive Cosmos “has not performed as well as we would have liked,” although the company is still looking at ways to advance the brand. “I think the consumer story is still yet to be told from HTC, but that’s something to be told in the future,” says O’Brien. The Vive Focus 3 isn’t part of that story — at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC unveils new Vive Pro 2 with 5K resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oPxABQnTZp2GSLtsMLnSxOn0A1g=/522x0:6119x3731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269156/VIVE_Pro_2___front_right.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VTl4pf"&gt;HTC has unveiled the new Vive Pro 2, an update to its high-end virtual reality headset that adds a host of small but worthwhile improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QZWWI"&gt;The biggest change is the new display, which now offers 5K resolution (or 2448 × 2448 pixels per eye), 120Hz refresh rate, and a 120-degree field of view. That’s a decent step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16863136/new-htc-vive-pro-vr-headset-announced-ces-2018"&gt;original Vive Pro&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2018, which had a 2880 x 1600 resolution, 90Hz refresh rate, and 110-degree field of view. The new Vive Pro 2 also supports Display Stream Compression, or DSC, a first in a VR headset. DSC is a visually lossless standard most frequently seen in high-end monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFcsLg"&gt;As a result of all this, HTC says the Vive Pro 2 delivers “minimal motion blur.” The company also claims that the meshed lines noticeable in many older VR headsets, commonly known as the screen door effect, have been “virtually eliminated” — although these have vastly improved in other newer devices like the Oculus Quest 2 and HP Reverb G2, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vcv9Xq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10492404"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A4HLXJ"&gt;Display aside, the Vive Pro 2 has the usual ergonomic features of high-end headsets, including adjustable straps, quick-adjust sizing dials, and adjustable interpupillary distance (IPD). The integrated headphones are Hi-Res Audio Certified with 3D spatial sound, and the headset also works with third-party headphones. The new Vive Pro 2 will also work with all Vive SteamVR accessories, including Vive trackers, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323093/htc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price"&gt;new Vive Facial Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, and any SteamVR controllers and other accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfw2Fy"&gt;Design-wise, the renders make the new Vive Pro 2 look a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; sleeker and more compact than its predecessor. Though we’ve not yet received weight or dimensions of the new headset nor seen it in person to actually compare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfT0yD"&gt;If you’re upgrading from the original Vive Pro, HTC is running a special promotion during the preorder period, selling the headset on its own (without controllers or external trackers) for $749 / £659 / €739. Once that promotion ends, the price for the standalone headset will be $799 / £719 / €799. A fully kitted-out Pro 2, including Base Station 2.0 and controllers, will be available to buy from June 4th for $1,399 / £1,299 / €1,399.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will pay $100 million to creators using its TikTok competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-pUr9SuScH5h-38XwvEgDVgX2Q=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269159/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Shorts. | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="do3O5E"&gt;YouTube plans to pay $100 million to creators who use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt;, its TikTok competitor, throughout the next year. The goal is to encourage creators to pick up and continually post to its new service, which doesn’t otherwise give creators a built-in way to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buXQFo"&gt;Exactly how much creators can earn is still up in the air. YouTube says that it’ll reach out to creators on a monthly basis, looking for people with the most engagement and views. “Thousands” of creators could get paid each month, YouTube says, and basically anyone who posts to Shorts is eligible. The one caveat is that their videos have to be original content, and, of course, abide by YouTube’s community guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dObFNy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok has started paying creators, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8gpeUW"&gt;YouTube started launching Shorts in the US in March. The short videos appear in YouTube’s mobile app and, just like TikTok (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram Reels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;), you can swipe from one to the next in an endless full-screen feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAHzRj"&gt;Other companies have taken the same approach to encouraging creators to stick with their platform. TikTok launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335404/tiktok-creators-monetization-fund-followers-youtube-content-videos"&gt;a $200 million creators fund&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020, and Snapchat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;paid out $1 million per day&lt;/a&gt; for a period of time after its TikTok competitor, Spotlight, launched in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKxdAx"&gt;Payments will be available in the US and India — the two regions Shorts has launched — to start, but YouTube plans to expand its availability as it rolls out the service to more regions. There’s no specific date yet for when YouTube will start offering payments. YouTube says the fund will last from its start this year through some point in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic wanted Sony’s PlayStation PC games to compete with Steam, documents show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OGWAzTaMBTKfgHRs4ZBM-0UkjSc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269084/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9gQlP"&gt;Epic Games has been trying to convince Sony, Microsoft, and other publishers to bring their titles to the Epic Games Store and is willing to spend millions to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gk8GGH"&gt;A 222-page confidential document, filed as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, reveals a broad effort to compete with Steam during 2020 with free games, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;promotions, and more. The document was originally created in September 2020 and was published and then quickly deleted last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v44ir4"&gt;The documents also show that Epic offered Sony $200 million for at least four first-party PlayStation games last year, ahead of a bigger push by Sony to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297091/days-gone-pc-playstation-games-ports-jim-ryan"&gt;bring more of its PlayStation games to PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/epic-apparently-offered-sony-dollar200m-for-first-party-playstation-exclusives/"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on parts of this document last week, after a &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-offered-200m-to-sony-for-1st-party-titles-on-egs-and-more.422222/"&gt;ResetEra forum thread&lt;/a&gt; detailed one of the slides. We have confirmed the document is real, and it contains lots of details around Epic’s efforts to improve its game store and compete with Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrysLNXU4lUxLRoAsQ8OXwzSaJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506596/3GbPSfj.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games internal document.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lWodgJ"&gt;It’s not clear if the Sony deal fell through for exclusivity, as &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; appeared on both Epic Game Store and Steam last year, with &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt; arriving next week on both platforms. Epic Games has also been trying to convince Microsoft to bring its first-party games to the Epic Games Store. “Their PC Game Pass leader is against what we’re doing,” notes the document, and Microsoft is “effectively bidding against us for content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrMaxi"&gt;Microsoft first started distributing more of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;games to Steam in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but this Epic document appears to suggest that the Xbox maker has been talking to Valve about Xbox Game Pass on Steam. &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/valve-xbox-game-pass-steam-rumor/"&gt;Rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; Valve is keen to get Game Pass on Steam, but nothing has been announced so far. Epic’s document notes that Xbox chief Phil Spencer “is meeting with Gabe at Valve occasionally,” in the same section that discusses Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9caERU"&gt;Epic has also been meeting with Riot Games, Activision / Blizzard, and EA in a bid to get more PC game content for its store. “&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is a longshot,” admits Epic in the document, while also noting the deal to launch &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2&lt;/em&gt; on the Epic Games Store could lead to more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kC5pgkmB_zy_B9EOhJdfUxPPRgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506605/Cuj9cpe.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has apparently been requiring xCloud streaming rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LWJkfv"&gt;Elsewhere in the document, it’s also revealed that Microsoft has apparently been requiring indie devs to agree to xCloud game streaming support to publish on Xbox. “Microsoft is using harsh language around the requirement,” claims Epic, noting that it’s “sign or be removed from Xbox.” We’ve reached out to Microsoft to comment on these claims. Other documents in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial also detailed that Microsoft was proposing to reduce the cut it takes on PC game sales &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415712/microsoft-xbox-store-cut-epic-games-court-documents"&gt;in exchange for xCloud streaming rights&lt;/a&gt;. That cut to 12 percent has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;been announced&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft has not revealed whether developers have to agree to grant streaming rights to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSuPVf"&gt;The document shows how eager Epic was to attract top-selling games from Steam into the Epic Games Store. Epic identified an approximate $500 million revenue opportunity if all titles from competing platforms were available on its store. But out of the top 100 selling games on Steam in 2019, only 20 were available on the Epic Games Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0acw15"&gt;“These existing Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze titles not being on Epic Games Store is a glaring hole in our PC catalog,” admits Epic in the document. “It will be hard to move market share so long as they are not also at Epic Games Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4abbb5"&gt;Epic obviously faces the challenge of convincing publishers and developers to bring games to its PC store, but free games have been the biggest draw. Other documents in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; revealed earlier this month that Epic spent at least $11.6 million on free games, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418782/epic-games-store-free-games-cost-apple-trial-arkham-subnautica-mutant-year-zero"&gt;gained 5 million new users&lt;/a&gt; in return.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/om6ujI_fsTgHXEekErlPJ9uAP00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506615/JTmvUVD.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Epic Games Store monthly active users, excluding &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KfZNGS"&gt;Epic has also been leveraging the popularity of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to bring more people to its store, with free cosmetics and campaigns to launch free games and raise awareness of the Epic Games Store. &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; also boosted the Epic Games Store numbers when it went free-to-play in September, with Epic employees celebrating bigger numbers on its own store than through Steam for launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCodQE"&gt;While Epic revealed in January 2020 that it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam"&gt;100 million Epic Games Store users&lt;/a&gt;, its internal documents highlight how its monthly active user count changes when there are free games. In September 2019, the monthly active user count (excluding &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;) jumped to 10.2 million and then dropped to around 8 million until February 2020, when it jumped back up to 10.14 million when &lt;em&gt;Farming Simulator 19 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Syndicate &lt;/em&gt;were both free in the store. Epic made &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; free in May 2020, and this caused the active user count to jump to a massive 45.4 million before dropping back down to 29.3 million the following month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the new laptops with Intel 11th Gen H-series chips announced today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pE_41P0PTJtuYXHmOrdTwAt0hs4=/0x0:2208x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69268433/razerblade15advancedmid2021_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 Advanced, one of the numerous laptops announced today with Intel’s new chips.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Over half a dozen manufacturers have announced new models&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="P4EoHL"&gt;Intel is adding new processors to its 11th Gen Core H-series lineup today, and over half a dozen laptop manufacturers are announcing new machines that make use of them. In total, there are 10 new Tiger Lake-H processors being announced today, including five consumer processors and five commercial processors, with between six and eight cores. Here’s our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187586"&gt;full writeup on the chips themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQlljN"&gt;According to Intel, its new H-series processors will be used in over 30 upcoming ultraportables (aka: laptops that are 20mm thick or less) and upward of 80 workstations. Companies including Razer, HP, Asus, Lenovo, MSI, Acer, Gigabyte, and Dell are announcing their first laptops with the new chips today, and we’ve rounded up their models below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Cz3cDz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s flagship Tiger Lake-H mobile chips are here to take on Ryzen 5000","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="OoMDjc"&gt;Razer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gy32Ut"&gt;Razer has announced a range of new Blade 15 Advanced laptops featuring Intel’s 11th Gen H-series processors. At the top of the lineup is a model with a Core i9-11900H paired with an RTX 3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory and a 4K 60Hz OLED touchscreen. But if you’re looking for something a little less powerful, you can get a machine that’s just 15.8mm thick, and Razer claims it’s the smallest 15-inch gaming laptop with RTX graphics. This thinner model is a step down specs-wise: it has a Core i7-11800H, an RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a QHD 240Hz IPS display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOASj7"&gt;Razer’s laptops will be available to preorder from May 17th and will ship in June. Prices start at $2,299. Read more about Razer’s new laptops &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22192645"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LUJE3k"&gt;HP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WvcbUt"&gt;HP has three new laptops it’s announcing today: the ZBook Fury G8, the ZBook Power G8, and the ZBook Studio G8. The Studio G8 can be configured with up to an Intel Core i9-11950H vPro processor, alongside an Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU with up to 16GB of video memory (there’s also the option of equipping it with a more creative-focused Nvidia RTX A5000 GPU). Available display options for the ZBook Studio G8 include 1080p IPS, 4K 120Hz IPS, or 4K OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Nlthx"&gt;HP’s ZBook Studio G8 will be available from July at a price that’s yet to be announced. Meanwhile, the Power G8 and Fury G8 will launch at some point this summer. Read more about HP’s new laptops &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22192941"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XjlVf5"&gt;Asus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Zd6jDv"&gt;Asus has new Zephyrus laptops to bring to the table today. First is the Zephyrus M16, which will sit above its more mainstream G-series laptops like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. Asus says the M16 will be configurable with up to an Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU, alongside Intel’s H-series chips. In terms of its display, the Zephyrus M16 has a tall 16:10 aspect ratio, QHD resolution, and 165Hz refresh rate. The company is also announcing the Zephyrus S17, a premium gaming laptop, which is available with up to an Intel Core i9-11900H, 48GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 with 16GB of VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CP9JO"&gt;Pricing and release information for the Zephyrus M16 is yet to be announced. The Zephyrus S17 will be available at some point in Q2 in North America. Read more about Asus’ new laptops &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22189119"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo legion 7i" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGFlK9M51tVzzIqJ2Ys-BwJhQFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505278/legion7iports.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Legion 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GdLzxr"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CxlBXG"&gt;While we’re on the topic of 16:10 displays, Lenovo’s new Legion 7i and 5i Pro gaming laptops also use the aspect ratio for their 16-inch screens, paired with a 165Hz refresh rate. Specs for the 7i range up to the flagship Intel Core i9-11980HK, which can be paired with up to an Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory. Step down to the Lenovo 5i Pro and your most powerful options drop to the Core i7-11800H, with an Nvidia RTX 3070. On the lower end, Lenovo also has models featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187515"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PiCtd"&gt;The Legion 7i and 5i Pro will both release in June starting at $1,769.99 and $1,329.99, respectively. Meanwhile, the 5i will release later in July with a starting price of $969.99. Read more about Lenovo’s new laptops &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22193458"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI GL66 Pulse half open on a table, with black and purple lights in the background.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI’s GL66 Pulse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="88Z1O6"&gt;MSI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Fo2vp"&gt;MSI is announcing a number of new gaming and creator-focused laptops today, ranging from two Creator Z16 models (which are aimed at the kinds of customers that would otherwise have bought a MacBook Pro), down to its more gaming-focused “Katana” and “Sword” machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PR795j"&gt;The Creator Z16 has a 120Hz 16:10 QHD+ touch display and is available with an Nvidia GeForce 3060, and either a Core i7-11800H or a Core i9-11900H. Stepping down to the Creator M16 still gets you a QHD+ display, but its internal specs top out at Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti and Intel’s Core i7. There’s also a new Creator 17 using the new chips, which is available with up to a Core i9 and RTX 3080, and comes complete with a Mini LED display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPKLrv"&gt;On the gaming side, MSI has also bumped over a half dozen laptops up to the new processors, including the GE76, GE66 Raider, GS76 Stealth, GS66 Stealth, GP76 Leopard, GP66 Leopard, GL76 Pulse, and GL66 Pulse. Finally, there’s the new “Katana” and “Sword” laptops. These are available with up to Core i7-11800H CPUs and include versions with Nvidia RTX 3060, RTX 3050 Ti, and RTX 3050 GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tViuNO"&gt;MSI’s Creator Z16 starts at $2,599, its Katana models start at $999, Sword will start at $1,099, and pricing for the Creator M16 is yet to be announced. The laptops are due to release later this month on May 16th. Read more about MSI’s new laptops &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22192869"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ygT1zS"&gt;Dell / Alienware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gZ03Bc"&gt;Not to be left out of the action, Dell has a collection of new laptops it’s announcing based on Intel’s latest-generation H-series processors, with some targeting consumers and gamers, and others aimed at business users. There are Dell-branded models, as well as laptops from its Alienware subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0k2dn"&gt;First up is the Alienware M15 R6. It’s available with up to a Core i9 11900H, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 with 8GB of video memory. It’s got a 15.6-inch display, and there are options for a 1080p 165Hz display, 1080p 360Hz, or QHD 240Hz. Dell is also teasing the Alienware X17 in a series of images, as well as the teaser trailer embedded above. Details on this laptop are currently slim, but the company says it’ll eventually be available with 11th Gen Intel Core processors and 30-series GPUs from Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuEAyj"&gt;Dell is also announcing a new G15 laptop today. The laptop will be available with up to an Intel 11th Gen six-core Core i7 CPU, Nvidia 30-series GPUs, and a choice of 120Hz or 165Hz refresh rates for its 15.6-inch 1080p display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGyDFB"&gt;Away from its gaming machines, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22428917/dell-xps-15-17-refresh-update-intel-chips-10nm-nvidia-gpu"&gt;Dell is also announcing revamped XPS 15 and XPS 17 laptops today&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll be available with Intel’s latest processors, Nvidia RTX graphics, and there’s also a new OLED screen version of the XPS 15. Finally, Dell is also releasing updated models across its business-focused Precision and Latitude lineups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riItWX"&gt;The Alienware M15 R6 will start at $1,299.99, the Dell G15 at $949.99, the XPS 15 at $1,199.99, and the XPS 17 at $1,399.99. All are available from today. Expect more information on the X17  in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dF9hO0"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vraz9b"&gt;Gigabyte is also announcing new laptops across its Aero, Aorus, and G series lineups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9tuXE"&gt;First up from Gigabyte are new Aero series laptops aimed at creators. There’s the Aero 15 OLED, which is available with up to an Intel Core i9-11980HK, RTX 3080, and 4K HDR OLED display. Meanwhile, the Aero 17 HDR is available up to the same specs, but it’s got a larger 17.3-inch display (up from 15.6-inch with the Aero 15) which is IPS rather than OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Idke0"&gt;Meanwhile over on the gaming side, there’s the Aorus 15P, Aorus 17G, and Aorus 17X. The 15P and 17G are available with Intel Core i7-11800H processors and up to an Nvidia RTX 3080 with 16GB of video memory. The Aorus 15P has a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display that’s available with either 240Hz or 360Hz refresh rates, while the Aorus 17G has a 17.3-inch IPS display with a refresh rate of 300Hz. The Aorus 17X also has a 17.3-inch 300Hz IPS display and is available with up to an RTX 3080, but it features a more powerful Intel Core i9-11980HK processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnsva1"&gt;Finally, there are Gigabyte’s 15.6-inch G5 MD and G5 GD, and its 17.3-inch G7 MD, and G7 GD laptops. Resolution and refresh rate is 1080p and 144Hz across the board. The G5 MD and G5 GD have Intel Core i5-11400H processors, the G7 MD has an i7-11800H, and the G7 GD has an i5-11400H. The laptops are equipped with Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvYlpp"&gt;The Aero 15 OLED starts at $1,799, and the Aero 17 HDR starts at $2,499, and both are officially on sale today. The Aorus 15P starts at $1,599, and the 17G starts at $2,099 (pricing for the 17X was not available at time of publication), and they’re also available starting today. Preorders for the new G5 and G7 models also open today, with the G5 starting at $1,149.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JfIPf1"&gt;Acer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2yqkWn"&gt;Acer has three new laptops it’s announcing today: the Predator Triton 300, Predator Helios 300, and the Nitro 5. All three are spec bumps of existing models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Smiuy"&gt;The company says its Triton 300 will be available with up to a 4.6GHz Intel 11th Gen H-series processor, an Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU, and 32GB of RAM. Available displays include a 165Hz QHD screen, or a 360Hz 1080p panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SijjV"&gt;Next up is the Helios 300. It’s also available with Intel’s latest processors paired with 32GB of RAM, but it maxes out at an Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU. Like the Triton 300, it’s also available with a 360Hz 1080p or a 165Hz QHD display. Similarly, the Nitro 5 is also available with Intel’s latest-generation chips, an RTX 3070 GPU, and 32GB of RAM. Acer says the Nitro 5 is available with 15.6 or 17.3-inch QHD IPS displays with 165Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1nucFC"&gt;The Predator Triton 300 will be available in North America from July starting at $1,699, while the Nitro 5 will be available from June starting at $999. Pricing and availability for the Predator Helios 300 was not available at time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EV charging in the US is broken — can Joe Biden fix it?</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The president’s plan to take EVs mainstream will first need to contend with a fractured charging network&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="R955AR"&gt;Aaron Fisher first came face to face with the US’s inconvenient and broken electric vehicle charging infrastructure two years ago. Driving a borrowed BMW i3 from New York City to Hartford, Connecticut, for his grandmother’s 90th birthday party, he assumed the journey would be a short, three-hour jaunt. Instead, it lasted a grueling seven hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anHupP"&gt;“I had charger issues, I had payment issues, I had customer service issues, I had routing issues, because of the fragmentation around electric vehicle charging,” Fisher said. As for his grandmother’s birthday? “I missed her dinner,” he said ruefully. “She was not mad, but very disappointed.”     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rI6Xiu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I had charger issues, I had payment issues, I had customer service issues, I had routing issues”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6mwYt"&gt;There are approximately 41,000 public charging stations in the United States, with more than 100,000 outlets. But finding one that actually works or isn’t locked inside a gated parking garage can be a bit of a scavenger hunt. The charging experience in the US is almost comically fragmented, especially for non-Tesla owners. While Tesla’s Supercharger network has been praised for its seamless user experience and fast charging ability, the opposite appears to be true for pretty much everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9E9b8"&gt;Fisher, a former management consultant who also briefly interned in the Obama White House, was so frustrated by his experience trying to drive an EV in the US that he founded his own company, &lt;a href="https://evpassport.com/"&gt;EVPassport&lt;/a&gt;, based on the principle that charging your electric vehicle should not require signing up for a dozen different smartphone apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="truYug"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FXClEw"&gt;“You shouldn’t have to hand over your birthday, you shouldn’t have to hand over your email address, you shouldn’t have to hand over your full name, or anything in an application or agree to any type of privacy policy necessarily, in order to charge your vehicle,” Fisher said. “You don’t have to do that when you get gas. Why do you have to do that when you’re trying to do something better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdufBn"&gt;Fortunately, the whole system appears headed toward a massive overhaul. President Joe Biden, an avowed muscle car guy who is currently trying to claim the mantle of “most environmentally friendly president in history,” recently introduced a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;$174 billion of which is earmarked for electric cars&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that plan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden wants to build 500,000 new EV chargers by 2030&lt;/a&gt; — 11 times the current number of stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IlundW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s kind of like banking in the ’90s.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B2kjwF"&gt;Biden will have his work cut out for him. Despite rapid growth in sales over the past few years, EVs are still a niche product, making up just 2 percent of the new car market and 1 percent of all cars, SUVs, vans, and pickup trucks on the road. That said, sales are expected to pick up in the next few years, depending on new incentives and point-of-sale rebates that are currently being debated. But when they do, there are real questions about whether the nation’s disjointed, low-tech, outdated charging system will be up to the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAO1Oj"&gt;“There’s no APIs in the charging marketplace,” Fisher said, referring to the software intermediary that allows two apps to communicate. “It’s kind of like banking in the ’90s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An EV charging station in Clifton, New Jersey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4mYHUq"&gt;The Charging Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qf779J"&gt;On paper, the EV charging network sounds like it’s doing pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh8Ycm"&gt;A closer look reveals how incredibly uneven it is. One-third of those stations are located in one state: California, with a whopping 22,620 stations, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/01/02/got-an-electric-car-great-where-do-you-plug-it-in"&gt;recent study by Pew Trust&lt;/a&gt;. Other states have few, bordering on none. North Dakota has 36 public chargers, Alaska just 26.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm4M6k"&gt;But don’t mistake California as some sort of bastion of enlightened EV ownership. A recent study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00814-9.epdf?sharing_token=uF_2e31XTz7IdZatbzc2n9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OdQo1MtvaTf2fRd9Yuvl4XeI57cinWGD0KaEwg1kf5THhCyeCk3r2oBBFOSmxwPbmP0qC6zHJ87gfQNLGiweb_Ea1e6LlFPBHPCoZ_WO4gyXhTae0rZ7jUJ1X6COdfcI1XGB1s_GpyHsXFrZ8kfVdgiDUVELizUFlWo69AA2XYSm27uS_KovYj15euvibQ6-0%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=arstechnica.com"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by a research team from the University of California, Davis found that about 1 in 5 EV owners — 20 percent of plug-in hybrid vehicle owners and 18 percent of pure battery-electric vehicle owners — eventually switched back to gas-powered vehicles. The top reason cited was “dissatisfaction with the convenience of charging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fhNjg"&gt;This shouldn’t come as a surprise. “Range anxiety,” or the fear of running out of power before finding the next charging station, has long been cited as a major barrier to mass EV adoption. But while range has steadily improved over the years, with many EVs now able to travel 300 miles or more on a single charge, the anxiety has shifted to the inadequacies of the charging network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ApsvLV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The anxiety has shifted to the inadequacies of the charging network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yJuzcs"&gt;Chargers can be hard to find, and the act of charging takes much longer than refueling a gas car. The research team at UC Davis noted this in their study. “The way in which a [plug-in electric vehicle] is charged has not changed, whereas vehicle range has been increasing since [plug-in hybrid electric vehicles] and [battery-electric vehicles] were introduced,” they conclude. Electric vehicle owners “have the option to purchase longer-range vehicles, whereas they cannot yet purchase a vehicle that is charged differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAD63W"&gt;EV boosters say that much of the problem stems from a faulty frame of reference. We see how many gas stations are available — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gasbuddy.com%2Fgo%2Fgas-price-report-january-18-2020%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DUnlike%2520fuel%2520retailer%2520apps%252C%2520as%2Capp%2520focused%2520on%2520gas%2520savings.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22419150%2Fev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;around 150,000 by some estimates&lt;/a&gt; — and believe that the same should be true for chargers if EVs are ever to replace their gas-powered counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGSYdT"&gt;This ignores the fact that most EV owners do their charging overnight while parked in their driveway at home. But if EVs are to become a more attractive option to car buyers, charging stations are going to need to become more pervasive like gas stations. People need to see the expansion with their own eyes in order to overcome the psychological hurdle that prevents them from imagining an electric future. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dkOQOm"&gt;There are educational obstacles, too. The way car companies communicate the amount of time it takes to charge an EV completely misses the point, said Chris Nelder, manager of Carbon-Free Mobility at the Rocky Mountain Institute. Automakers avoid talking about kilowatts and kilowatt-hours, instead relying on the nonsense metric of miles-per-minute of charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtpBi1"&gt;“We all understand this when it comes to gasoline,” Nelder said. “We all know what a gallon is. We all know how many gallons of gas our tanks can hold. We all know how many miles per gallon our vehicles get. But for some reason everybody operating in this space is afraid to explain to a customer what the equivalent is on the electric side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqXxCD"&gt;This is one of the educational hurdles that the Biden administration will confront in its quest to get more people in EVs. But it’s not clear the administration is focused on education, so much as incentivizing the purchase of more EVs through tax credits, point-of-sale rebates, and direct subsidies to automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4izoi"&gt;Money, the policymakers have determined, will be the thing to spur this shift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IsY2xU"&gt;The Money Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TABdH5"&gt;The White House has said it will spend at least $15 billion to begin rolling out the new charging stations. But experts say far more will be needed to shore up charging infrastructure to meet the growing demands of EV ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkOMEm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.governing.com/next/biden-wants-500-000-charging-stations-how-will-we-get-there"&gt;Wedbush Securities has estimated&lt;/a&gt; that at least $60 billion will be needed to build 500,000 chargers by the end of 2030, as Biden has stated. Another analysis by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/us-ev-charging-system-a-priority-under-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan.html"&gt;industry consultant AlixPartners&lt;/a&gt; said $50 billion would be needed to grow the US charging network to meet the demand within the next decade. That means Biden will need at least $35 billion more, either from private investments or state and local government matching funds, if he is to meet his goal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ub1d5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden will need at least $35 billion more if he is to meet his goal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enmMdm"&gt;Installing EV chargers can be expensive, depending on the level of charging that’s being offered. The higher the level, the quicker the charge and the more expensive it is to install. A public Level 2 charger might cost $2,000 out of the box, but a DC fast charger of 150kW or more can cost between $100,000 and $250,000, Nelder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VplS8C"&gt;The federal government could intervene in making those costs cheaper, but it won’t be easy. That would require sitting down with utility companies and regulatory commissions in all 50 states, as well as the private EV charging companies, to bring down the capital investments for charging stations through &lt;a href="https://www.cenhud.com/my-energy/electric-vehicles/EV-make-ready-program/"&gt;“make ready” programs&lt;/a&gt;. These are programs in which public utilities and local governments identify sites that are intended for EV charging and allow companies to submit bids for installation. There is no federal “make ready” program, though, and only a few states employ this method of fast-tracking EV charger installation. The Biden administration could make things a lot easier by creating a national system for states to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QpvZw91acBO0TZ0iZ0f8SE8e16M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498539/ahawkins_20210503_4551_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An EV charging station in Clifton, New Jersey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rdZDJt"&gt;Another looming problem is utilization and how utilities charge for the electricity they provide. Most EV charging stations sit unoccupied because EVs still only make up a tiny fraction of the overall car market. That means the business case for building more chargers is very difficult to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMjFif"&gt;“It’s that first few years where you want me to put a quarter million into a station, and then I can’t get better than 5 percent utilization,” said Henry Lee, director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s environmental and natural resource program. “I lose my shirt in the first three or four years, but by year seven or eight, I could be making money on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nBfOCm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I lose my shirt in the first three or four years, but by year seven or eight, I could be making money on it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P8aBki"&gt;Lee noted that the cost of electricity is another problem for EV charging companies. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/getting-the-rates-right-for-a-public-electric-vehicle-charging-buildout"&gt;Demand charges&lt;/a&gt; from utility companies tend to dominate charging companies’ operating costs, further complicating the business case for building more charging stations. The total cost of electricity is higher based on the level of charging they provide. These calculations need to be rethought if the government wants to incentivize the EV charging industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix16Q5"&gt;“How you restructure this formula for these kinds of stations is something that we haven’t quite figured out,” Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c2Qo4A"&gt;The Tesla Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuMtv"&gt;Tesla’s Supercharger network is often held up as the best possible example of an EV charging network: fast, reliable, and plentiful. But Tesla’s network is also exclusive to Tesla owners, meaning someone driving a Volkswagen EV wouldn’t be able to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5iiBE"&gt;Other EV companies have expressed interest in a proprietary system. Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35892061/rivian-adventure-ev-charging-network/"&gt;said recently it would build its own network&lt;/a&gt; of 3,500 fast chargers at 600 locations around the country by 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHU2TE"&gt;These kinds of close systems are worrisome if more car companies decide they want their own networks. But Nelder said that two automakers building their own exclusive charging networks isn’t necessarily an indication of where things are headed for EV charging. First of all, Nelder said that Rivian’s goal of 3,500 fast chargers in two years was almost impossible, given the intense and expensive amount of work that each site requires.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVMCB7"&gt;“I literally laughed out loud,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="YRHgYn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qARK6f"&gt;But even then, Nelder said he hopes that the Biden administration is strict about what kind of charging projects are eligible for public money. “To whatever extent public money is being spent, it should only be spent on sites that are available to the public,” he said, “and that’s certainly true for this Biden infrastructure spending plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPG1HF"&gt;Ideally, more electric vehicles will include the Plug and Charge standard that was initially introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55365.html"&gt;ISO 15118&lt;/a&gt;. This standard enables an EV to automatically identify and authorize itself to a charging station on behalf of the driver. For example, when it goes on sale in the US later this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes-Benz EQS&lt;/a&gt; will be compatible with about 90 percent of the public charging stations in the US without the need to download an app or sign up for an individual charging service, thanks to the Plug and Charge system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa0aWx"&gt;But there are many EVs coming onto the market without Plug and Charge, such as the Volkswagen ID 4 and Chevy Bolt EUV, and it’s unclear why. This is another source of frustration and confusion for Aaron Fisher of EVPassport. It’s a sign that for all the good news on the horizon, the EV charging infrastructure in the US will remain opaque and challenging for months, if not years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pJ2fXW"&gt;“It feels like they’re missing some very core decisions at a high level,” Fisher said of the auto industry. “I don’t know if it’s a lack of planning, or just they’re trying to focus on cars and getting them out the door.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the real Alexa: voice actor reportedly responsible for Amazon’s AI assistant revealed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pZK5vmTYJ0uQeQ3l53BhdT3Hhs=/1x0:1083x721/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69268067/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_1.38.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journalist Brad Stone says Nina Rolle is the original voice of Alexa. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ninarolle.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nina Rolle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxS7hQ"&gt;Amazon’s Alexa has a voice familiar to millions: calm, warm, and measured. But like most synthetic speech, its tones have a human origin. There was someone whose voice had to be recorded, analyzed, and algorithmically reproduced to create Alexa as we know it now. Amazon has never revealed who this “original Alexa” is, but journalist Brad Stone says he tracked her down, and she is Nina Rolle, a voiceover artist based in Boulder, Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gifn7T"&gt;The claim comes from Stone’s upcoming book on the tech giant, &lt;em&gt;Amazon Unbound&lt;/em&gt;, an excerpt of which is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-amazon-made-alexa-smarter/"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Wired. &lt;/em&gt;Neither Amazon nor Rolle confirmed or denied Stone’s reporting, which he says is based on conversations with the professional voiceover community, but Rolle’s &lt;a href="https://www.ninarolle.com/"&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt; alone makes for a compelling case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to1azF"&gt;Listen to the videos below: the first an advertisement for Cherry Creek North, “Denver’s premier outdoor retail destination,” and the second an introduction to Hapyn, a social app that seems to now be defunct (its Play Store &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F544363296&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22430185%2Falexa-voice-actor-amazon-nina-rolle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; was last updated in 2017). You can absolutely hear Alexa’s reassuring tones in Rolle’s voice. Or, to be more precise, you can absolutely hear where Alexa’s reassuring tones come from when listening to Rolle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1jRqLV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zztoCRmT_ds?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="3oFNjI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psyfHVAhA_s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aygA22"&gt;Here’s how Stone writes up the process in selecting Alexa’s voice: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ojiuX2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believing that the selection of the right voice for Alexa was critical, [then-Amazon exec Greg] Hart and colleagues spent months reviewing the recordings of various candidates that GM Voices produced for the project, and presented the top picks to Bezos. The Amazon team ranked the best ones, asked for additional samples, and finally made a choice. Bezos signed off on it. Characteristically secretive, Amazon has never revealed the name of the voice artist behind Alexa. I learned her identity after canvasing the professional voice-over community: Boulder, Colorado–based voice actress and singer Nina Rolle. Her professional website contains links to old radio ads for products such as Mott’s Apple Juice and the Volkswagen Passat—and the warm timbre of Alexa’s voice is unmistakable. Rolle said she wasn’t allowed to talk to me when I reached her on the phone in February 2021. When I asked Amazon to speak with her, they declined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qCjuxs"&gt;We’ve pinged Amazon and Rolle to confirm her involvement in creating Alexa, but don’t expect to hear much back. If the company isn’t interested in confirming Stone’s account, it suggests this is a bit of history they’d rather not draw attention to, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcQ4UB"&gt;Providing the voice for such a ubiquitous product can have its own drawbacks, too. The original voice artist behind Siri, Susan Bennett, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/4/4801812/the-voice-of-siri-is-susan-bennett"&gt;revealed herself in 2013&lt;/a&gt; (after seeing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/17/4596374/machine-language-how-siri-found-its-voice"&gt;an article from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dissecting the process behind the creation of synthesized voices, incidentally) but said she’d been wary about being associated with Siri. “I was conservative about it for a long time [...] then this &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; video came out [...] and it seems like everyone was clamoring to find out who the real voice behind Siri is, and so I thought, well, you know, what the heck? This is the time,” Bennett told &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/04/tech/mobile/bennett-siri-iphone-voice/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWHr5G"&gt;Of course, although we can hear both Bennett and Rolle’s voices in their AI doppelgängers, it’s impossible to say without inside knowledge exactly what traces of the original remain. Creating a synthetic voice &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; with real audio samples, but this data is exhaustively quantized and remastered to such a degree that answering the question of whether the final product is the same as the original is best reserved for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus"&gt;shipbuilders of Theseus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOEnbW"&gt;What is, fun, though, is listening to the other examples of Rolle’s voiceover work on her &lt;a href="https://www.ninarolle.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Although she offers a restrained performance in the videos above, she’s much more animated and lively in other commercial samples. It really shows how, despite the ever-increasing sophistication of Alexa’s voice, it still lacks the range of the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Magic Keyboard alternative is $30 off at multiple retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQ7MNWY6va58GVwwPcDz-1CFaGo=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267987/Logitech_Folio_Touch_Keyboard_Case_with_Trackpad_for_iPad_Pro_Overhead_Press_Shot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Logitech’s keyboard alternative is nearly half the price of Apple’s Magic Keyboard. | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NskKBN"&gt;Unless you’re willing to shell out for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, Logitech’s Folio Touch might be your best bet for turning your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;second-gen, 11-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; into a laptop. Right now, both &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Trackpad-Connector-11-inch/dp/B08HRQV5V8?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740253167256169203#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are taking $30 off the well-regarded keyboard case, rendering it one of the best sales we’ve seen on the device in recent months. In addition to the dedicated trackpad and a fabric-like finish, Logitech’s offering features like backlit keys, iPadOS integration, and more protection than you’ll get from any of Apple’s proprietary offerings. It’s heavy, sure, but the added heft is a small price to pay when compared to the cost of a replacement screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PTxSKi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10493403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5OVimo"&gt;It’s hard to talk about platforming without mentioning the most iconic plumber in existence (and for good reason). Luckily, if you happened to have missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274990/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-nintendo-switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mario’s latest 3D romp for the Nintendo Switch, you can pick up a physical copy of the game for $10 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury/dp/B08H9M7LDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-3D-World-Bowser-s-Fury-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-00045496594022%2F381081868&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Like the last time it went on sale, today’s deal will likely only be available for a limited time, meaning now is your chance to nab the enhanced Wii U port and its feline-focused expansion before the price jumps up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xiaxLt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10468219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yY0SP7"&gt;Sony’s next-gen 1000XM4 earbuds may be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428676/sony-1000xm4-earbuds-leak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just around the corner&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking to pick up a budget-based pair of fitness earbuds, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&amp;amp;H Photo are all still offering a sizable, 51-percent discount on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302861/sony-sp800n-noise-canceling-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WF-SP800N&lt;/a&gt;, bringing Sony’s mid-tier wireless earbuds to $98. They don’t sound quite as detailed as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony 1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; — nor did they make our list of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; — but they pack formidable lows and proper sweat resistance, giving them a slight edge over the 1000XM3 at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
