    <title>Intel’s new desktop GPUs won’t work in AMD systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kM0Pkx8OPNI9cchAE87UlPKFq2o=/57x0:1992x1290/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728505/intellogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z5mGRH"&gt;Intel launched its first Iris Xe desktop graphics cards yesterday, but you won’t see them appearing in AMD-powered systems. While Nvidia and AMD’s desktop GPUs typically work across a variety of Intel and AMD processors, Intel’s new desktop GPUs are a little more limited for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7a2tXb"&gt;“The Iris Xe discrete add-in card will be paired with 9th gen (Coffee Lake-S) and 10th gen (Comet Lake-S) Intel® Core™ desktop processors and Intel(R) B460, H410, B365, and H310C chipset-based motherboards and sold as part of pre-built systems,” says an Intel spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://www.legitreviews.com/intel-iris-xe-discrete-card-will-only-work-with-select-cpus-and-motherboards_225470"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;Legit Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “These motherboards require a special BIOS that supports Intel Iris Xe, so the cards won’t be compatible with other systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VprjXRBos3nS3fYLLeXIv4TbOsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261494/dg1_3d_rwd.png.rendition.intel.web.978.550.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Intel’s first Iris Xe desktop GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9IGJ5"&gt;The restrictions make more sense when you consider the target market of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251142/intel-iris-xe-graphics-cards-desktop-gpu-pc"&gt;these first Intel desktop GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. Intel is working with Asus and other vendors to sell these cards to system integrators who will bundle them with prebuilt systems. These aren’t GPUs you can just order online, and they’re meant to be specially bundled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt2CLF"&gt;Intel’s idea with its initial Iris Xe desktop GPUs is to simply improve what’s available on mainstream PCs right now. Most standard business-focused PCs ship with integrated graphics, and Intel is trying to offer something that improves multi-display support and hardware acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paYRBV"&gt;These cards aren’t designed to improve gaming or to be used in gaming rigs. Intel is also working on its Xe-HPG architecture that could eventually deliver cards that can compete with AMD and Nvidia. Hopefully these cards won’t be restricted to Intel systems in a similar way, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly set to mass-produce iPads outside China for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-mG4Gqfj0mgvSL3FDZ1f4Jlh5ps=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728363/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdXg9Z"&gt;Apple could start manufacturing iPads in Vietnam by the middle of this year, marking the first time a “significant number” of the tablets would be produced outside of China, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Apple-ramps-up-iPhone-and-iPad-output-shift-to-India-and-Vietnam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. As well as shifting iPad production, Apple is also reportedly increasing the number of iPhones manufactured in India, where it’s produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338436/apple-iphone11-india-foxconn-china"&gt;some iPhone 11 units since last year&lt;/a&gt;. It will reportedly begin producing iPhone 12 series devices in the country as early as this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmOQ39"&gt;The report paints a picture of a company that’s increasingly keen to diversify its manufacturing out of China, despite hopes that trade tensions could ease under President Biden. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; notes that the new administration has said it won’t immediately ease tariffs on Chinese imports, and there are also other factors like rising labor costs in China prompting Apple and other companies to look for alternative manufacturing hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QOARp4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More audio products could be produced in Vietnam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2I76A"&gt;Beyond iPhones and iPads, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that Apple is ramping up manufacturing of a host of other devices outside of China. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266574/apple-airpods-pro-vietnam-china-chinese-manufacturing"&gt;reports last year&lt;/a&gt; that Apple moved some AirPods Pro manufacturing to Vietnam, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says it’s also planning on expanding HomePod mini production in the country and will also move some MacBook production. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721353/apple-ipad-macbook-foxconn-manufacturing-vietnam-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported on Apple’s early plans&lt;/a&gt; to shift MacBook and iPad production to Vietnam last year.) Some Mac mini production has also been moved to Malaysia, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3rXzF"&gt;News of Apple’s shifting supply chains comes a little under two years after reports emerged that Apple was planning to move between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691132/apple-china-manufacturing-diversify-india-vietnam-trade-war-tariffs"&gt;15 and 30 percent of its manufacturing out of China&lt;/a&gt;. It now appears much of that shift is well underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s using AI to plan electric car trips because EV charging is still a nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NG4YpGyIzJT5P6dVEMgETKfRC7Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728278/ahawkins_201221_4352_6489.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CLNkI4"&gt;Google announced today a new feature for electric vehicle owners that uses artificial intelligence to sort through thousands of public charging stations while finding the best route. The level of technology needed to make this type of route planning functional is a pretty clear indication of what an unholy mess EV charging in America is today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH5Z1s"&gt;In a blog post published Wednesday, Google acknowledges that route planning in an EV can be like “solving a puzzle” (which is an overly polite way of saying it), with EV owners needing to find the right charging station within range that also has the specific type of plug their car needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9ak4p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google acknowledges that route planning in an EV can be like “solving a puzzle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Th78rg"&gt;The new feature will only work for electric vehicles with Google’s native Android Automotive system installed as their primary operating system. Right now, the only two models with Android Automotive are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;the Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;Volvo XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, but Google says more are on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ECTH2"&gt;Google is using a newly developed routing algorithm that uses a type of math called &lt;a href="https://medium.com/basecs/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-theory-77969829ead8"&gt;“graph theory”&lt;/a&gt; to present charging stop recommendations to EV owners based on their location, the amount of range left in their vehicle, and the type of plug their vehicles use. Google writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WOZ0Rj"&gt;Now when you enter a destination that requires two or more recharge stops, algorithms in Maps will search and filter through tens to thousands of public charging stations to find the most efficient route — all in less than 10 seconds. You can see how long each charge will take and your updated total trip time, so your final ETA will never again be a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cO1xUS"&gt;EV charging stations in the US typically feature one of two types of standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), which was first rolled out in 2013; and CHAdeMO, a trade name for a quick charging method. Nissan and Mitsubishi use CHAdeMO, while Jaguar and BMW use CCS, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NGgkG"&gt;Tesla has yet to offer CCS adapters for its vehicles. It does offer CHAdeMO adapters, but the charging industry appears to be moving toward the CCS standard. That’s still been slow going, though. The US government’s Alternative Fuels Data Center’s database says there are still more places to fast-charge CHAdeMO vehicles than those with CCS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2WeOb"&gt;Google Maps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21023979/google-maps-ev-charger-plug-chademo-ccs-tesla-search-filter"&gt;recently added&lt;/a&gt; a new feature that lets you search for electric car charging stations based on the type of plug they offer. But this feature uses more data about your range and plug type to help take some of the guesswork out of route planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yBYWY8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;EV charging in the US is a bit of a patchwork&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y6uTdy"&gt;The new algorithmic route planning will also work on shorter trips and will soon include details about methods of payment accepted at the individual charging stations for European customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvLO1S"&gt;EV charging in the US is a bit of a patchwork, with companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"&gt;like EVgo&lt;/a&gt;, Electrify America (which is owned by Volkswagen), and ChargePoint all offering different levels of voltage and plug compatibility. Some stations are more functional than others, and there’s a general lack of real-time information for EV owners about which stations are in service and which aren’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPbi9k"&gt;President Joe Biden wants to throw the weight of the federal government behind improving the charging infrastructure in the US. He has pledged to spend billions of dollars to add 550,000 EV charging stations in the US over the course of his term in office. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 now has official modding support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jackie, your partner in Cyberpunk 2077, in front of a table dancer at a nightclub." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKEi2MQcrxSU33txuYYeqUy2DGg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728167/Cyberpunk2077_Ladies_And_Gentleman_The_US_Cracks_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mqgxkH"&gt;CD Projekt Red has added modding tools and resources to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for players to adjust their experience. The developer announced the news on its &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/modding-support"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. “Tools will be continuously updated alongside with game patches to ensure compatibility,” the post reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UU6HUY"&gt;The game has been rife with problems since its launch late last year. CD Projekt Red released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;first big patch&lt;/a&gt; on January 22nd. The update is part of a larger effort to clean up the game’s problems, with more significant fixes to come. Since the patch’s release, however, players have run into at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248682/cyberpunk-2077-update-bug-workaround-cd-projekt-red"&gt;one game-breaking bug&lt;/a&gt; introduced in the update; the developer has since released a workaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ1iqk"&gt;Although the tools are official resources from CD Projekt Red, players have been modding their experiences since the game’s release. While some enhance the experience, like enabling a &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-working-third-person-mod-1845981222"&gt;third-person camera&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/14/22229642/cyberpunk-2077-mod-judy-saul-river-takemura-party"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt;, others &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/6/22215667/cyberpunk-2077-mod-scene-third-person-view-minimap-change-v-appearance"&gt;serve as fixes&lt;/a&gt; for the game’s many bugs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is getting Tomb Raider and Skull Island anime series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9e1yb4Kv6mQGbaf9cF91jpbheEo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68728043/ss_7496de2518ddb1b58db0004d1386b4e48c442367.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6Qu5e"&gt;Netflix is working on yet another video game adaptation with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1354461071067627520"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; anime in the works&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t know much about the series just yet, but it will take place after the events of the recent trilogy reboot. (That series wrapped up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17845776/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;2018’s &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ3Y5P"&gt;And there’s more anime on the way as well, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1354459156720152578"&gt;with a series based on &lt;em&gt;Skull Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and set in the same universe as Legendary’s recent Godzilla and King Kong movies. The latest, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22246258/new-trailers-godzilla-kong-comrades-son-south-hbo-max-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is set to debut very soon. The tagline for the anime is: “A shipwrecked crew, an island of monsters, and one king to rule them all.” Both the &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Skull Island&lt;/em&gt; series are being produced by Legendary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bv5cpF"&gt;The announcements continue two trends for Netflix: a focus on anime and video game adaptations. The streaming service saw huge success with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is based on the books, but a franchise that grew in part due to video games) and will soon be expanding that with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;live-action&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077253/witcher-netflix-anime-korean-studio-mir-henry-cavill-live-action-show"&gt;anime spinoffs&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/15998770/castlevania-netflix-adi-shankar-interview"&gt;Netflix already has a &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; anime series&lt;/a&gt;, and adaptations of both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348468/netflix-splinter-cell-animated-series-adaptation-witcher-castlevania-john-wick"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536079/netflix-assassins-creed-live-action-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are also in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRK2aw"&gt;There’s no word yet on when either series is expected to debut on the streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is expanding its robot-powered fulfillment centers to ‘dozens of locations’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart Black Friday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VkNTb5poc0lAkJcPqm-FWovmVhA=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727898/walmart.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRvyI6"&gt;Walmart is planning to increase the number of local fulfillment centers across the United States, it &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/27/from-ground-breaking-to-breaking-ground-walmart-begins-to-scale-local-fulfillment-centers"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart’s approach of more localized fulfillment centers is a direct parallel to Amazon’s strategy, as both companies continue to face off amid an increasing demand for online orders. The new fulfillment centers are warehouses that will either be built within or adjacent to its existing retail locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tn87P"&gt;Walmart’s &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/01/08/how-walmarts-alphabot-is-helping-to-revolutionize-online-grocery-pickup-and-delivery"&gt;first fulfillment center opened in 2019&lt;/a&gt; in Salem, New Hampshire, when the retail giant started piloting the concept. These warehouses use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302356/walmart-robots-labor-costs-replacing-human-tasks-floors-scanning-inventory"&gt;wheeled robots&lt;/a&gt; — called Alphabots — to pick items from the shelves and prepare orders placed online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1YhVht"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart is piloting new technologies for some of its fulfillment centers, such as an automated curbside pickup feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPBHrX"&gt;Alphabots will retrieve items ordered online such as boxed or frozen items. However, the company said that its human employees would still be tasked with grabbing fresh items like meat and produce in addition to larger items. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Walmart&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Walmart stores will add automated pickup points for seamless curbside pickup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NDDj4g"&gt;Walmart is piloting new technologies for some of its fulfillment centers, such as an automated curbside pickup feature, which will allow buyers or delivery drivers to drive up to a specific location, scan a code, grab their order, and go, all without leaving their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIIct0"&gt;Walmart hasn’t said which locations will receive fulfillment center add-ons, but the company announced in its &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/27/from-ground-breaking-to-breaking-ground-walmart-begins-to-scale-local-fulfillment-centers"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it's already planning “dozens of locations, with many more to come.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spin is testing remote-controlled electric scooters to prevent blocked sidewalks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hu5TV33C3vXyGoWZKHkh5Px0SOA=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727502/1_ptsDYzC_wGU5l2FCzpaCGg.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uvtbgD"&gt;Spin, the scooter company owned by Ford, is testing a new scooter that can be controlled by a remote operator. The scooters, Segway’s T60 model, look different than Spin’s regular fleet with the addition of a third wheel in the front. They’re also outfitted with sensors and other technology provided by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20910083/tortoise-autonomous-electric-scooters-self-driving-robotics"&gt;a startup called Tortoise&lt;/a&gt;, which has been testing how teleoperation could potentially make fleets of shared electric scooters easier to manage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjb5vw"&gt;Starting this spring, Spin plans to start testing 250 remote-operated scooters in Boise, Idaho, before deciding whether to expand the pilot to additional markets. Tortoise’s software — which uses the scooters’ front- and rear-facing built-in cameras — makes it possible for remote operators to move the scooters when they happen to be blocking sidewalks or street traffic. It will also eventually make it possible for an e-scooter to travel several blocks to riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAKCEc"&gt;“There has been a lot of fanfare around the potential of teleoperated e-scooters, but this partnership marks a turning point in tangible operational plans to bring them to city streets,” Ben Bear, chief business officer at Spin, said in a statement. “In addition to providing reliability to consumers and more order to city streets, this could significantly improve unit economics, reducing the operational work required to maintain and reposition fleets, while cutting down on mileage spent traveling to rebalance vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OVRfT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The problem this pilot aims to solve is one that has plagued the shared scooter industry since its inception&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j4yJId"&gt;The problem this pilot aims to solve is one that has plagued the shared scooter industry since its inception. Right now, scooters are gathered up every night by teams of independent contractors for charging and rebalancing. These freelance scooter hunters get paid based on how many scooters they can collect each night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20696405/dockless-scooters-share-repo-men-repossessor-lawsuit-tow-yard-lime-bird-lyft-uber-razor"&gt;which has led to arguments, fights&lt;/a&gt;, and the occasional weapon being flashed. Scooters get damaged, diminishing their lifespan. Fraud and hoarding are rampant. It’s a massive logistical challenge that can be dangerous for the freelancers involved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rkH4SgQpRrMb3oqJ6FGt_Lj4Gb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262917/1_5BC2KQ_HTjEr__VJV_bXTQ.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="spxbYJ"&gt;Meanwhile, riders have a difficult time tracking down available scooters when they want one. They block sidewalks, obstructing the path for people in wheelchairs and other pedestrians with mobility concerns. They all end up cluttered in a handful of places, rather than spread evenly around a city. And cities have complained about the companies failing to place enough scooters in low-income and minority communities to ensure equal distribution across economic lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p06vN"&gt;Tortoise has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263728/tortoise-gox-remote-control-electric-scooter-peachtree-corners"&gt;previously tested out its remote-operating technology&lt;/a&gt; in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. The scooters, which were owned by a shared service operator called Go X, didn’t have three wheels. Rather, they had two extra smaller wheels in the middle of the deck that could pop out like training wheels to help balance the scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaQMqN"&gt;The Segway T60, which was first introduced by the Chinese scooter manufacturer a year ago, is supposed to be a more stable model built specifically for this type of application. When it was released, Segway called it a “roboscooter,” with a “reverse tricycle chassis” made for global scooter-sharing service providers. Spin noted that the T60 has enhanced suspension, three independent braking systems (regenerative rear brake, front and rear drum brakes), and turn signals (on handlebars and near the rear wheel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNSYF4"&gt;So how will it work? After a ride is completed, Tortoise’s teleoperators (who are located over a thousand miles away in Mexico City) may reposition the scooter if it’s parked somewhere where it’s unlikely to get another trip or if the scooter is blocking the sidewalk, crosswalk, or a handicapped-accessible space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKM7lI"&gt;Later this year, Spin says it will offer in-app “scooter hailing” that allows customers to request an e-scooter in advance or in real time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="gamestop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcFg0ITlVpyREK7RKR18itgELdk=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727484/GameStop_Store_Front_0.1419980119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;gamestop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Reddit meme that bludgeoned a hedge fund&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="96E7uo"&gt;There are three things to remember as you watch the chaos unfolding with GameStop’s stock price. First, Wall Street is just what happens when you mix money with feelings. Second, the internet is real life. And third, the Street always wins, especially if you’re trading with Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XOCzE"&gt;If you haven’t been paying attention, GameStop’s stock has been soaring in a remarkably volatile fashion; on January 22nd, GameStop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;zoomed upward 69 percent&lt;/a&gt; (nice) before it triggered a circuit breaker halt. The following Monday, January 25th, GameStop trading was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-shares-surge-toward-fresh-record-ahead-of-opening-bell-11611579224"&gt;halted &lt;em&gt;nine times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cHz861"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAWDdv"&gt;On the surface, this doesn’t make sense. GameStop, founded a year before Blockbuster, is part of a dwindling cohort of IRL businesses that are being starved by online marketplaces. These days, you can just buy video games over the internet instead of going to a soul-killing strip mall in Iowa City to buy a physical copy of the game. GameStop’s business has been suffering as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fk2MFO"&gt;Currently, many people are at home and bored, and consequently, interest in day trading has shot through the roof. There is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-15/big-investors-are-dying-to-know-what-the-little-guys-are-doing"&gt;a Reddit forum for this&lt;/a&gt;, r/WallStreetBets, which describes itself as being “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.” A year ago, a user called &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4zlkt/gamestop_investment_thesis/"&gt;delaneydi argued that GameStop&lt;/a&gt; was underpriced by the market. For a while, the idea that r/WallStreetBets would take over GameStop was a joke — but then it turned serious, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7VxL3"&gt;If you think GameStop will fail and the stock will go down, or even that the company will go bankrupt, there’s a way to make money on that. Typically, this is done by short selling — a practice where you borrow shares for a fee and sell them for (ideally) a high price, then buy them back at (ideally) a lower price to return them. This can make you a lot of money, especially if the company goes bankrupt and you don’t have to return the stock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MjbT1"&gt;The thing about short selling, though, is that you lose money if the stock goes &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, and your losses are potentially infinite if the stock &lt;em&gt;keeps&lt;/em&gt; going up. There are several other bad things that can also happen, such as an increase in fees or the original investor wanting their stock back. This means some shorts will be forced to “cover,” or buy the stock back at a high price, which sends the price even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SnYvSm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lAwWDx"&gt;Right now, more people are betting against GameStop than betting it will succeed. “Short interest is 71.2 million shares, while GameStop has only 69.7 million &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm"&gt;shares outstanding&lt;/a&gt;,” Matt Levine of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-25/the-game-never-stops"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;. Some people will notice that kind of thing and think, &lt;em&gt;Hm, this stock is prime for a short squeeze!&lt;/em&gt; Basically, because so many people are short, it may be possible to trigger a chain reaction where you buy enough stock to send the price up, forcing some shorts to cover, sending the price up further, forcing more shorts to cover, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEMmpm"&gt;For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper because of apps such as Robinhood. In addition to letting you buy and sell stock, you can easily buy an &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; for stock, instead of the stock itself. If you are feeling confident in a stock, you can buy a &lt;em&gt;call option&lt;/em&gt; — which lets you buy a stock at a specific price on a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLEEOl"&gt;Let’s say my fake investing firm wants to buy a call option on Company X. Currently, shares of Company X are trading at $10. I feel confident in Company X, so I buy options that let me buy 100 shares of Company X stock for $25 a share on March 1st. This contract is usually cheaper than the share price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHF6jH"&gt;So let’s say Company X goes on an epic run in February, and by February 15th, it’s up to $50 a share. I can sell my options for more than I paid for them, if I want. Or I can continue to hold onto them until March 1st, when I take delivery of the 100 shares, which are now trading at $55 a share, and immediately sell them. As a result, I make a profit of $30 per share, minus whatever fees I paid for the options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AnhZ9o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SS4Es8"&gt;On the other hand, maybe I bet badly and Company X only gets up to $20. In that case, my losses are limited to whatever fees I paid for my options — I just never buy the shares. This makes options a riskier bet than just buying Company X stock directly, because I might just lose all the money I spent on the options, instead of at least getting to own the stock. But it means there’s a lot more upside as well, because I didn’t have to spend all the money on the stock upfront. If risk is your idea of fun, options are great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrILUl"&gt;Now, someone has to be on the other end of my trade. The outfit that sold me the options is going to try to reduce the risk that my options will hurt them, and they will do this by buying stock in Company X. That makes the stock go up, and the further up the stock goes, the more stock my counterparty will have to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhSwve"&gt;Options were once a fairly sophisticated thing to trade — something ordinary people didn’t really do. But Robinhood makes the option trades easy and free. Plus, there’s a social aspect to the trades — which is where r/WallStreetBets come in. Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrrCx"&gt;Day traders, such as the ones on r/WallStreetBets, are typically held in contempt by professional traders, and they are &lt;em&gt;acutely&lt;/em&gt; aware of this. The professional short-sellers who created the possibility of a short squeeze underestimated the day traders’ sophistication, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/gamestop-tug-of-war-gives-reddit-army-a-win-on-record-volatility"&gt;r/WallStreetBets pounced&lt;/a&gt;. Time to troll Wall Street out of a fuckload of money! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="S9xjJ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GameStop’s short-sellers have been trolled out of about $5 billion in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UG9032"&gt;The fine people of r/WallStreetBets decided GameStop was undervalued, and the stock would go up, so they put up a bunch of posts about how they were buying GameStop options. This drove up the stock price for GameStop, as their counterparties had to load up on stock to balance, and then more stock as more people bought options and so on. The soaring stock meant some shorts had to cover, sending the stock up further. As of January 26th, short-sellers have been trolled out of &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-sellers-squeezed-losses-reddit-traders-army-cohen-palihapitiya-2021-1-1030006226"&gt;about $5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, just from their GameStop positions alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhNvql"&gt;What does Robinhood have to do with this? Well, it makes options trading much more accessible to retail investors — but there’s something else. Trades on Robinhood are &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;! But Robinhood isn’t offering free trades to be nice; the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html"&gt;gets paid by some big-time investors&lt;/a&gt; such as Citadel Securities to see what retail investors are doing. This phenomenon, which other brokerages are engaged in as well, is called payment for order flow. Citadel Securities makes its money on these orders by “automatically taking the other side of the order, then returning to the market to flip the trade. It pockets the difference between the price to buy and sell, known as the spread,” according &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b"&gt;to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gv6wUR"&gt;The argument in favor of this practice is, essentially, retail investors get better prices than they would on the open market, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-16/carl-icahn-wants-to-fight-dell-again"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Levine writes&lt;/a&gt;. The practice is controversial, though, because some critics say it harms investors. It’s theoretically possible to “‘front run’ orders by, for example, jumping ahead of a customer’s stock purchase to buy it themselves, making a small gain if the share price increases,” the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;explains. “There is no suggestion that Citadel Securities engages in such activity, which is prohibited by SEC.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORMAjh"&gt;Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321"&gt;got in trouble with the SEC&lt;/a&gt; for “misleading statements and omissions” about how it made its money by selling the orders its traders made to other firms. According to the SEC, Robinhood investors got second-rate prices, which cost them a collective $34.1 million. The company paid a $65 million fine in December to settle charges, and the practices the SEC objected to “do not reflect Robinhood today,” Dan Gallagher, the brokerage’s chief legal officer, &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-65-million-settlement-sec-probe-misleading-statements-order-flow-2020-12-1029902927"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UrhGZm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wall Street can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; get in on screwing Wall Street&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45pVyd"&gt;When asked for comment, Robinhood referred to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/robinhood-ceo-becoming-an-investor-is-the-new-american-dream-just-like-home-ownership-was-before.html"&gt;an op-ed published by Vlad Tenev&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO and co-founder. The company says its customers are mostly “buy and hold”  investors, not reckless ones. The op-ed said nothing about payment for order flow, and Robinhood declined to comment on the practice in a follow-up email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wyFvh"&gt;Citadel Securities is winning on this, though! Last June, the company was responsible for 40 percent of shares traded by retail investors, the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;wrote, citing Piper Sandler. It doesn’t just get Robinhood’s orders either — TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab also work with Citadel Securities. “Not only are retail market makers getting increased trading volume, they are likely getting increased profitability per trade,” Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets Association, told the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1RbaG"&gt;Which means that Wall Street can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; get in on screwing Wall Street. And it’s not just Citadel Securities. I’d be very surprised if high-frequency trading algorithms weren’t also getting in on the fun. Plus, Chamath Palihapitiya, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;Silicon Valley SPAC&lt;/a&gt; icon, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232"&gt;has decided to yolo along&lt;/a&gt; with the Redditors. (“Yolo” as a verb appears to be part of the r/WallStreetBets peculiar parlance.) Elon Musk, a man who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18509371/skabooshka-twitter-elon-musk-tesla-short-seller-tslaq"&gt;notoriously hates short-sellers&lt;/a&gt;, is also observing the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oTDAAd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Gamestonk!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/RZtkDzAewJ"&gt;https://t.co/RZtkDzAewJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0U6UPM"&gt;At least one Wall Street firm has taken heavy losses — Melvin Capital Management, which was shorting GameStop, among other bets. It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340"&gt;bailed out by Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, which, confusingly, is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;the same thing as Citadel Securities. (Citadel is a hedge fund, not a market maker.) Both firms were founded by the same guy, though: Ken Griffin. And by bailing out Melvin, Griffin got “a rare opportunity to invest in a talented manager on the cheap,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/bros-on-reddit-bludgeon-melvin-capital-in-warning-to-wall-street"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljqf1g"&gt;What does this have to do with GameStop itself? Absolutely nothing — this is a weird game now. And the market’s frothy, too; in July, I joined Robinhood to see how it works. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;ethics policy forbids us from directly trading stock in companies we cover, so for research purposes I picked six stocks that belong to companies I don’t cover because their earnings were next on the calendar. (I actually don’t know what several of them do.) I am a buy-and-hold investor because I am a bore, but as of today I’m a bore who’s up 30 percent. One more time: &lt;em&gt;I know nothing about these companies except that I won’t have to write about them.&lt;/em&gt; It’s easy to feel like a genius in a bull market, and a lot of first-time day traders are probably very bullish on their investing sense right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfCvs7"&gt;At this point you may be wondering whether what r/WallStreetBets is doing is illegal — after all, it’s a group of people trying to artificially drive up a stock price in order to sell for outsized profits. And the answer is: well, maybe? It definitely seems like a pump-and-dump scheme, but — this part is crucial — no one’s &lt;em&gt;lying&lt;/em&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-26/will-wallstreetbets-face-sec-scrutiny-after-gamestop-rally"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Levine points out&lt;/a&gt;. Theoretically, the SEC could chase down the r/WallStreetBets investors, since no one’s really anonymous on the internet, but this seems like a lot of effort for what is not actually a slam-dunk case. It is “an enforcement nightmare,” James Cox, a professor at Duke University School of Law, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/reddit-fueled-rallies-like-gamestop-s-defy-easy-crackdown-by-sec"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c4ftf1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s not just GameStop anymore&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m94g7Q"&gt;Also, GameStop’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/gamestop-short-sellers-reload-bearish-bets-after-6-billion-loss?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;shorts seem undeterred&lt;/a&gt; — as some older shorts are getting out of the market, they’re being replaced by new ones. Perhaps this is because they are anticipating the “dump” portion of the pump-and-dump scheme; perhaps this is because they’re awaiting quarterly earnings, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/gamestop-shares-almost-always-plunge-following-earnings-report"&gt;which usually tanks GameStop’s stock&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe they’re just having fun, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw4GZn"&gt;But: it’s not just GameStop anymore. r/WallStreetBets &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackberry-amc-and-other-reddit-yolo-favorites-that-arent-gamestop-11611681716"&gt;is yoloing its way&lt;/a&gt; into electric carmaker Nio, OG tech company Blackberry, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;AMC, the movie theater chain&lt;/a&gt;. And if those day traders are doing it, then the market makers that buy the order flow from Robinhood are yoloing along for the ride. And one thing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; clear: what Citadel Securities is doing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lx9Mso"&gt;So what happens next? I don’t know — but I suspect that someone on Wall Street will find a way to make money on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s new $60 video doorbell is its smallest and cheapest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zd66-ZE5tPjDGckjk7Al76at30=/5x0:1148x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727371/rings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkINbc"&gt;Amazon’s Ring has debuted its latest video doorbell, the (blandly named) Ring Video Doorbell Wired which, at $59.99, is the cheapest and smallest doorbell that the company has ever offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQzw8A"&gt;As the name implies, there is one major limitation of the new Ring Video Doorbell Wired — unlike its pricier siblings, it can only be used as a hardwired doorbell, instead of the battery-powered option offered by products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174876/amazon-ring-new-video-doorbell-3-plus-chime-pro-pre-roll"&gt;Ring Doorbell 3&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249028/ring-video-doorbell-specs-price-date"&gt;$99.99 Ring Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; that the company refreshed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0noJtzDBqFSHpdKTnNvYAlDukj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22262876/ring_video_doorbell_wired_intro_tablet_696x522_2x.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BTjRMR"&gt;Assuming you’ve got your home wired already, though, the rest of the Video Doorbell Wired checks all the boxes for a Ring doorbell: 1080p video, night vision, custom motion detection zones, and support for other Ring products and services like the optional Ring Protect subscription. And, of course, given that it’s an Amazon product, the new Video Doorbell Wired is also fully compatible with Amazon’s Echo products, which can be used to see who’s at your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE3rQg"&gt;It’s effectively a wired version of the previous entry-level Ring, the aforementioned Video Doorbell, just without the integrated battery and a sleeker design (likely because it ditches the rechargeable battery). But at $40 less, it seems like a good option for anyone looking to start out a Ring home security setup — assuming you’ve got the wired setup or home improvement knowhow to get it installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLK5On"&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell Wired is available now to preorder for $59.99 from Ring and Amazon, ahead of a February 24th release date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max hits subscriber goal two years ahead of schedule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rnQTElUJv70QGRqsUDLl6LKOMME=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68727318/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hlcq53"&gt;&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeSubscriberGoal012721&amp;amp;source=Verge"&gt;HBO Max &lt;/a&gt;has nearly 40 million US subscribers, AT&amp;amp;T disclosed in its first quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Combined with traditional HBO subscribers, the platform has surpassed a 41 million subscriber milestone the company says it didn’t expect to hit for two more years. Globally, AT&amp;amp;T says HBO now has more than 60 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buQRlu"&gt;There are a few caveats worth mentioning. For one, AT&amp;amp;T has different metrics for different levels of its subscriber base. Total subscribers includes not only people who pay for a standalone subscription, but also those with access to HBO Max either through an existing HBO subscription through a cable company or through a promotion via AT&amp;amp;T’s cell carrier business, regardless of whether they’ve even downloaded the app. That total subscriber number for the US market is the more than 41 million figure AT&amp;amp;T is touting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ah5BTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says the growth is due to ‘Wonder Woman 1984’ and its big streaming bet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOVC0E"&gt;But of the 37.7 million HBO Max domestic subscribers out there (the remaining few million being pay TV subscribers), about 17.2 million subscribers are considered “activated,” AT&amp;amp;T’s term for someone who has downloaded the app and either signed up independently or upgraded an existing subscription (or claimed a free one via promotion). Still, it’s a strong number compared with the end of September, when HBO Max boasted 28.7 million subscribers, of which only 8.6 million had been activated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwDFLZ"&gt;For context, Disney Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;hit more than 86 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in a little over a year, though it costs less per month than a standalone HBO Max subscription and released without a bogged-down rebrand of an existing, cable-driven service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpEKdo"&gt;In unsurprising fashion, AT&amp;amp;T is crediting the growth to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; to release the films of its subsidiary, Warner Bros., on HBO Max on the same day they release in theaters. “The release of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; helped drive our domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers to more than 41 million, a full two years faster than our initial forecast,” said AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqerB3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;/em&gt;sequel is just the first of many planned film releases on HBO Max that were once scheduled for exclusive theatrical windows — until the coronavirus pandemic upended Hollywood. High-profile film directors, including of Warner Bros. releases like the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; adaptation and &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;voiced their extreme disapproval of the decision&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgWXd3"&gt;But AT&amp;amp;T, which owns parent company WarnerMedia that oversees both HBO and Warner Bros., claims this strategy is paying off, for now. There’s no telling yet how the huge investment in streaming will affect Warner Bros.’ relationship with directors like Denis Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan going forward, and whether the HBO Max subscriber growth AT&amp;amp;T is attributing to &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; will continue onward through the rest of this year’s release slate. &lt;/p&gt;
