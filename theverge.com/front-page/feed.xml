    <title>Amazon confirms its support for Matter</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YjlYFo"&gt;Amazon has affirmed its support for the smart home connectivity standard Matter, announcing in a &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2021/11/support-for-matter-over-thread-coming-to-echo-and-eero-devices"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt; that it will support Matter over Thread in its Echo devices and Eero Wi-Fi routers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero had previously confirmed its support of the standard&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says the announcement is about “further expanding Amazon’s commitment to Matter and reinforcing its smart home philosophy of flexibility, privacy, collaboration, and interoperability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OLSFc"&gt;Additionally, Amazon has joined Apple, Google, and Samsung on the Thread Group Board of Directors — it has been a member for five years. Alongside Wi-Fi, Thread is a primary protocol for Matter. It provides a low-power, low-bandwidth, and low-latency mesh network for smart home devices to connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufs62n"&gt;The company confirmed that the Echo 4th gen will gain Matter over Thread support, with support for additional Echo devices coming later. Earlier this summer, Amazon said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586377/amazon-echo-matter-standard-dot-show-studio-flex-plus-upgrade"&gt;it would upgrade most of its Echo smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; to support Matter, including most Echo and Echo Dot speakers and every Echo Studio, Echo Show, Echo Plus, and Echo Flex. All Eero Pro, Eero Beacon, Eero Pro 6, and Eero 6 devices have Thread radios in and already act as Thread border routers for Thread devices to connect to. They will gain Matter support next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="15Q1PJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 4th Gen Echo will be the first one to get Matter support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9iWN0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is an IP-based application protocol that will establish a common language and common interaction model across smart home devices and ecosystems. With support for Matter over Thread and Wi-Fi in Echo devices, Alexa users should be able to connect any Matter-enabled smart home devices to their Echo smart speakers and control them within the Alexa app and with Alexa voice control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcHycT"&gt;For example, Amazon name-checked Eve in a list of companies it is working with around Matter. Eve, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;makes smart home devices&lt;/a&gt; such as sensors, plugs, switches, and lighting, has previously only worked with Apple’s HomeKit, but with Matter, its products will be able to connect to Alexa and other smart home ecosystems. Amazon also mentioned Yale, Wemo, Schlage, Sengled, Netatmo, Nanoleaf, Tuya, eWeLink, and Leedarson as brands that are creating Matter over Thread devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aum2WY"&gt;One of Matter’s main promises is multi-admin control. This means you should be able to control any Amazon smart home device that supports Matter using any other Matter controller. SmartThings, Google, and Apple have all committed to Matter, so in theory, you will be able to use those companies' apps and voice assistants to control your Amazon smart home devices, should you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QOWPM"&gt;There are no Matter devices available to buy yet, as the standard is still being finalized. But according to the Connectivity Standards Alliance, which oversees Matter, we should start seeing Matter-enabled smart home products later in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE0VSw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL579P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVADbM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stack Overflow’s copy / paste keyboard is no joke</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Hear me out&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wRd2Pw"&gt;A Stack Overflow-branded keyboard with just three buttons (Ctrl, C, and V) is a &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/"&gt;great April Fools’ gag&lt;/a&gt; that has no business being as neat and useful as it is. And yet Stack Overflow and manufacturer Drop have managed to turn The Key into a surprisingly competent little $29 accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mq8uQG"&gt;On its surface, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-macropad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Key&lt;/a&gt; looks like it’s only capable of doing two things: copying and pasting. You shamelessly copy your code from Stack Overflow’s thousands (millions?) of helpful contributors and paste it into your own work. Simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6kzsh"&gt;But The Key is a lot more powerful than that. It draws upon QMK open-source keyboard firmware so that it can be fully reprogrammed to do so much more than just copy and paste. It’s not the most user-friendly process, but it’s enough to turn The Key from a goofy novelty into a great little accessory. And it might actually be worth tracking one down when Drop has more in stock next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FlsmLW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10843447"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fJr7fl"&gt;Right off the bat, I should say that in functional terms The Key isn’t doing anything particularly new or original. Head over to eBay and search for “Macro Keypad” and you’ll find dozens of inexpensive keyboard add-ons with anywhere from a single blank key to nine or more. The &lt;a href="https://keeb.io/products/bdn9-rev-2-3x3-9-key-macropad-rotary-encoder-and-rgb"&gt;BDN9 from Keebio&lt;/a&gt; is another option I’ve seen recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftk3vY"&gt;But The Key ends up succeeding where another diminutive keyboard I bought a couple of months back did not. And it’s also available preassembled, unlike other boards that are aimed much more firmly at hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pjr2iU"&gt;For starters, The Key is straight up nicely made. Its case is made out of aluminum, and underneath each key is a linear Kailh Box Black switch that’s just a hair stiffer than regular Cherry MX Reds. Press one, and it has a nice thunk to it, like you’d expect from a mechanical switch. It even has a modern USB-C port on its back for connecting to your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgTAiw4v-rzOFfAiBNgyUi8gfJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938115/jporter_211018_4805_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kailh Box Black switches sit under each key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6dgcrF"&gt;More importantly, it’s also got relatively &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Ftalk%2F93641%2Fhow-to-configure-stack-overflow-the-key-macropad%3Fsort%3Dvotes&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;easy-to-follow instructions available on Drop&lt;/a&gt; to help you reprogram it. In contrast, the last macro board I bought arrived without any documentation in a plain cardboard box, and its eBay listing directed me toward a chaotic Discord server filled with confused customers and (admittedly) helpful support staff. For all I know, there are much better documented cheap macro boards available, but my experience so far wasn’t ideal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hFDpV"&gt;Before I get into reprogramming The Key, I should clarify that, yes, it’s capable of copying and pasting out of the box… for most Windows users. The key with the Stack Overflow logo acts as your “Ctrl” key, and the C and V keys act as you’d expect. You know the drill, you don’t need me to explain how copying and pasting works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Idxc9w"&gt;Obviously this is a problem for Mac users, where the default copying and pasting shortcuts rely on the Cmd key rather than Ctrl, and any Mac users who want to use The Key will have to reprogram their device accordingly. The Key’s layout was also a problem for me specifically because I use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18223384/dvorak-qwerty-keyboard-layout-10-years-speed-ergonomics"&gt;Dvorak keyboard layout rather than QWERTY&lt;/a&gt;, which confused The Key’s default layout and caused the C key to register as a “J,” and the “V” to register as a “K.” What I needed was for the “C” switch to be rebound to “I” and for the “V” to be rebound to the “.” (compare &lt;a href="https://thekindle3books.com/qwerty-vs-dvorak-the-two-great-keyboards-the-time-were-born/"&gt;QWERTY’s layout side by side with Dvorak&lt;/a&gt; and this will make a little more sense). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcWrIg"&gt;Fixing these problems forced me to get acquainted with programming The Key, and I’m glad I did. It opened up the full possibilities of this macro pad, which can do so much more than just copy and paste. The amount of commands QMK supports &lt;a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keycodes?id=keycodes-overview"&gt;is a little mind boggling&lt;/a&gt;, and you can even have one key perform multiple tasks using a modifier key. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYp_6ASI0WX9csMcNQ4yaaNnThY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938119/jporter_211018_4805_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eRjM4"&gt;So maybe you want to use The Key as a small trio of media playback controls (play / pause, skip forward, skip back) or for volume (volume up, volume down, mute). Or maybe you want to go even further and program each key to a macro, where each key can handle a series of button presses automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99Rn3X"&gt;That’s where I ended up after I decided to turn The Key into a Zoom shortcut macro pad, inspired in part by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/lanewinfield/zoomout"&gt;many DIY projects&lt;/a&gt; that emerged last year. Two of its buttons could handle turning my camera and microphone on and off respectively, and a third would quit the Zoom call entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o02fR4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, the copying and pasting works&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V3B15l"&gt;What’s nice is that as well as programming simple key combinations (Alt+V for the camera and Alt+A for the microphone), QMK also lets you program multiple stages. So as well as programming a button to hit the Alt+Q command to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; the process of exiting a Zoom meeting, I could also program it to follow up with a tap of the “Enter” key. So now my colleagues won’t have to see me stare awkwardly into the middle distance the next time I forget about Zoom’s confirmation dialog box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLBnBI"&gt;There are a lot of keyboards out there that already offer macro keys like this. Companies like Corsair and Logitech have long offered models with extra programmable buttons, and there are much fancier devices like Elgato’s $149.99 Stream Deck which include small displays on each key to let you customize their appearance as well as their function. But The Key costs just $29. It’s an affordable, and yet surprisingly flexible, alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUjUaF"&gt;There are some downsides to using The Key like this, but not many. First, as I alluded to above, there’s obviously no way to change the keycaps’ legends when you reprogram their commands. They’re nicely made PBT keycaps with legends printed on using dye sublimation, but whatever fancy functions you program them to perform, they’re going to look the same way. So your options are to commit their functions to memory, buy some more appropriate keycaps, or maybe stick on some ugly Post-it notes to keep track of what each key is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2T72g1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It can’t compete with a Stream Deck, but at $29 it doesn’t have to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GrTGaM"&gt;The second problem is that although &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Ftalk%2F93641%2Fhow-to-configure-stack-overflow-the-key-macropad%3Fsort%3Dvotes&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Drop’s instructions&lt;/a&gt; are straightforward, actually flashing the custom firmware to The Key is a little cumbersome. You have to unscrew the four screws on the underside of the board to expose the PCB inside, where you’ll find a physical button to press and put the keyboard into flashing mode. It’s fine if you’re planning on just setting up The Key once and then forgetting about it, but a little annoying if you want to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8Hojm"&gt;Finally, although I found &lt;a href="https://kbfirmware.com/"&gt;KBFirmware.com&lt;/a&gt; an intuitive way to remap The Key, I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that it’s technically end-of-life and hence there’s a risk of it being shut down. I tried using a different QMK configurator, &lt;a href="http://config.qmk.fm"&gt;Config.QMK.fm&lt;/a&gt;, to design a layout and got an error message saying it’s not compatible with the configuration files Drop has provided for The Key. When I asked Drop about this, it said it was actively working to fix the issue, and pointed me toward a complicated-looking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Ftalk%2F93641%2Fhow-to-configure-stack-overflow-the-key-macropad%2F2848184%3Futm_source%3Dlinkshare%26referer%3DBQTJ2K&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;community-made fix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-roieiqbfjWvMJVlSTH-vklnXlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938117/jporter_211018_4805_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port handles connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkPIz0"&gt;Out of the box The Key is a silly novelty. Copying and pasting is a task so common I imagine every computer user has committed it to muscle memory, and your keyboard’s existing Ctrl, C, and V keys are sitting right there underneath your left hand. Training yourself to reach for a separate keyboard is a pointless waste of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V19S3S"&gt;Which is why it’s great that Stack Overflow and Drop haven’t half-assed The Key, despite its silly novelty status. It’s not doing anything particularly new or original, but it’s well made, well documented, and incredibly flexible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74WAY1"&gt;The biggest problem with The Key at the moment is that it’s incredibly difficult to get hold of. Drop tells me it’s already sold out of an additional production run that’s due to ship in December, and although it’s got another run planned for next year, it declined to share more details than that. You can sign up to be notified when Drop has more available, but who knows when that’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qqb5wc"&gt;The Key isn’t going to be giving Elgato’s Stream Deck a run for its money, but if you’re craving a couple of extra media keys or macros after downsizing to a super compact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048109/fujitsu-happy-hacking-keyboard-professional-3-classic-hybrid-type-s-mechanical-ces-2020"&gt;Happy Hacking keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a pretty neat option. It just might be a while before Drop’s supply catches up with demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW2uyC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfkJv0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero’s Pro 6 highlights the latest early Black Friday sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQNG8tyvpA7-z-A8aO5_Vvjox3Q=/142x0:1678x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086066/dseifert_201213_4337_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyjO75"&gt;November has come roaring out of the gates with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;some strong deals&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; sales. It’s not every year that you can start buying holiday gifts and know you’re getting the best deals possible, even before we push the clocks back, but that’s what we’re looking at here with these discounts on Eero mesh routers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQeaUN"&gt;You can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-pack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-pack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack&lt;/a&gt; of Eero Pro 6 tri-band mesh Wi-Fi 6 routers at Amazon and Best Buy for all-time low prices. Eero mesh routers are popular for good reason. They offer one of the simplest and streamlined ways to bring a solid Wi-Fi connection to all corners of your house, regardless of its size or tricky layout. And, you can add more routers to your mesh Wi-Fi system later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1cFIn"&gt;When we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;reviewed the Eero Pro 6 line&lt;/a&gt;, we had mixed feelings about how “Pro” these models were at their high-end gigabit performance. Though, our primary complaint was how expensive they originally sell for, and these deals go a long way to rectify that. Plus, this is the model to get if you need to connect several devices, including wired Ethernet devices, since each router has two Ethernet ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MG51pH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YuKimY"&gt;For larger homes (up to 6,000 square feet, according to Eero’s spec sheet), a three-pack of the Pro 6 is just $449 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVkBgAVUXS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a full $150 off the usual price of $600. While it might sound like overkill to go for a three-pack if you don’t own a small mansion, keep in mind the layout of your house. The multiple nodes can help if your home has a bit more of an oblong-shaped floor plan, like a ranch-style that is longer in one direction, or if the routers’ signal needs to pass through several walls or a floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="isICaI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9624413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="My5p7A"&gt;Don’t own a giant house, or you’re rocking the apartment life? Don’t worry — we did not forget about you. The Eero Pro 6 one-pack is also on sale. It’s just $171 at Amazon and Best Buy, compared to its usual $229. It’s not a bad idea to start out with just one since you can always add more routers to the system later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vdghbt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10843446"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpaonM"&gt;Another great selection of deals for today is Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23602414011&amp;amp;ref=dx_early_gd_dcl_tlt_2_3e381fc9_dt_sl5_b3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday sale on Philips Hue smart lighting&lt;/a&gt;. This one is just for today, and it offers some exceptional prices for color or white bulbs. You can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of color bulbs for $80&lt;/a&gt;, a big discount off its full price of $135. This is a great price for Hue bulbs, and they can adjust to nearly any color you desire — great for accent lighting in lamps or even as the main bulbs for the room. They don’t come with a bridge to connect them via your local network, but they are controllable via Bluetooth with the Philips Hue app. The Hue ecosystem is expansive, so you can always add more to it. This is a great pack to get started or to further build out your repertoire of smart bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="562gLm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649409"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fvTQp2"&gt;If you prefer more fine-tuned control through the Hue smartphone app or even via a wall-mount switch, the Philips Hue white LED smart button kit is another option to consider. These bulbs cannot take on every color of the rainbow, but they can be adjusted from a relaxing warm white to an energizing bright white. This kit comes with the bridge hub, so you can expand the system and use more smart functionality through the app. The included smart button can mount to a wall, without any wiring, to control the lights smartphone-free. This is a lot of functionality and convenience for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Starter-HomeKit-Assistant/dp/B07XC2CXKK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80, on sale just for today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSPZXd"&gt;There is one more Hue deal at Amazon to consider, pairing this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Button-Bluetooth-Lightstrip/dp/B09783J3Q4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smart button kit with a Bluetooth smart light strip for $144&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There will never be another Pokémon Go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pokemon go mewtwo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1x-ruaq0G00_JYaTuR8fwG7Lq_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085713/DSCF5354.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NSrbkL"&gt;Creating a follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is an impossible task. The game was the kind of breakout success that had never been seen before — and might never happen again; it’s hard to overstate how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15888210/pokemon-go-one-year-anniversary-timeline"&gt;the game was absolutely &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; when it first launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. People were trespassing to catch Squirtles as the game set App Store download records. The wish fulfillment that came from seeing pokémon in the real world created a sensation that, even years after its peak, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;remains one of the biggest games in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZBrOq"&gt;It was only natural that developer Niantic would try to follow that with something new. But re-creating the lightning in a bottle that is &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t gone quite as planned, despite Niantic snapping up some enviable properties to adapt. After a year of early access, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan: Settlers&lt;/em&gt; will shut down later this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;which launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t fare much better: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759677/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shutting-down-january-2022-niantic-ar"&gt;the game is closing down next January&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not just Niantic, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;Microsoft also had little success with the short-lived &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560776/the-witcher-monster-slayer-ar-mobile-ios-android-game"&gt;A monster-hunting &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; game debuted in the summer to little acclaim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhuSdN"&gt;The obvious answer is that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was a fluke and that real-world, augmented reality games don’t have much of a future beyond catching pocket monsters. But there might be another reason for the string of failed releases: everyone is aiming too high.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fKhxiIyxdg7C33CpizqbHyU717Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16501474/cgartenberg_190621_3508_3530.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Utyid4"&gt;Two things can be true. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is a once-in-a-lifetime hit that will never be replicated, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; location-based AR games have a future beyond it. You don’t need to look much further than Niantic’s latest release, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, to see that potential future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwA7fo"&gt;Whereas &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; both seemed like an attempt to create the next big thing, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; is much less ambitious. To start, it’s barely a game at all. &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is more of an app designed to encourage walking by making it more playful. I’ve been using it for around a week, and it’s more like pleasant background noise than an immersive game. You collect pikmin and fruit to feed them by going out for walks, and you can also grow new creatures by, you guessed it, walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3aCl"&gt;It’s a simple sort of gamification that adds just that little bit of extra incentive to head out of the house. It also has some charming Nintendo-esque touches (the game was co-developed by Nintendo and Niantic’s Tokyo studio), like the way you wave goodbye to your pikmin when they go out on expeditions or the scrapbook-like journal the game creates each day to remind you what you did. The simplicity of &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is what makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RszDen"&gt;As live service games have become more dominant, they’ve also run into an issue: players only have so much free time. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; may be massive ongoing hits, but they also leave little room for other similar games. The same is true for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;-style real-world games. The current iteration of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is surprisingly demanding; it requires going out to gyms to battle and navigating the tricky world of raising the strongest possible pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4rGvv4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFdpE3UHxzY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZS1zqh"&gt;Players have latched onto that, and many are willing to invest what &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; asks. They’ve been doing it for years at this point. But it’s also clear that other AR games aren’t able to capture the same level of attention. You can’t just take the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; formula and tack it on to another fictional world, even one as popular as &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;. If you could, we wouldn’t have this deluge of games shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECB16w"&gt;Which is what makes &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; so clever. It’s unassuming and demands little from you; it’s even set in one of Nintendo’s more niche fictional worlds. But the app also utilizes many of the things that made &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; such a success. The real-world integration gives you an excuse to venture a little further on a walk, so you can sow a few more flowers. The pikmin-planting mechanic encourages extra steps since walking helps make them grow. And then there’s the AR component, which lets you see what the cute, colorful plant creatures look like crawling around your living room or hanging out in a local park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xnkGA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; isn’t destined to be the next mainstream hit. It’s unlikely that we’ll see it create a deluge of memes and local news reports. Instead, it posits a much more realistic future for location-based AR games — one where a few small apps fit neatly into your life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Indiegogo switches gears to more closely screen crowdfunding campaigns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5mw5soWy9YDKHF8tx9ZQWGva3fw=/0x271:1080x991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085536/logo_lockup_white.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Indiegogo and GoFundMe have partnered to form the Crowdfunding Trust Alliance | Indiegogo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VYsa4f"&gt;Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo is changing the way it does business, shifting from an open platform where anyone can raise money for just about any purpose to a closed model where every campaign will receive a manual review before it can go live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4J3gCo"&gt;“Candidly, we have not always lived up to our backers’ expectations,” said Will Haines, vice president of product and customer trust at Indiegogo. When the company launched in 2008, there were few restrictions on would-be entrepreneurs seeking to raise money from like-minded backers. But Haines says that “open” isn’t what the crowdfunding community really wants now, more than a decade later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8KnkW"&gt;“Crowdfunding is not shopping — people generally understand that now — but it also shouldn’t be a leap in the dark,” he said. Backers count on the platform to be a safe and trusted space, Haines said. But, he added, “the risk has to be worth it, and backers need the tools to make an informed decision.” In addition to reviewing campaigns before they can launch, the company plans to work more closely with the entrepreneurs behind a campaign to ensure they have a solid plan and enough knowledge to bring their product or idea to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d72QKS"&gt;The new approach is being used on a small number of campaigns and will be rolled out more widely in the coming months, the company said. Indiegogo also has created an internal review board to oversee and evaluate the riskiest campaigns on its platform, as determined by its community of backers. The board can take action ranging from banning campaign owners from launching new campaigns, sending campaign owners to collections, and reporting them to law enforcement if necessary. Such actions would be reserved for campaigns Indiegogo believed to be working under “malintent” and if the company doesn’t hear back from a campaign owner after several attempts to contact them or failure to comply with its terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2DIuW"&gt;Haines said that Indiegogo’s mission at launch was to create a global network, where a community of entrepreneurs and enthusiasts could bring ideas to life. Built into that ethos was a negative perception of gatekeepers, Haines said. “Our biggest asset is the crowd, the people willing to take on some level of risk.” The company said between 2010 and 2020, Indiegogo contributions — the money backers give to campaigns — have grown by 5,515 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hhKfLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“... the thing you ultimately receive is not going to be exactly the sketch on the napkin.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVyXn3"&gt;Entrepreneurs, however — especially those seeking to raise money — have been incentivized to oversell their ideas and present them as groundbreaking or revolutionary, a mindset with which most crowdfunding backers are unlikely to be familiar. That can create something of a gap in understanding between the two sides. “Our job is to identify what’s needed to fill that gap, to make sure backers understand what the gap is,” Haines said. “What I see as the holy grail for us moving forward is not to remove all the risk but be clear about the level of risk. If you want to get in on something when it’s a sketch on a napkin, you should recognize that the thing you ultimately receive is not going to be exactly the sketch on the napkin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvkXvr"&gt;As part of its efforts toward cracking down on fraudulent campaigns, Indiegogo has partnered with fellow crowdfunding platform GoFundMe to create a new entity to establish best practices for the crowdfunding industry and to weed out bad actors who defraud well-meaning backers of crowdfunding campaigns. The companies describe the Crowdfunding Trust Alliance as a way for platforms to work collectively toward the goal of creating “clear trust and safety standards for the industry as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn8ZOV"&gt;The two companies haven’t yet invited Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform, to join the alliance, but an Indiegogo spokesperson said both companies want any reputable crowdfunding platforms involved and “absolutely encourage [Kickstarter] to join.” The founding members of the alliance will be reaching out to other platforms in the near future, the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk09Q5"&gt;It’s a bit of a shift for an industry that has largely disclaimed responsibility if a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21156136/ibackpack-smart-backpack-kickstarter-indiegogo-crowdfunding-scam-investigation-ftc-doug-monahan"&gt;campaign fails to deliver on its promises&lt;/a&gt;; they’re just the conduit, the platforms have maintained, and any crowdfunding backer assumes a certain amount of risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnLdBs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A high-profile failure reflects on the whole industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvDm2e"&gt;Under the terms of the new alliance, organizations won’t share confidential information, and third-party vendors won’t be allowed to join. To be eligible, an organization has to be well-established — at least three years old — and “generally respected” within the industry. Alliance members must unanimously approve any new applicants. So details about specific campaigns or campaign organizers wouldn’t be up for discussion, but members might share best practices to handle certain trust and safety situations they encounter, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8Lwvn"&gt;There’s good reason for crowdfunding as an industry to tighten oversight of people who would use their platforms for nefarious purposes; a well-publicized scam on one platform creates wariness among potential backers for any future crowdfunding effort. “A high-profile failure reflects on the whole industry,” Haines said. “It’s in all of our best interests that platforms are reputable.” He added that he doesn’t think it’s necessary to have every crowdfunding platform on board with the new alliance, but he’d be happy to see a larger reduction in scams. “If there’s nowhere for the fraudsters to go, that’s fantastic,” he said. “I want to get there.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zLBk2k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“... a lot of the bad folks collaborate pretty well”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eqiJp"&gt;Juan Benitez, president of GoFundMe, said working with other platforms will be key for reducing crowdfunding fraud across the board. “And I’ll be quite honest, you know, a lot of the bad folks collaborate pretty well,” he said. “So I think it’s very important for the platforms to collaborate and have sharing of best practices, technology and resources.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz4TuF"&gt;Benitez added that GoFundMe would welcome more members of the crowdfunding industry to join the new alliance. “That just collectively helps us all be stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFcNfp"&gt;In addition to expanding globally over the past decade, crowdfunding platforms have also evolved to include much more personal campaigns for things like medical bills or funeral costs. Benitez says he has found the variety of situations that people can be involved in to be striking. “It’s so amazing, and frankly energizing, for GoFundMe to be able to create a place where people can engage on those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqZ0VS"&gt;In a blog post &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@gofundme/39fe4c9125a0"&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; the alliance with Indiegogo, Benitez described the aftermath of the June building collapse in Surfside, Florida that killed 98 people. Many people wanted to donate to help the families of the victims, and many scammers were lined up to take advantage of that generosity, Benitez wrote. But the company was able to identify and remove 23 suspicious fundraisers before they could raise any money. Campaigns the company verified raised $2.4 million to help the Surfside families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZP1Ob"&gt;While scammers in crowdfunding get a lot of the spotlight, Benitez said the focus for GoFundMe remains on building a trustworthy and safe platform. “The reality is the vast, vast majority of activity on our platform is all good people trying to do good things and trying to help each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9lMOa"&gt;Haines says that in addition to creating more transparency about how crowdfunding campaigns are run, he sees Indiegogo playing more of a role in helping entrepreneurs on its platform be more successful overall, acting as a kind of coach. “Some campaigns don’t ever raise any money,” he noted. “But we want to focus our attention on where the backers are, because that’s where the risk is, and where the money is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19prAG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The air quality monitor (right) can show information on Echo Show devices. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3EZce"&gt;Amazon’s latest smart home device is the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/how-alexa-can-help-you-create-a-smarter-healthier-home"&gt;$69.99 Smart Air Quality Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a small puck around half the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;latest Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to keep an eye on the quality of the air in your home. It can track your home’s temperature and humidity, and the presence of dust, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc9d5A"&gt;A key selling point of the Smart Air Quality Monitor is its Alexa integration. It lets you ask compatible Alexa-enabled devices for an update on the air quality of the home at any time or view trends via the Alexa app or an Echo Show device. Importantly, the Smart Air Quality Monitor’s temperature sensor can also integrate with Alexa Routines. That allows it to function as a trigger for things like smart thermostats, ceiling fans, and blinds to help control a room’s temperature. If there’s a problem, it can issue warnings via Echo devices or the Alexa app to let you know you might, for example, want to open a window.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HO4GS0Y9rSRSDa0bMgUdhcKj_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982161/Amazon_Smart_Air_Quality_Monitor_Side_View_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device itself is fairly unassuming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQB5Cz"&gt;Outside of the Alexa integration, one of the biggest appeals of the Smart Air Quality Monitor is its relatively affordable price. It’s cheaper than the $89 Awair Glow C air quality sensing smart plug &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707146/awair-glow-c-smart-plug-air-sensor-nightlight-combo-review-price-specs-features"&gt;we tried out in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and almost half the price of &lt;a href="https://www.netatmo.com/en-us/aircare/homecoach"&gt;Netatmo’s popular Smart Indoor Air Quality Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which usually retails for $119.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qn6SyQ"&gt;Air quality is an increasing area of focus of smart home manufacturers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/6/17083908/dyson-pure-cool-air-purifier-cyclone-v10-cordless-vacuum-announcement"&gt;Dyson’s latest fans&lt;/a&gt; include air filters to remove pollutants like smoke or pollen, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623397/google-nest-hubs-air-pollution-smoke-alert-feature"&gt;Google updated its Nest Hubs&lt;/a&gt; in parts of the US to show data on outdoor air quality. Even Ikea’s gotten in on the action with a smart air purifier that’s built into, of all things, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fnew%2Fdiscover-a-smarter-way-to-clear-the-air-with-starkvind-air-purifiers-pub4c72a520&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F3%2F22761003%2Famazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a side table&lt;/a&gt;, and it offers a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fvindriktning-air-quality-sensor-60515911%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F3%2F22761003%2Famazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standalone air quality sensor&lt;/a&gt;. The ideal smart home has traditionally been one that’s well-lit and efficiently heated, but increasingly it’s one with good air quality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TZV1e"&gt;Amazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor is available to preorder today in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK for $69.99 / £69.99 / €79.99 and is scheduled to ship in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GE wants you to trust its smart oven to cook the perfect turkey </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIFR-w2lDUN7AU9iszeZoLJRnYU=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085558/kriech_higdon_photo_9231.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Turkey Mode coming to GE’s Wi-Fi connected ovens and ranges this week promises to cook the perfect turkey&lt;/em&gt; | IMAGE: Kriech-Higdon Photography&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SjT25"&gt;The smart kitchen is getting a little more intelligent this holiday season. Appliance manufacturer GE Appliances has a new Turkey Mode for its smart ovens that promises to take the prep and guesswork out of roasting that big bird. It arrives on over half a million GE connected ovens and ranges this week via an over-the-air software upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNqBos"&gt;The Kentucky-based GE Appliances gave me a demo of the new tech, and it’s pretty impressive. You put the bird in the roasting tin, pop it in a cold oven, insert the temperature probe built into the oven, push the Turkey Mode button (either on the LCD screen of the oven or in the GE SmartHQ smartphone app), and sit back and relax. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/na-H_1AqYxMPED30ECZeuYpIhsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982371/kriech_higdon_photo_2_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kriech-Higdon Photography&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GE Appliances says cooking a turkey in its smart ovens will be as easy as insert probe and push Turkey Mode this holiday season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Org2"&gt;There is no basting, stuffing, brining, fiddling with foil, preheating, or panicking about whether it’s over or undercooked. And most importantly, there is no math; whether the bird is 12lbs or 20lbs, Turkey Mode calculates the cook time and executes its cooking algorithms to bring the bird to 170 degrees a few hours later. And if you want to, you can monitor the turkey and temperature in real time through the app or LCD screen. When it’s ready, the oven timer will go “Gobble, gobble.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NpTF5N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it’s ready, the oven timer will go “Gobble, gobble.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YeVOSb"&gt;Sabrina Hannah, a food scientist at GE Appliances, explained that her team cooked hundreds of turkeys to perfect the algorithms, and she’s confident your turkey will turn out just as perfectly juicy and crispy as the one they showed me in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6UeATVbCrhohPva0ouIvIXNiI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982383/Turkey_Mode_UPDATE_noticeLCD_FLOW.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GE Appliances&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkey Mode is part of GE Appliances smart oven’s Precision Cooking programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYkCKw"&gt;The Turkey Mode feature will be available in a total of 336 GE ovens, including Monogram, Café, GE Profile, and GE models. It’s part of GE Appliances Precision Cooking program available on its smart ovens that guides cooking everything from cakes and cookies to salmon and beef tenderloin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY39yF"&gt;Manufacturers are still struggling to convince people to buy smart versions of their large kitchen appliances. But innovations such as this one — and GE Appliances’ recent over-the-air update to add an air fryer mode to its ovens — help provide reasons to consider the upgrade next time you’re appliance shopping. An oven that gets new, helpful features like Turkey Mode after you’ve bought it is pretty smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jc3f3k"&gt;It can be difficult to figure out what to do when you’re asked to provide a hard copy of a document but don’t have access to a printer at home. While it used to be a safe bet that everyone had a printer at home, that’s no longer the case — but if you don’t have one, odds are that at some point, you’ll come across someone who hasn’t gotten the memo and insists on a hard copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0HN35"&gt;If you’ve found yourself in this situation, you’ve got options. To help, I’ve researched the various methods you can use to get a document from your computer to whoever needs it and have come up with a few tips and considerations for printing without your own printer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0mqi9"&gt;Before I get to that, though, you’ll have to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4UiFG3"&gt;Prepare to print&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h5BMec"&gt;Presumably, the file you want to print is on a computer, and you need some way to get it from there to another computer connected to a printer. Depending on what method you use, you may be able to upload your file to the internet and have it printed at a specific location (some services can even connect straight to cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox). If the printer — or the organization that owns the printer — doesn’t support uploads from the internet, you may have to put your file on a flash drive, probably one with a USB-A connector. If you’re unsure whether the place you’re going to accepts online files, check ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8zT9q"&gt;As for what kind of files you can print, different services support different file types. In my inquiries, Microsoft Word’s .docx and Adobe’s PDF formats were universally accepted, so that’s probably the way to go if you’re trying to print out text. If your Word document includes a lot of custom formatting, fonts, and / or images, you may want to export it as a PDF first to make sure it prints exactly how you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRODW6"&gt;After you’ve got that squared away, here are some of your options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nzFICX"&gt;Print at the library or school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQqtE"&gt;If you’re a student or have access to a public library, you can likely print documents there for free or at a low cost per page. There will probably be instructions for how to print something out on your institution’s website, or you can always ask a librarian for help. I was able to upload my document to the internet and then print it for free at any of my local library’s branches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3F01j"&gt;It’s worth noting that you probably won’t want to print out documents with sensitive content or personal info at these sorts of places — for one, you’ll likely be printing them from an unfamiliar web portal using an unfamiliar computer. It’s possible your school will let you print straight from your own laptop, but in any case, you’ll be printing on a network you don’t control, which means there’s some level of risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jaP8h"&gt;If the printer isn’t located close to the computer, there’s also always the possibility that someone else could have access to your document after it comes out of the printer, depending on how the library is set up. If you need to print medical documents or the like, you may want to look into other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XwVh4l"&gt;Ask a friend or family member&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PMxZPZ"&gt;If you’re only going to be printing a page or two and have family members or friends who own a printer, it’s always worth asking them if you can use it. This can help avoid the privacy concerns that can come with printing using public hardware. While it may not be the best method if you want to print off an entire novel (unless you’re willing to repay their generosity by bringing your own paper and possibly an ink cartridge, depending on how many pages you’re doing), it could work for the occasional times when you need a hard copy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5BEpnI6syqyqOwZCyQ2j4Lkv74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22976488/2017_06_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shipping stores often also offer printing services for big and small jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l402O4"&gt;Go to a business center like UPS or FedEx&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W44t4j"&gt;Shipping centers often provide printing services, too, whether for large jobs, like making a poster or banner, or for more mundane tasks, like printing out permission slips or routine forms. Some stores are branded specifically as print or business centers, but even ones that aren’t will likely be able to print out a few pages for you. There’ll be a cost associated with it, based on how many pages you print out — I paid $0.12 for a single-sided, black-and-white page at a local UPS store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvRUoD"&gt;Again — and somewhat surprisingly, given that these stores are business-oriented — this option may not be the best for sensitive documents. At the aforementioned UPS location, the printing process involved emailing an attachment to the store, which the employee would then open and print before handing me the resulting paper. It may be different at other stores and locations, but you’ll probably want to check before you make the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dv0GXI"&gt;Ask if you can print at work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F1WJc2"&gt;If you work in an office that has printers, and there aren’t strict rules around how they’re used, it may be worth asking your boss or IT department if you can use them to print a personal document or two. The worst that can happen is that they say no, and you may be surprised with a yes. I wouldn’t, however, recommend taking the “ask forgiveness rather than permission” approach, as many workplace printers are monitored for appropriate use (and the IT department can track whose computer each print job came from). In addition, you don’t want to get scolded (or worse) over a print job when there are other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZAXEN"&gt;Privacy is also a factor here — along with potential IT monitoring, the printer will likely be in a public area, and it’s possible that someone could end up picking up your documents by accident if they’re also using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QbOGs9"&gt;Pick up a print at an office supply store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="59SfV3"&gt;Stores like &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeHowToPrint110221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fservices%2Fprinting%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.officedepot.com%2Fa%2Fbrowse%2Fdocument-printing%2FN%3D5%2B1212282%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22737500%2Fprint-document-how-to-laser-inkjet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Office Depot&lt;/a&gt; (or an independent, local print shop) often give you the option to order printed documents online, then pick them up in person. While their websites’ printing service pages may be covered with splashy brochures and posters, you can also just order &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeHowToPrint110221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fservices%2Fprinting%2Fcopies-documents-printing%2Fsimple-prints%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regular printed documents as well&lt;/a&gt;. Both the stores I checked let me upload my document online and then pick it up the same day. They even offered to ship the documents to my house for an extra fee, though that wouldn’t necessarily be an economical option for printing a single document or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqQFXX"&gt;One of the benefits of using an office supply store is the range of options you get — you can print in color, for example, and choose what size and weight of paper you want to use (so you can, say, impress a prospective employer with a finely-printed hard-copy resumé). Depending on what tier of printing you are getting (some stores have “basic” and “professional” printing services), you can also pay to have your document stapled, hole-punched, laminated, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVDf4kWiAms1RYYyZvHzmJOTa-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960551/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.28.55.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Office Depot offered several options for customizing my print job, many of which would’ve been over-the-top for a single page but good for mass-printing documents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ivdnzt"&gt;That flexibility may extend to how you get your prints made as well. The Staples location I went to also offered self-service printing, where you could walk in and do the printing yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOhpnR"&gt;The downside is cost — printing a single simple page at Staples was $0.19, and printing a color, stapled, 10-page document on premium “cotton resume white” paper would cost $7.42. A similar print job at Office Depot would be $7.03. Switching to black and white substantially lowered the price, down to $3.27 and $2.93, respectively, so it’s definitely worth choosing that option if color isn’t important for your document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksIQ9U"&gt;While there are discounts available if you’re printing a ton of copies, it could be worth looking around to see if you could find less expensive options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-b8ddsuO2E5uSNVcBDhJWcuUoo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965177/6454282ld.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G6NxSL"&gt;Buy an inexpensive printer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QkjpWm"&gt;The solutions above can be great if you only have to print occasionally or if the locations are part of your everyday routine. But if you find that you have to go out of your way to print things more often than you’d like, and your space and budget allow for it, you may want to get an inexpensive printer. That could &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-DeskJet-2742e-All-in-One-Wireless-Color-Inkjet-Printer-Cinnamon-6-Months-Free-Instant-Ink-with-HP%2F236589360&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHowToPrint110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost anywhere from $60&lt;/a&gt; (or less if you can find a sale) for a basic wireless inkjet all-in-one (meaning it can also scan and copy) to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfU0egkQXci" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over $100 for a black-and-white laser printer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyaUzX"&gt;Inkjet printers will be cheaper and will be able to print in color, but the ink can be shockingly expensive. Refilling my $60 example printer’s ink &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-67-Black-Original-Ink-3YM56AN%2F640484654&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHowToPrint110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will cost you $30,&lt;/a&gt; and HP estimates that you’ll only get around 100 pages of printing from those cartridges. Replacing a laser printer’s toner is less expensive per page (my example’s refill &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfU0fgRPVNZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $50&lt;/a&gt;, but HP estimates you’ll get 1,000 pages out of it), and laser printers could be a better option for infrequent printers, as their toner won’t dry out as quickly as regular ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MYoln"&gt;If you’re looking for a guide on buying a printer, we have one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279634/best-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can check out here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ToLlfu"&gt;Do you need a hard copy at all? It’s a good idea to ask. Some people or organizations may be willing to accept an electronically signed document, or you may have the option to use a digital pass instead of a printed one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXAlS"&gt;There will definitely be times when you’ll absolutely need a hard copy, but in a lot of situations, it may be worth checking to see if a digital version will work.

    <title>Waymo is bringing its autonomous vehicles to New York City for (manually driven) mapping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJk-3T-wNCKNAXPnINz7YHYXutI=/127x0:1474x898/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085218/O0CtGcQE53rLMZODMK_XXR4sEcsD73_ZALIzuuhdA8Rv_XdvjlUgAraW_KzZ0W7he97FRwrbUjdA9K65kh6OqW7IXHNYaPUnz6_Klq2c1c3Wz4GioI7WdAutNZd2d1PsxDgZebJSRQ.5.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8dfA5r"&gt;The latest autonomous vehicle company to tackle the mean streets of New York City will be Waymo. The Google spinoff is bringing a handful of cars to the Big Apple, where they will start mapping the city streets using manually driven vehicles with two people riding inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qul4g"&gt;Waymo cited New York’s vibrant street life, “unusual road geometries” (which is a nice way of saying utterly confusing), and the likelihood of heavy rain and snow as being among the reasons the company is eager to test there. Presumedly the company is also curious to see how its vehicles will react when down-on-their-luck street hustlers slap their hoods and shout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z-tCU-sULA"&gt;“I’m walking here!”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ndLN0"&gt;Waymo won’t have more than five vehicles on the street at a time to start out, a spokesperson said. They will be driving in Manhattan, primarily south of Central Park, and eventually extending down through the city to the financial district and also out to a small section of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel. The fleet will consist of Chrysler Pacifica minivans, equipped with high-powered sensors and computing units, at first. Later they will include the company’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lEHfc4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear when the cars will begin to drive in autonomous mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPJm7H"&gt;It’s not clear when the cars will begin to drive in autonomous mode. But New York City is obviously a huge, complex stage on which Waymo is eager to demonstrate the effectiveness of its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvD9Rm"&gt;New York City also has some of &lt;a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/06/30/new-york-city-worst-traffic-in-the-country/"&gt;the most dangerous, congested, and poorly managed streets&lt;/a&gt; in the world. They are also chock-full of construction workers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and double- and sometimes even triple-parked cars. In theory, this would make it very difficult for an autonomous vehicle to navigate, given that AVs typically rely on good weather, clear signage, and less aggressive driving from other road users for safe operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqMaTA"&gt;While other states have become hot beds for AV testing, New York has been a bit of a ghost town. Part of the reason could be the state’s strict rules, which include mandating that safety drivers keep their hands on the wheel at all times and requiring state police escort at all times to be paid for by the testing company — though the state hasn’t enforced the latter requirement in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIQnty"&gt;A spokesperson for Waymo said its operations “do not meet NY’s current definition for testing and are therefore not subject to permitting requirements.” The company has proactively reached out to “relevant lawmakers,” including Governor Kathy Hochul, about its plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLADIj"&gt;Waymo says it has been in contact with “many New York policymakers, regulators, industry leaders, and non-profit groups to get their feedback, and we’re encouraged by the responses.” The company provided a quote from Eric Adams, who was just elected mayor, declaring himself “excited” to host Waymo’s small fleet of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3YbLr"&gt;Of course, many residents believe that New York City doesn’t need more cars — it needs fewer. Congestion in the city is arguably worse than ever, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/01/dont-walk-this-way-58-more-nyc-pedestrians-killed-in-2021/"&gt;pedestrian deaths are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and the city’s leaders have done little to stem the chaos. Waymo says its cars are safer, but they’re still cars that occupy the same amount of space as human-driven vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEoOvV"&gt;Waymo won’t be the first company to attempt to navigate New York City’s unique brand of vehicular chaos. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16488330/gm-cruise-nyc-self-driving-car-test-cuomo"&gt;GM-backed Cruise announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to test its self-driving vehicles in lower Manhattan, but &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/gms-plan-to-test-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-city-seems-1828945330"&gt;those plans were later scuttled&lt;/a&gt; with little explanation as to why. Boston-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20755163/new-york-city-self-driving-shuttle-service"&gt;Optimus Ride has been testing autonomous shuttles in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, but only on private roads as part of the borough’s Navy Yard. Mobileye, a division of Intel, also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585338/intel-mobileye-autonomous-vehicle-av-testing-nyc"&gt;began testing its vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in the city. Meanwhile, operators flocked to places with friendlier regulations (like Arizona) or ones that are more convenient to their headquarters (like California).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFi6l2"&gt;Waymo is operating a robotaxi service in Phoenix, some of which include completely driverless vehicles. It’s also testing its vehicles in San Francisco, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702962/cruise-waymo-california-dmv-autonomous-vehicle-permit"&gt;recently received&lt;/a&gt; permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to offer rides to passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thaer6"&gt;But in order to give rides to paying passengers in its fully driverless vehicles, as it does in Arizona, the Google spinoff would need to apply for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591045/california-robotaxi-paid-rides-cpuc-permits"&gt;additional permit from the California Public Utilities Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has a number of vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903034/waymo-self-driving-test-la-mds-data"&gt;in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; performing a similar task as they will in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFPiem"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Eternals is big, beautiful, and empty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nGD3QseZ9t46Bvv7wIjIOsxyDPk=/6x0:8466x5640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085295/SLH_16959_R_CROP.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sophie Mutevelian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Marvel’s epoch-spanning epic has too many heroes but still feels empty&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oHojHO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is Marvel’s biggest swing in years. It’s an attempt at a prestige-style film directed by Chloé Zhao, fresh off her Oscar win, at a size and scale that none of Marvel’s previous films have tried. But despite its grand ambitions, the film gets lost in its ponderous ideas and caught in the constraining box of what an MCU film has to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4LESR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; aspires to an almost biblical scope. The opening crawl of the film (yes, there is an opening crawl) reads like an early page of the Book of Genesis, explaining who Arishem, the Prime Celestial, brought light to the universe. The film bounds across thousands of years of human history, has no less than 10 main characters, four villains, a love quadrangle, and even Marvel’s first on-screen sex scene. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2AkKhL_wMPdNbwBlpLZqD2otbc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980788/TBB1100_comp_v044.1129.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals has a galactic scale, to mixed effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FMaq02"&gt;The basic plot of &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is as follows: for thousands of years, a team of immortal superheroes — the eponymous Eternals — has been living in secret amongst humanity on Earth, sent by the god-like Celestials to help nurture mankind and protect them from the villainous Deviants. The Eternals have spent centuries hidden among humanity, their epic feats mistaken for mythological gods. (But, as the film explains, the Eternals were &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; allowed to protect against Deviants, hence their absence in the many, many world- and universe-threatening crises of the previous MCU films.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1MNGuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a lot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuZ2U"&gt;The core Eternals team is comprised of 10 main characters, each with their own special powers: Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transmute objects to different elements; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who basically is a Marvel-ized Superman with flight and laser eyes; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can fire energy blasts from his hands; Sprite (Lia McHugh), who can cast illusions; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a superhuman inventor; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has super speed; Druig (Barry Keoghan), with mind control powers; Gilgamesh (Don Lee) with super strength, and Thena (Angelina Jolie), a powerful warrior who can summon weapons from thin air. Leading the bunch is Ajak (Salma Hayek), the “Prime Eternal,” who possesses healing powers and can commune with Arishem as a sort of priest/mother for the rest of the Eternals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hy3hB"&gt;If that feels like a lot, it’s because it is. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; does its best to introduce the characters, along with their relationships, powers, and goals, but it’s a lot of backstory to cram into the two-and-a-half-plus-hour film. (That makes it the second-longest MCU movie to date, after the three-hour &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame.&lt;/em&gt;) By default, some of the Eternals are more “main” characters than others: Cersei and Ikaris get a lot of time to hash out their relationship, while Phastos and Makkari are effectively side characters. Nanjiani’s Kingo does the best to steal the show — his character has spent his centuries on Earth building a Bollywood dynasty — but he still gets sidelined a lot in favor of the more central characters.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed7x9d2hU18c4LwXe2t50MgHY7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980795/DCA3100_comp_v006_046585.1097_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Some of the many main characters in Eternals&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpHm2t"&gt;It’s not that Marvel movies can’t handle this many characters. The jam-packed Avengers films, or even the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, are testaments to the studio’s talent at coherently cramming dozens of heroes into a single film. But &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; has an uphill battle that starts with the fact that we’re meeting all these characters for the first time despite Marvel’s 20-plus films and shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhlKPr"&gt;All of this would be fine if the Eternals were actually doing interesting things. But the first half of the film consists largely of showing us how the Eternals drifted apart 6,500 years into their mission of hunting Deviants and a “getting the band back together” sequence of slowly reassembling the team to battle the resurgent Deviant threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hl3ru3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; constantly bounces between not having enough and too many things going on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2WSyt"&gt;A mid-movie lore dump helps kickstart an actual plot, but even that consists more of different combinations of Eternals standing around and arguing over a cosmic-scale trolley problem. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is constantly bouncing around between not having enough going on and suddenly having too much to be concerned about. One of &lt;em&gt;Eternals’&lt;/em&gt; antagonists doesn’t appear until nearly two hours in. Another persistently shows up in the movie but isn’t even given a name on-screen. A key character simply opts out of the third-act fight sequence entirely, unremarked by any other characters until returning out of thin air for the film’s conclusion. And of course, Marvel can’t help itself from hamfistedly setting up future sequels and spinoffs in Eternal’s cliffhanger ending and post-credit scenes (of which there are two, both of which feel more like moments to elicit gasps from comic book fans than any real concrete teaser).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ry1xhD"&gt;For all its flaws in plot and pacing, Eternals is a beautifully shot movie. A lot has already been made about &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/directors/chloe-zhao-oscars-nomadland-marvel-eternals-dracula-1234961719/"&gt;director Chloé Zhao’s insistence&lt;/a&gt; at shooting much of the film in actual, real-world locations instead of the MCU’s characteristic green screen sets, and the difference is clear. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ dusty deserts, clouded beaches, and lush rainforests feel &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in a way that the CGI landscapes often don’t, with soaring views and sunsets lending a tangibility to the more fantastical goings-on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IA3E5r"&gt;The requisite fight scenes are also great; the Eternals put together its toy box of complementary powers to fun effect, and the golden curlicues that are used as the visual shorthand for everyone’s powers are a nice change from Marvel’s typical color-coded energy blobs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5t10pG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Marvel’s most diverse film yet (although the bar is exceedingly low)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zn56s"&gt;Eternals is also Marvel’s most diverse film by far, a bar that, while being so low as to be easily stepped over, is still an achievement to note, belated as it is in the studio’s decade-plus-long run. It is legitimately refreshing to see a wider range of actors on screen beyond the cadre of Chrises, even if the much-hyped debut of Brian Tyree Henry’s gay hero practically feels shot in a way to make it as easy as possible to excise for overseas box office requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICx8aJ"&gt;Ultimately, though, Eternals tries to be too much — and it suffers for it. The film’s lofty goal of being a creation myth for the Marvel universe has potential, but it’s far too much to cram into the constraints of a modern superhero film. It’s no use seeing where these heroes came from if we don’t have enough time to care about who they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
