    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;TikTok on the clock but the party don’t stop&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="l64zu1"&gt;On July 7th, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, told Fox News &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21316062/tiktok-ban-app-mike-pompeo-government-china-bytedance-communist-party"&gt;he was considering a ban on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese-owned app best known for dancing teenagers, roller skating, and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-10-02/nathan-apodaca-is-the-skateboarding-fleetwood-mac-loving-tiktok-star-that-2020-needs"&gt;Fleetwood Mac enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;. You should only use TikTok “if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjhKOO"&gt;All hell promptly broke loose. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320196/amazon-employees-tiktok-uninstall-email-trump-administration-pompeo-ban"&gt;Amazon banned and then unbanned&lt;/a&gt; TikTok from employees’ phones; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/11/21320935/wells-fargo-bans-tiktok-devices-amazon-pompeo"&gt;Wells Fargo asked employees to remove TikTok&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;phones; and the &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/dnc-warning-tiktok/"&gt;Democratic and Republican national committees found something to agree on&lt;/a&gt;: avoiding TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocqqQ1"&gt;On July 31st, President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/1/21350578/tiktok-ban-president-trump-comments-order"&gt;announced he’d ban the app&lt;/a&gt; from the US. Trump then issued an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;on August 6th&lt;/a&gt; banning “transactions” between people in the US and TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance. He also declared TikTok a “national emergency,” which is honestly the kind of publicity you can’t buy. A &lt;em&gt;national emergency! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QZ55R"&gt;Understandably, TikTok’s CEO, Kevin Mayer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403698/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-trump-administration-ban-microsoft-disney"&gt;quit on August 27th&lt;/a&gt;. He had joined the company in May, having left a lucrative post as Disney’s head of streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GyHxxb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;By December, the controversy had matured into a pile of lawsuits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WAuWCB"&gt;The administration’s fears aren’t really about the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of TikToks — though some of the content, such as Sarah Cooper’s Trump impression, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ohheyjenna/status/1274558069876367361"&gt;the teens&lt;/a&gt; who are credited with organizing on TikTok to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html"&gt;ruin one of his rallies&lt;/a&gt;, may have gotten under the president’s skin. Rather, the &lt;em&gt;stated&lt;/em&gt; concern was about how much data on US users the Chinese government should be allowed to gather. The privacy freak-out occurred shortly after the revelation that the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature"&gt;snooping on users’ clipboard data&lt;/a&gt;, a practice TikTok says it would stop. (For what it’s worth, LinkedIn and several other apps &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/"&gt;were up to the exact same thing&lt;/a&gt;; while TikTok collects a lot of unnecessary data, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-says-it-sent-warning-about-tiktok-app-to-employees-by-mistake/"&gt;so does everyone else&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1E8dlT"&gt;By December, the controversy had matured into a pile of lawsuits — with judges ordering the TikTok ban should be entirely blocked. The entire farce seemed to demonstrate what the US in 2020 would be willing to do to competitive, non-US apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3t3Hw"&gt;It is trivially obvious that the debacle was less about TikTok and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;more about anti-Chinese sentiment&lt;/a&gt;. Once upon a time, Americans might have pointed out that American companies running on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/6/3224100/steve-crocker-how-the-internet-was-created"&gt;commercial version of a military project&lt;/a&gt; were projecting American values: freedom of speech, including the freedom to dissent against one’s government. Of course, in 2013 Edward Snowden smashed that impression — the US was spying on &lt;em&gt;everyone,&lt;/em&gt; collecting bulk data from every US company in secret, with the help of American tech companies. The fear is that China &lt;em&gt;might be doing the exact same thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM24ZL"&gt;Any government collecting this kind of bulk data is a threat to freedom for all people, but that appears to be beside the point. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355465/tiktok-us-china-information-nationalism-online-propaganda"&gt;There is no moral reason&lt;/a&gt; to view China’s collection of bulk data as any different than American collection of bulk data, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/trumps-farcical-inept-and-deadly-serious-coup-attempt/617309/"&gt;President Donald Trump attempted a coup to reject democratic election results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3UxeHR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Trump administration chose to try to strongarm TikTok into being sold to an American company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LTLOyp"&gt;But let’s imagine an American government that is actually interested in its citizens’ privacy. One possible remedy for discovering that TikTok &lt;em&gt;and everyone else&lt;/em&gt; were collecting a scary amount of data is an internet privacy bill that treats every company the same, American or not. Legislation could also decree that companies dispose of the sensitive data they collect on their users after a certain period of time. And if the concerns are around state actors such as China or even the US collecting sensitive data through these companies, well, that seems like the kind of thing one sorts out at the United Nations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHma9z"&gt;The Trump administration, instead, chose to try to strongarm TikTok into being sold to an American company, highlighting the view that the problem was not that TikTok was collecting the data in the first place, but simply that it was collecting the data &lt;em&gt;for the wrong country&lt;/em&gt;. The August 6th executive order, which demanded that an American company purchase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352878/trump-us-ban-tiktok-microsoft-acquisition-treasury-interview-deadline"&gt;TikTok’s US business&lt;/a&gt; within 45 days, was later extended to give &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369753/bytedance-tiktok-trump-china-app-privacy-90-days"&gt;ByteDance 90 days&lt;/a&gt; instead, though — confusingly — the Department of Commerce was still operating with a 45-day deadline, on September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nQWLL"&gt;Once TikTok was on the auction block, Walmart, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/8/21359720/bill-gates-microsoft-tik-tok-deal-comments-interview"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/8/21360259/twitter-and-tiktok-acquisition-trump-microsoft"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373225/oracle-tiktok-us-business-acquisition-ellison-trump"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; were reportedly among the interested parties. Except the Oracle / Walmart deal that emerged addressed &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the purported security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GdK4I5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The deal that emerged addressed &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the purported security concerns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h94Uhv"&gt;The deal — which has not yet closed — created a new company called TikTok Global. There is, however, some confusion about how that company is going to work. According to ByteDance, it will own 80 percent of the company and the Oracle / Walmart consortium will own 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irrq9x"&gt;Oracle, however, views this differently. “Upon creation of TikTok Global, Oracle/Walmart will make their investment and the TikTok Global shares will be distributed to their owners, Americans will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448983/tiktok-oracle-bytedance-chinese-ownership-global-trump-deal"&gt;Oracle said in a statement to reporters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9vsR"&gt;To add to the hilarity, the Oracle deal appears to be… for hosting on Oracle’s cloud servers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436035/tiktok-oracle-deal-bytedance-president-trump-safety"&gt;accomplishes absolutely nothing&lt;/a&gt; in assuaging the security concerns that were the pretext for the deal’s existence in the first place. Oracle isn’t writing the code; even if they’re auditing it, it’s still possible for ByteDance to sneak stuff by. Oracle doesn’t get the algorithm &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;moderation, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDXnSu"&gt;“A deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok,” former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1305290677241085954"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, “and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YAn9yd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If TikTok is saved, you can thank me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1isXom"&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/09/19/walmart-statement-about-potential-investment-in-and-commercial-agreements-with-tiktok-global#:~:text=TikTok%20Global%20will%20be%20an,five%20member%20Board%20of%20Directors.&amp;amp;text=TikTok%20Global%20will%20create%20more,dollars%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Treasury."&gt;Walmart has promised&lt;/a&gt; the new company, TikTok Global, will pay $5 billion &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; in taxes to the US. Bragging about new jobs and tax revenue isn’t necessarily unusual in the corporate world, but this time it feels weird — since Trump publicly said in August that the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/us/politics/trump-tiktok-deal-treasury.html"&gt;US Treasury ought to get a “very big proportion”&lt;/a&gt; of whatever price TikTok was sold at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsLiC1"&gt;Incidentally, in October it came out that Oracle’s bombastic founder, Larry Ellison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/17/21520356/oracle-tiktok-larry-ellison-lindsey-graham-super-pac-donation-jaime-harrison"&gt;donated a cool quarter-million&lt;/a&gt; to a super PAC that supported Lindsey Graham. In an August &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/08/qanon-is-batshit-crazy-lindsey-graham-talks-tiktok-online-conspiracies-and-why-hes-sticking-with-trump"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Graham said &lt;em&gt;he &lt;/em&gt;was the one who told Trump to find a US company to buy TikTok. “Let Microsoft or somebody buy it, put it in American hands and allow the platform to survive and thrive because so many people enjoy it,” Graham claims he told Trump. “If TikTok is saved, you can thank me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lwzepf"&gt;Twice now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;judges have said&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration can’t ban TikTok. But the wheels of justice turn slowly — and so TikTok has sustained plenty of damage while the courts have been catching up to the Trump administration’s pronouncements. In fact, there is another American business that benefits from this digital protectionism, besides Oracle and Walmart: Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfQ9vU"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html"&gt;India banned TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in June, a Facebook data scientist reported that use of Facebook products surged in response. “With TikTok gone, Instagram’s daily users increased 9 percent and were spending 19 percent more time within the app,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"&gt;Casey Newton reported for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “With TikTok gone, they posted 5 million more stories and sent 214 million more messages on Instagram alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vItrPJ"&gt;So, what have we learned from this bizarre episode? The Trump administration has a shaky grasp on what’s legal; despite an order being potentially illegal, it can still do a great deal of damage before any judges catch up; Walmart apparently wants in on a social network; Graham is either the Trump tech whisperer or a shameless braggart; and no one in government really seems to give a shit about user privacy — from China or otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="474OsC"&gt;At least the teens kept dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook criticizes Apple’s iOS privacy changes with full-page newspaper ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZ8nzEUiHDRKZmMRbXSOmwDkXi8=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68521115/facebooknewspaperad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s newspaper ad.&lt;/em&gt; | Dave Stangis (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/DaveStangis/status/1339183289349918721" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtzT51"&gt;Facebook is publicly criticizing Apple’s upcoming iOS privacy changes in full-page newspaper ads today. “We’re standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere,” reads the headline on an ad inside the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; today. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/facebook-attacks-apple-s-ios-changes-in-full-page-newspaper-ads"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the ads are related to Apple’s iOS 14 privacy changes that will make it more difficult for companies like Facebook to target users with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FF9Wb"&gt;Developers will need to ask iOS 14 users for permission to gather data and track them across mobile apps and websites on an iPhone and iPad soon. Apple had planned to implement these changes with the initial iOS 14 release in September, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed enforcing them until early next year&lt;/a&gt;. These changes will impact Facebook’s ad business, and in particular its ad network for developers and businesses, as end users are more likely to opt out of tracking prompts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDIFYM"&gt;Facebook claims Apple’s changes will be “devastating to small businesses” that rely on its ad network to generate sales. The newspaper ads direct small businesses to Facebook’s “&lt;a href="http://fb.com/speakupforsmall"&gt;speak up for small business&lt;/a&gt;” site, where a series of business owners speak out about Apple’s changes. “Small businesses deserve to be heard,” Facebook writes. “We hear your concerns, and we stand with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5hXbSk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m pretty certain &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is fighting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; to retain access to personal data. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PID?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#privacy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fullpagead?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fullpagead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wsj?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#wsj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/029WwaGSs0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/029WwaGSs0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dave Stangis (@DaveStangis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveStangis/status/1339183289349918721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdqX3z"&gt;While Apple hasn’t responded directly to today’s newspaper ads, the company did respond to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/apple-defends-decision-to-delay-privacy-feature-slams-facebook"&gt;similar Facebook claims&lt;/a&gt; last month. The iPhone maker accused Facebook of a “disregard for user privacy.” Apple is adamant that its iOS 14 privacy policies will be enforced in early 2021, and has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=hx9s63c5&amp;amp;1599152522"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; it’s “committed to ensuring users can choose whether or not they allow an app to track them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ud375"&gt;Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new App Store Privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; this week, shining a light on how iOS apps use your data. Notably, the privacy label on Facebook’s iOS app expands across several pages, listing all the data that can be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkmB4S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple exposing all the ways Facebook tracks you with it iOS app is really quite something &lt;a href="https://t.co/hDhB85qk1L"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hDhB85qk1L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dyHAKR"&gt;These full-page newspaper ads are the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;public spat between Facebook and Apple&lt;/a&gt; over privacy, policies, and more. Facebook slammed Apple’s App Store policies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, after it had to remove a mini games feature to pass Apple’s strict App Store approval process. Facebook also welcomed the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) this week. Both acts introduce new rules for digital platform holders, and aim to force companies to rapidly remove illegal content from the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKEjNj"&gt;“We hope the DMA will also set boundaries for Apple,” said a Facebook spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-criticizes-apple-as-it-welcomes-europes-new-tech-rules.html"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers, as well as large platforms like Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new password manager works across Edge, Chrome, and mobile devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV9P_raGFSQNwxGrQ1pnb4-n0eQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68520716/microsoftauthenticator.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3NPvR3"&gt;Microsoft is building a new password manager that syncs credentials across its Edge browser, Google Chrome, and mobile iOS or Android devices. A preview version of the password manager is now built into Microsoft Authenticator, a free mobile app that’s used for multi-factor authentication. Like many other password managers, it can &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/securely-manage-and-autofill-passwords-across-all-your-mobile/ba-p/1751710"&gt;autofill passwords&lt;/a&gt; in apps or websites on iOS or Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgv9rP"&gt;Passwords are synced from the Microsoft Edge browser, and can be shared across multiple devices using a Microsoft Account. You can also sync these passwords to Google Chrome, using a &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-autofill/fiedbfgcleddlbcmgdigjgdfcggjcion"&gt;new Microsoft Autofill extension&lt;/a&gt;. This will sync any passwords stored on your Microsoft Account.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new autofill feature in Microsoft Authenticator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qj2H7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997034/microsoft-365-life-consumer-subscription-features-release-date-rumors"&gt;Rumors had suggested&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft would create a full password manager for its Microsoft 365 consumer service, but this appears to be the next best thing. The autofill feature will be useful for Microsoft Account users working across multiple devices, but a full password manager like 1Password or LastPass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;is still a good option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56V0Dd"&gt;This new autofill feature is available as a preview in Microsoft Authenticator today, and you’ll need to enable it as the default autofill provider in the iOS or Android settings of your device. Autofill only works with consumer Microsoft Accounts and is disabled for enterprise users who are using the app for phone sign in or multi-factor authentication. Businesses need to &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-auth-app-faq#autofill-for-it-admins"&gt;join an allow list&lt;/a&gt; to enable this for enterprise Microsoft Authenticator users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will make custom-fitted $25 T-shirts after photographing your body</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hfWNZE41TfmbLSorTC-a2SHhyA=/0x30:1154x799/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68520709/81finKMJVnL._AC_UL1500_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ulj7To"&gt;Amazon just launched its new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HPZ3RHR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Made for You&lt;/a&gt; custom clothing service in the US that requires users to upload their measurements and two photos to create a “virtual body double.” The first product is a $25 Made for You T-shirt available in a variety of colors, fabrics, necklines, and shirt / sleeve lengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJpMzv"&gt;Amazon Made for You requires two head-to-toe photos taken by the Amazon app, showing the front and back of your torso. Then, after entering your height, weight, and body type, Amazon will create your custom avatar. From there you can build custom T-shirts complete with a personalized name tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcOmG0"&gt;The Made for You product page is littered with zealous quotes from fashion influencers. Sai De Silva is especially enthusiastic about sending Amazon her intensely private data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fC4d0Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“So much fun”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YtqV8J"&gt;“I got to create a virtual body double with my measurements. So much fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5naoqy"&gt;Fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voTxpH"&gt;While the collection of body-type data will undoubtedly help Amazon compete with traditional fashion houses, Amazon says customers can delete it at any time by tapping the profile icon in the upper left of their Made for You page, according to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/amazon-fashion-launches-a-custom-clothing-service-made-for-you/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Amazon also says that photos are deleted immediately after creating the body double. Amazon plans to enhance Made for You with more styles and options based on customer feedback, according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SoPpZ"&gt;The launch of Made for You follows Amazon’s discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274805/amazon-echo-look-discontinue-gadget-shopping-recycle-fashion-camera"&gt;Echo Look&lt;/a&gt; experiment that involved standalone cameras that offered fashion advice, and arrives just as the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;$99.99 Halo tracker&lt;/a&gt; becomes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174145/amazon-halo-fitness-tracker-voice-buy"&gt;more widely available&lt;/a&gt; to track your body fat in 3D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w874vx"&gt;So. Much. Fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NPR shows are now available on Spotify worldwide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-LlnTr06g2p5CI0XMmhfmBswXA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68520657/acastro_180213_1777_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vFp7BG"&gt;Two unlikely podcasting networks — NPR and Spotify — are teaming up. The companies announced a new distribution deal today that’ll bring select NPR programs, like &lt;em&gt;Planet Money&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TED&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Radio Hour&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Invisibilia &lt;/em&gt;to Spotify’s global audience. NPR first brought its shows to Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-05-10/spotify-and-npr-team-up-to-feed-your-podcast-addiction/"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but only for US audiences because of various regulations and country-specific licensing structures. Now it’s able to distribute those shows globally, although the details of the new arrangement remain unclear. The companies won’t be sharing revenue or jointly selling ads from this broader distribution deal, but they both have committed to respective marketing pushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08gPua"&gt;The new agreement speaks to Spotify’s reach around the world and simultaneous role as both a formidable competitor to networks like NPR and an essential ally. Spotify has signed exclusive podcasting deals with big names and effectively moved to push the podcasting industry toward more of a walled-garden approach. This puts some of its competitors in an awkward position, specifically if they were looking to contract some of this talent or if they find Spotify promoting its in-network shows over theirs. In this case, NPR knows Spotify is available on both iOS and Android and is available in many countries around the world, making it a crucial partner for releasing programming everywhere. They’re playing nice for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K68oi3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Note series will reportedly still continue next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FykqLPXh5_1AxlpxmbJlDf3ylOc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68520572/vpavic_200807_4133_0116.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OgedEL"&gt;While Samsung’s mobile boss TM Roh has telegraphed plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;bring stylus support to more phones&lt;/a&gt; across its lineup, there may still be a new Galaxy Note in 2021. An anonymous Samsung official &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20201216007800320"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company is “preparing to release the Galaxy Note series next year” and that “Roh’s message does not mean that the Galaxy Note series will be discontinued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKkgVE"&gt;Samsung declined to comment on the specifics of &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;’s report when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but provided the following statement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5GSu57"&gt;Samsung confirms plans to bring some of the most beloved features of the Galaxy Note to more device categories in 2021. We remain committed to providing the best mobile experience to our consumers and will continue to actively listen and consider consumer feedback in all our product innovations. We cannot share any further details at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5Tk1VA"&gt;The obvious question, if &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;’s report is accurate, is how Samsung will set the Note series apart. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506471/samsung-galaxy-note-20-review-price-stylus"&gt;This year’s model&lt;/a&gt; already felt like you were paying for the S Pen support alone, considering how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; outpaced it on specs and undercut it on price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYhZSU"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; was a more compelling — albeit expensive – proposition, but it’s hard to see how it’d fit alongside a presumable full complement of stylus-compatible Galaxy S21 devices with comparable screen sizes. And the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; shows that foldable phones may soon be a more broadly viable option at the top end of Samsung’s range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GlNSA"&gt;Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/18/21521860/samsung-galaxy-phones-january-2021-renders-leak"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to unveil its widely-leaked next flagship Galaxy S phones in January, a little earlier than usual. We’ll have to wait and see if that lineup leaves any gaps for a potential Note 21 to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will combat COVID-19 misinformation more directly with notifications to users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVfwVA1qNFxoVJDEVFHFKkq90G0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68519578/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8IZWk"&gt;Facebook will send notifications directly to users who like, share, or comment on COVID-19 posts that violate the company’s terms of service, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90586312/facebook-notifications-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDY7Bl"&gt;This new feature works like this: if a user interacts with a post that’s later removed, Facebook sends a notification to the user telling them that the post was taken down. If the user clicks the notification, they’ll be taken to a landing page with a screenshot of the post and a short explanation for why it was removed. The landing page will also feature links to COVID-19 educational resources and actions, like unfollowing the group that posted it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGBScnSAWSudTUD0tbE9A_uRExo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173259/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_3.16.44_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Facebook, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90586312/facebook-notifications-covid-19-misinformation" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s updated anti-misinformation notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Ejxt"&gt;This is an expansion of Facebook’s previous attempts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223456/facebook-coronavirus-misinformation-fake-news-warning-update-who"&gt;combat misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. Before this, the company displayed a banner on the news feed, urging users who had engaged with content that had been removed, to “Help Friends and Family Avoid False Information About Covid-19.” But users were often confused at what the banner was referring to, a Facebook product manager told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company. &lt;/em&gt;The hope is that new approach is more direct than the banner, while still avoiding scolding users or re-exposing them to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook anti-misinformation box for the novel coronavirus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UgUxSaDSOI7iZcTOaYXveEvt9aU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19902115/InLine_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s previous anti-misinformation banner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nnRMPc"&gt;Facebook’s modified approach is arriving almost a year into the pandemic — a little late. The notifications don’t debunk claims in removed posts. They also don’t apply to posts that later have fact-checking labels put on them, &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; writes. That means less-dangerous misinformation still has the opportunity to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PVOUN"&gt;Facebook has been slow to act on misinformation that the company doesn’t consider dangerous. Though conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines have spread for months, Facebook only began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in December&lt;/a&gt;. The question now is: is this too little, and too late?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxjiIw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOhXxz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s UK users will lose EU privacy protections next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6MzW0u4Te0h4oYxefRTg2uyzaCk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68519496/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63rnoy"&gt;Facebook is moving its UK users out from under the strict privacy protections of the European Union, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-facebook-exclusive-idUSKBN28P2HM"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Users of the social media site, and of Instagram and WhatsApp, will have to sign a terms of service agreement in the coming months with Facebook’s headquarters in California, instead of its European branch based in the Republic of Ireland. Moving the user agreements to the US means that UK users will no longer be covered by data policies crafted to adhere to the EU’s stringent privacy regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdteRO"&gt;This change is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145180/google-uk-user-data-processing-ireland-usa-authorities-data-protection-gdpr-cloud-act"&gt;the one Google made&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. It’s meant to avoid a situation where UK citizens are no longer citizens of the European Union, but have agreements based in an EU country, where Facebook is subject to the EU’s data protection laws. Users will still be protected by the UK’s data privacy laws, &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/brexit/2617110/information-rights-and-brexit-faqs-v2_3.pdf"&gt;which currently mirror the EU’s GDPR&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2iNrsR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There will be no change to the privacy controls or the services Facebook offers to people in the UK.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VECGOH"&gt;Some UK privacy advocates are concerned the UK could eventually weaken its privacy laws once it’s outside the EU. The executive director of Open Rights Group said to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that “[t]he bigger the company, the more personal data they hold, the more they are likely to be subject to surveillance duties or requirements to hand over data to the U.S. government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64t5cM"&gt;The worries aren’t founded on nothing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17131004/cloud-act-congress-omnibus-passed-mlat"&gt;Back in 2018, the US passed the CLOUD Act&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easier for the US government to share US companies’ data with foreign law enforcement (which UK agencies would count as).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiQ6qj"&gt;There’s also the matter of bargaining. Because the UK &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47213842"&gt;will no longer be included&lt;/a&gt; in the EU’s trade agreements, the country will have to start making their own — and privacy advocates are worried about what protections the US may ask to be given up in negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f86pNt"&gt;Facebook’s UK branch told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that “there will be no change to the privacy controls or the services Facebook offers to people in the UK,” but users of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram will have to re-agree to the terms and conditions again, which Facebook will ask them to do sometime in the next six months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service is now available on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJ9WHxxGyq2Rhs5Nm7V30-eksBk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68519418/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rYXHRy"&gt;Amazon’s cloud gaming service, Luna, is now available on Android, Amazon announced on Tuesday. Like the iOS version of Luna, there’s no separate Luna app to download — instead, you’ll access the service through the Chrome web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgYRKn"&gt;Amazon launched Luna in early access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525435/amazon-luna-early-access-cloud-gaming"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, where it was initially available on PC, Mac, Fire TV, and on iPhone and iPad via web apps. The service works on a channels-based model, where you pay a monthly fee for each channel of games you want access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A87li1"&gt;Right now, there are two channels available. Amazon’s $5.99-per-month Luna Plus channel has games from many different publishers, and Ubisoft’s $14.99-per-month Ubisoft Plus channel offers Ubisoft games. (Paying that $14.99-per-month fee for the Ubisoft Plus channel also gives you access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535105/ubisoft-plus-uplay-subscription-service-google-stadia-amazon-luna-pc-gaming"&gt;Ubisoft Plus on PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174222/ubisoft-plus-google-stadia-support-live-now-game-subscription-service"&gt;on Google’s cloud gaming service, Stadia&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRVMnf"&gt;Luna only available in the US right now, and if you don’t have early access already, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/luna/landing-page?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can request it here&lt;/a&gt;. If you do have early access and want to start playing Luna on Android, follow the instructions &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonluna/status/1338974518556065792?s=20"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4N1n6x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheCodeB00K?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheCodeB00K&lt;/a&gt;, as Raghu from Team Luna explains below, you won’t have to wait very long for Android support (or, like, at all). Play Luna with early access now: &lt;a href="https://t.co/IU81kXZouU"&gt;https://t.co/IU81kXZouU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aVDCbQcP64"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aVDCbQcP64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Amazon Luna (@amazonluna) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonluna/status/1338974518556065792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AjWzn2"&gt;Right now, Luna’s Android version works on some Pixel, Samsung, and OnePlus devices, but Amazon says Luna will add support for more Android devices during Luna’s early access period. An Amazon spokesperson shared a list of currently-supported devices with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lmKAjb"&gt;Pixel 4XL, 4A, 4A 5G, 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3LNDEl"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10, S10 Plus, Note 10, Note 10 Plus, S20, S20 Plus, S20 Ultra, Note 20, Note 20 Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qjqocy"&gt;OnePlus 7, 7 Pro, 7 Pro 5G, 8, 8 Pro, Nord, 7T, 7T Pro, 7T Pro 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mgXSp0"&gt;You’ll also need to be using Android 9 or higher and Chrome version 86 or newer. You’ll be able to play games using &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?ots=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21289476%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s own Luna controller&lt;/a&gt; as well as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One controller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail was messed up for a ‘significant’ number of users today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q90TphPk8CdZVscZdQE7icK1gVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68518536/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUAAel"&gt;Google says that a “significant subset” of Gmail users ran into errors with the service Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJZcLL"&gt;While users could access their inboxes, they may have encountered “error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;iid=a8b67908fadee664c68c240ff9f529ab"&gt;a message&lt;/a&gt; on its service status page. Google said the issues with Gmail were resolved at 6:51PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmEhxM"&gt;The errors came just a day after many Google properties, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, were hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173803/gmail-youtube-google-assistant-docs-down-outage"&gt;a widespread outage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fmTpt"&gt;Downdetector, which monitors reports of website issues, showed a spike of problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/gmail/"&gt;impacting Gmail&lt;/a&gt; starting around 3PM ET. Users reported being unable to access their inboxes, while others have said they were receiving bounceback messages when trying to email someone with a Gmail address. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1338969496283963392"&gt;ProtonMail said&lt;/a&gt; that emails sent to Gmail users were “permanently bouncing,” returning error messages to the original sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tk4htV"&gt;Stadia, Google’s cloud gaming service, was also having issues this afternoon, but it’s unclear if they were related. The company said a problem was “prohibiting some users from launching games.” Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the issue with Stadia had been resolved at 4:31PM ET and that “users should be able to play games as usual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqNq69"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 7:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says the problems with Gmail have now been fixed. This article has been updated to reflect that the issues are resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
