    <title>NASA’s newly launched Lucy spacecraft is having issues with one of its solar panels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lai31ZuFR6c0DyxiXnoAYhGdLGM=/0x131:3110x2204/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011705/21_00210_lucy_solar_deploy_074.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Lucy’s solar panels fully deployed before its launch&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lockheed Martin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k92NoU"&gt;A robotic spacecraft that NASA just launched to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22711372/nasa-lucy-mission-jupiter-trojan-asteroids-12-years-launch"&gt;explore clusters of asteroids around Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; may be in some slight trouble on its journey through space. The space probe, named Lucy, is &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/lucy/2021/10/17/lucy-spacecraft-healthy-solar-arrays-being-analyzed/"&gt;having issues with one of its two main solar panels&lt;/a&gt;, which are critical for gathering rays from the Sun and generating power for the spacecraft on its 12-year trip through the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WOopU"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729626/nasa-launches-lucy-probe-study-jupiter-trojan-asteroids"&gt;launched Lucy early in the morning on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, October 16th, on top of an Atlas V rocket from Florida. The launch was deemed a success, putting Lucy on its trajectory to reach Jupiter’s asteroids, named the Trojans, by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s7dlq4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AB4wFg"&gt;But on Sunday, NASA announced that one of Lucy’s 24-foot-wide solar panels may not be fully latched, according to an update on the agency’s website. It’s unclear what that means for the future of the mission, but NASA says the mission team is working on analyzing the problem and will come up with next steps in the days ahead. In the meantime, both of the solar arrays are producing power and charging the battery, so the latch issue does not seem to be negatively affecting Lucy at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PF_ttE2IkpWqWKyes5fTq3l-Wy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22929031/final_lucy_high_end_render_pira.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the Lucy spacecraft at a Trojan asteroid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="In1o5M"&gt;“All other subsystems are normal,” NASA says in its statement. “In the current spacecraft attitude, Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5BrAn"&gt;However, an improperly latched solar array might be an issue as Lucy makes its way deeper into the Solar System. The spacecraft is slated to visit seven Trojan asteroids, as well as an asteroid in the main Asteroid Belt, and it will swing by Earth up to three times to get a boost from our planet’s gravity. It’s a long road ahead, and generating power from the Sun will be absolutely vital on its journey.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone unboxed the Pixel 6 early and didn’t bother to turn it on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 color choices" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-XfVzGdHxQQaqtli3WLbugSjLuk=/0x22:3170x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011701/pixel_6_phones.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pixel 6 color choices | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auC0LN"&gt;Google’s upcoming phones have made early appearances in leaks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/14/20865699/pixel-4-xl-leaked-photos-camera-specs"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/3/17814936/google-pixel-3-xl-leak-found-in-lyft"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/3/18527905/pixel-3a-xl-best-buy-leak-6-inch-display-64gb-ram-specs-features"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/3/4691652/did-google-just-leak-the-nexus-5-kitkat-video"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3493954/lg-nexus-4-full-review-leaked-ahead-of-announcement"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; again, so it’s really no surprise that someone seems to have obtained a retail-boxed Pixel 6 unit ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;the fall launch event tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG6u53"&gt;In a video posted initially to TikTok, then deleted but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469"&gt;still available on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, @CristianDimboiu takes a literal approach to unboxing by removing the “Sorta Seafoam” green device from its carrier without going any further. You won’t see the screen turn on or see the screen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dxeipT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 - World First Unboxing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GooglePixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GooglePixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Launch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0z6wttnVp7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0z6wttnVp7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris DB (@CristianDimboiu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CristianDimboiu/status/1450058587091390469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fd2ZyY"&gt;Fortunately, Google apparently ships its new phone upside down so that you can see the camera bar at the back with multiple lenses. It also appears that this phone ships with a cable and USB-C adapter but no charger, so hopefully, new owners will have one handy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Google’s own preview&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Pixel 6 Pro adds a telephoto lens to the mix, but more about the hardware performance, display characteristics, and software tweaks will have to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cmdcuV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Pixel 6: what to expect from Google’s thoroughly pre-announced phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PFB3Oe"&gt;What we know so far about the Pixel 6 family, thanks to retailer leaks over the weekend, is that pricing may have dropped compared to the Pixel 5. If information from Target is correct, then the 128GB Pixel 6 will go on sale for $599, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro costs $898.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Third-party health apps are vulnerable to hacks, report finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QdpROay5jrcO6XdQDyc305zrzC4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011640/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XVXIhW"&gt;Third-party health apps that pull patient data from electronic health record systems are vulnerable to hacks, according to a &lt;a href="https://approov.io/for/playing-with-fhir/"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt;. The electronic health records themselves, which are housed at health centers and subject to the federal privacy law HIPAA, are well protected. But as soon as a patient gives permission for their data to leave the health record and head toward a third-party app — like programs that track people’s medications, for example  — it’s easy for hackers to access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qT48k"&gt;Hospitals and health care systems are a major target for hackers, and attacks have only escalated over the past few years. Patient health data is some of the &lt;a href="https://www.accountablehq.com/post/why-is-phi-valuable-to-hackers"&gt;most valuable&lt;/a&gt; information to hackers: each record can be worth hundreds of dollars on the dark web, in part because they can’t be changed easily and it’s harder to detect when the data is used fraudulently. Credit card numbers, on the other hand, can easily be changed and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are only worth a few dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg25hZ"&gt;For this new report sponsored by app security company Approov, cybersecurity analyst Alissa Knight checked for vulnerabilities in apps built using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which was set up to encourage information exchange in healthcare. She started by checking apps built within the electronic health records themselves and didn’t find weaknesses. But when she tested third-party programs that link up with health records to pull out data, she found major problems. Knight was able to access over 4 million patient and clinician records from over 25,000 providers through those holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlbkwh"&gt;“She didn’t need to use advanced cybersecurity hacking,” John Moehrke, an interoperability expert and member of the FHIR management group, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/18/my-jaw-dropped-basic-security-flaws-in-third-party-apps-leave-millions-of-patient-records-at-risk/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;STAT News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “She just used basic stuff that your freshman year of cybersecurity would have stressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zaGXO"&gt;Third-party applications and data aggregators are important for healthcare — they help doctors and patients by pulling health records into more accessible formats, or they aggregate information from different appointments into one place. The Department of Health and Human Services has rules that encourage health systems to make sure they can talk to each other electronically — it’s important to help give people access to their own health information and to help doctors coordinate care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8jjoW"&gt;But there needs to be more care and security around those applications, Knight wrote in the report. Once data leaves a health record and enters a third-party application, it isn’t covered by HIPAA, so it isn’t subject to HIPAA’s standards around data protection or on how people should be notified if their data is accessed. The Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688497/ftc-health-app-privacy-transparency-data"&gt;recently clarified&lt;/a&gt; that the third-party apps do have to notify users about data breaches, but the commission can’t add on additional privacy or security regulations for those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZCAqb"&gt;“There needs to be some separate oversight mechanism to protect patients and the apps that they use,” the new report recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVnRwm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMaAYK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2021 MacBook Pro event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15YLNFd7PH2RbmgL3kbAafD-J4s=/61x0:2047x1324/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011638/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s event invitation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple says something is getting “unleashed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="95O0lC"&gt;Apple is kicking off the very best week in tech with a rare Monday event, one it’s decided to call “Unleashed.” That could refer to any number of things, but at a high level we are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22725365/apple-october-macbook-event-unleashed-rumors-pro-airpods"&gt;expecting it to be about new, redesigned MacBook Pro laptops with Apple’s own processors&lt;/a&gt;. Will they be called M1X, M2, or something else? What will the GPU performance be like? Will battery life match the excellent quality of the original generation of M1 Macs? All open questions we hope to see answered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqn21b"&gt;There should be two sizes, with 14- and 16-inch screens. There have been long-standing rumors that Apple will bring back an SD card reader slot, MagSafe for charging, and may even switch these Macs over to more advanced, Mini-LED displays. Apple is also said to be doing away with the unloved (except by a few) Touch Bar and will have a regular row of honest-to-goodness function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LemsyG"&gt;There’s also a late-breaking rumor that Apple will put an actually good webcam inside these MacBook Pros. The disappointing webcams were really the only notable downside with the M1 MacBook Air and base-spec MacBook Pro, so that’s overdue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUoNvQ"&gt;The other side of that webcam rumor is talk that the MacBook Pros will have thinner bezels and therefore an actual notch for the webcam. That likely won’t mean it will use face unlock for unlocking the Mac — a feature many Windows computers have had for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAJy6O"&gt;What else? Tough to say! There are a handful of products that we’ve been expecting, ranging from new AirPods to updated Mac Minis — plus of course we need a final release date for macOS Monterey. We’ll be live blogging the whole event, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h8mNjQ"&gt;Apple Unleashed keynote live blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="3JYFI2"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/17647/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Disney’s latest delays include Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Thor, and Indiana Jones 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hStMa9yaMq95489p-QRdM8pjmnM=/375x0:1500x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011531/strange.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Marvel Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yns5CS"&gt;Disney has just announced delays for &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/marvel-studios-theatrical-release-schedule-2022-2023?linkId=136358525"&gt;its 2022 Marvel films&lt;/a&gt;, along with the upcoming fifth Indiana Jones movie, all of which have been pushed back to later in the year or moved to 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rjtWQ"&gt;The Marvel movie shifts are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"&gt;usual chain reaction delay&lt;/a&gt;: to push back one movie means pushing back all of them, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654577/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-theatrical-release-timing-marvel-mcu"&gt;there’s a domino effect&lt;/a&gt; in pushing everything back a bit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gQSnp5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"},{"title":"Shang-Chi could suffer because Marvel can’t push pause on its big story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654577/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-theatrical-release-timing-marvel-mcu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IsrrsN"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; is moving from March 25th, 2022 to May 6th (when &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; was originally intended to be released).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J14P9J"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;, in turn, moves from May 6th to July 8th (when &lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; was originally scheduled).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NBFfRJ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; is moving from July 8th to November 11th (when Captain Marvel sequel &lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt; was planned for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rDCmWw"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt; is moving from November 11th to February 17th, 2023, when &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; was originally scheduled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nKkLWk"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; is moving to July 28th, 2023, taking the spot of an “Untitled Marvel” movie that Disney had yet to announce. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NFMBMe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Delaying one Marvel movie means delaying all of them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oVrp2V"&gt;Other changes include Disney removing another unknown Marvel film set for release on October 6th, 2023 from its schedule entirely and a third Untitled Marvel movie getting bumped up a week from November 10th, 2023 to November 3rd. Given that Disney doesn’t announce Disney Plus release dates this far in advance, it’s hard to tell whether its 2022 tie-in streaming shows will also be delayed to keep pace with the shuffled film schedule, but it’s likely there will be some changes there, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHbl12"&gt;Unchanged for now is the remainder of the 2021 Marvel schedule (which currently includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; on November 5th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638877/spider-man-no-way-home-first-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; on December 17th&lt;/a&gt;, and the Disney Plus series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671358/hawkeye-first-trailer-disney-plus-christmas-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on November 24th). &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt; is also keeping its May 5th, 2023 date, despite the shuffle of the rest of Marvel’s slate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH60jK"&gt;A far more substantial delay is also coming to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375779/phoebe-waller-bridge-indiana-jones-5-harrison-ford"&gt;as-yet-untitled fifth Indiana Jones film&lt;/a&gt;, which is getting pushed back almost a year from July 29th, 2022 to June 30th, 2023, marking the latest delay for the James Mangold-directed sequel, which had originally been planned for a 2021 release. Harrison Ford is set to reprise his role as the titular character, alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Mads Mikkelsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMJMQd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/doctor-strange-2-thor-love-and-thunder-black-panther-wakanda-forever-release-date-changes-1234857549/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the delays don’t stem from a concern over COVID-related box office numbers or delays but rather due to the simple explanation of needing more time to finish production on some of its films, combined with the interconnected Marvel release strategy and the usual need to avoid conflicts with other studio’s blockbusters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft execs reportedly warned Bill Gates years ago to stop emailing a female employee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bill Gates" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cX33i_X31Ug-_krGCsdIKBD7c3A=/9x928:1820x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011377/1183210445.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s614Xu"&gt;Over 10 years before his departure from Microsoft’s board amid an investigation over an affair with an employee, former CEO Bill Gates was warned by two company executives about inappropriate emails between him and another woman, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-executives-told-bill-gates-to-stop-emailing-a-female-staffer-years-ago-11634559950"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dR2wt"&gt;While he was still an employee at Microsoft and serving as chairman of the board, Gates and a female employee exchanged “flirtatious” emails and propositioned the employee, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported. He was married at the time. When confronted by two company executives, Gates reportedly didn’t deny the exchanges and said he would stop the interaction. The executives informed some members of Microsoft’s board, but the board ultimately decided that since there was no physical interaction between the woman and Gates, no further action was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnIBvl"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Microsoft confirmed the accuracy of the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; report but offered no further comment. But company spokesperson Frank Shaw told the Journal that in 2008, the company was made aware of the email exchange, which happened in 2007. The employee did not make a complaint about the incident, Shaw told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. He described the emails as “flirtatious” but “not overtly sexual” and said Gates had discussed meeting the employee outside of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tKTOG"&gt;A spokesperson for Gates provided a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that differs from the company’s account (and is the same as a comment provided to the &lt;em&gt;Journal)&lt;/em&gt;: “These claims are false, recycled rumors from sources who have no direct knowledge, and in some cases have significant conflicts of interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5ilIK"&gt;In 2019, some of Microsoft’s board members &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/16/22439640/bill-gates-microsoft-board-alleged-affair-investigation"&gt;suggested that Gates should step down&lt;/a&gt; as an investigation about an alleged affair with an employee was being conducted. Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the board in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, before the investigation was completed. The employee reportedly wrote in a letter to the board that she had a years-long sexual relationship with Gates. He and Melinda French Gates, who were married for 27 years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607200/bill-gates-melinda-french-gates-divorce-finalized-financial-assets-foundation"&gt;finalized their divorce in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Zoox will test its autonomous vehicles on Seattle’s rainy streets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfbJ-uE245_Saxq7mO0cpnBOl6U=/0x0:5110x3407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70011310/Zoox_testing_its_L3_fleet_in_Seattle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAj4mx"&gt;Zoox, the autonomous vehicle company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304111/amazon-zoox-acquisition-self-driving-car-autonomous-vehicles-startup-robotaxi-bi-directional-vehicle"&gt;owned by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, said it will test its vehicles on the hilly, rain-drenched streets of Seattle. The company also plans on opening an office there in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJvF07"&gt;Seattle will be the third city to host Zoox’s autonomous vehicles, after San Francisco and Las Vegas. The company said it will deploy a small number of vehicles to “get the lay of the land” before deciding how to expand its operations there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukwx82"&gt;“We’re excited to be testing in Seattle. The data we’re gathering will be invaluable for the continued development of our AI stack,” said Jesse Levinson, CTO and co-founder of Zoox, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h98bnK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The data we’re gathering will be invaluable for the continued development of our AI stack”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aHDfu"&gt;Zoox will use Toyota Highlander SUVs retrofitted with sensors and computer hardware to drive autonomously. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;building its own vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like an oversized toaster on wheels, lacks typical controls like a steering wheel and pedals, and is designed to be bidirectional, meaning it can travel in either direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVSMBi"&gt;A spokesperson for the company wouldn’t disclose how many employees will be based in Seattle, but she did say that Zoox has more than 1,300 employees and a goal of creating more than 450 jobs in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRXFZI"&gt;Seattle is not a hot bed of autonomous vehicle testing, but it has seen its fair share of robot cars. Waymo, a sister company to Google and subsidiary of Alphabet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/3/10905774/google-self-driving-cars-test-kirkland-washington"&gt;tested its vehicles in Kirkland, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, a suburban area to the east of Seattle across Lake Washington. Like Zoox, Waymo cited the city’s wet conditions as ideal for testing autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaOOu7"&gt;Autonomous vehicles have experienced difficulty “seeing” in inclement weather such as rain or fog. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201117192605.htm"&gt;The car’s sensors, like cameras and lidar, can be blocked by snow, ice, or torrential downpours&lt;/a&gt;, and their ability to “read” road signs and markings can be impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHhGNv"&gt;“A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor, and it’s the exact same principle for our technology,” said Kai Wang, director of prediction at Zoox. “The challenges of the Seattle area will let us hone our software stack and ultimately improve the behavior of our vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elden Ring has been delayed, but only by a month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nXqai4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, the newest FromSoftware title created in collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; torture artist / author George R. R. Martin, has been delayed. Bandai Namco announced that the game’s January 22nd release date would be moved back a month explaining that “the depth and strategic freedom of the game exceeded initial expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aOtmC7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Important message:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ELDEN RING will release on Feb 25, 2022, as the depth &amp;amp; strategic freedom of the game exceeded initial expectations. Thank you for your trust &amp;amp; patience. We look forward to seeing you experience the game in the Closed Network Test in Nov.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ELDENRING&lt;/a&gt; Team&lt;/p&gt;— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1450100145689927683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="n3Ue7P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin"&gt;is a bit of a departure&lt;/a&gt; from the formula responsible for FromSoftware’s big hits like &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls &lt;/em&gt;series. The game is open-world and features more traditional storytelling courtesy of George R. R. Martin and veteran game director Hidetaka Miyazaki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9JEAj"&gt;Players based in the Americas can register &lt;a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/landing/elden-ring-closed-network-test"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to participate in the Closed Network Test taking place November 12th-14th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota has gone from lobbying against EVs to spending billions on battery development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpjl7CUfTKimyHI69HTZRvW3zdY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70010943/akrales_180328_2351_0623.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aDOL8F"&gt;Toyota, the largest automaker in the world, announced that it will spend $3.4 billion on “automative batteries” in the US through 2030 — a little more than two months after it was revealed that the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594235/toyota-lobbying-dc-ev-congress-biden-donation"&gt;quietly lobbying elected officials in Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt; to slow the transition to electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8XKfo"&gt;As part of the deal, Toyota will build a new $1.29 billion factory in the US to make batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles, which the company says will generate 1,750 new jobs. The automaker is the latest to announce plans to shore up battery manufacturing in the US, which has been a key goal of the Biden administration’s effort to speed up the switch to EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dV21FO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Of course, Toyota wasn’t always so bullish about electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mHd7nu"&gt;Of course, Toyota wasn’t always so bullish about electric vehicles. Last July, it was reported that top Toyota executives met with congressional leaders behind closed doors to advocate against Biden’s plans to spend billions of dollars to incentivize the shift to EVs. The company was also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;pushing back against the administration’s plan&lt;/a&gt; to adopt the so-called California compromise regarding fuel economy standards as its official position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15B3uN"&gt;But since then, a number of Toyota’s competitors have made moves to accelerate the production of battery-electric vehicles in the US, including Ford, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696427/ford-ev-battery-factory-tennessee-kentucky-investment"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to spend $11.4 billion on the construction of several new battery facilities, and Stellantis, which said it would &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/stellantis-lg-energy-to-build-u-s-battery-factory-in-new-joint-venture/"&gt;build its own battery factory&lt;/a&gt; to help it get to 40 percent of its US sales from electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3BT27"&gt;Despite its efforts to undermine pro-EV policies, the company is positioning itself as a committed participant in the electrification of the auto industry. Toyota said it will form a new company to run its new battery plant with Toyota Tsusho, a subsidiary that now makes an array of parts for the automaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDCD8K"&gt;“Toyota’s commitment to electrification is about achieving long-term sustainability for the environment, American jobs and consumers,” said Ted Ogawa, CEO of Toyota Motor North America, in a statement. “This investment will help usher in more affordable electrified vehicles for US consumers, significantly reduce carbon emissions, and importantly, create even more American jobs tied to the future of mobility.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVMC5M"&gt;For years, Toyota did enjoy a reputation as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. More recently, the automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRaypA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6: what to expect from Google’s thoroughly pre-announced phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ANmSTGFUPwgXmctEALNH7XbPHU=/1142x0:7892x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70010304/Google_Pixel_6_Pro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOXIzj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;We’ve seen the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s decision to announce and thoroughly tease its new high-end flagship was revealing and confusing but, given all the leaks that followed, ultimately not that consequential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL0jRM"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro feature an all-new, in some cases, quite colorful design, with an in-display fingerprint sensor, Google’s new Tensor SoC, and the Titan M2 security chip. The standard Pixel 6 has a 90Hz 6.4-inch screen, while the Pro gets a 120Hz 6.7-inch, but the big difference might end up being the cameras. Both devices have new wide and ultrawide cameras, but the Pro comes with an additional 4x optical zoom periscope lens. You can see what they look like in the hands of real people in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129719782326274"&gt;this Twitter thread of leaked images&lt;/a&gt; from Evan Blass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5INvVo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/xcfQ6ylGuD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xcfQ6ylGuD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129719782326274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOH9Ng"&gt;But now that company is planning on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;launching its new phones on October 19th&lt;/a&gt;, you might be wondering: what could Google have left to share? If leaks are any indication, quite a few interesting things. We’ll be covering Google’s event live on Tuesday, but keep reading below for what to expect ahead of the Pixel 6 launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ckQnWc66L7bV9d2osK3PMYdxPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755089/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2tBUMk"&gt;Powerful new hardware, including upgraded cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rAJIdy"&gt;Google long held the crown for best smartphone camera on its Pixel line but slipped in the last few years in favor of what both Samsung and Apple brought to the table. A clear break from mid-range phones and mid-range specs to something decidedly on the high-end could be just the thing Google needs to retake its crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GffJx5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;Rumors and leaked store pages from Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; (viewable on the Wayback Machine &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124417/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124928/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-pro-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) suggest Google is sparing no expense in updating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;the cameras of the Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;. Both versions of the Pixel 6 feature a 50MP main sensor — a big step up from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12MP camera&lt;/a&gt; — and a 12MP ultrawide. The Pixel 6 Pro also has an extra camera with 4x zoom with 48MP telephoto that can reach an even higher 20x zoom thanks to Google’s Super Res Zoom feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;it first added with the Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydITbR"&gt;On the front of the Pixel 6 Pro, the selfie camera can also be expected to feature a wide 94-degree field of view, not dissimilar from the wide-angle selfie camera on the Pixel 3. People love selfies, and the front camera is another clear place Google could shine since Apple decided to keep selfies the same on the iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5A6jmW"&gt;Surprisingly affordable pricing&lt;/h2&gt;

Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; and Evan Lei. They put the US starting price of 128GB Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones at $599 and $898, respectively. That’s cheaper than where the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; started last year ($699) and could help shake up the market for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Pixel Stand, 30W charging brick, and clear Pixel 6 Case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gvVvjU"&gt;Other tweaks are less visible. The battery in the Pixel 6 is expected to be improved and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158452/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-features"&gt;with Extreme Battery Saver&lt;/a&gt; turned on, lasts for 48 hours on a single charge. The Pixel 6 Pro could also feature even faster charging, with the ability to hit 50 percent charge in 30 minutes, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/massive-leak-just-confirmed-ton-new-pixel-6-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Helping make all of that happen is a new 30W charging brick (which won’t be included in the box) and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt; a new 23W Pixel Stand with active cooling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUOPIU"&gt;The same leaked Pixel 6 store pages also point to the use of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus&lt;/a&gt; for the glass on the new phones and a new clear case that could be perfect for showing off the multicolored varieties of Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tdnanj"&gt;Long-awaited software tricks like the Magic Eraser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjhqyq"&gt;Google can pack as much high-tech hardware into its phones as it wants, but the real trick is all the extra performance its software squeezes out of it. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro appear to have several software features that might do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cnm2I"&gt;First is Magic Eraser, which promises to “remove strangers and unwanted objects” with just a few taps in Google Photos. This actually appears to be a photo feature Google’s been working on for at least four years. The company introduced a similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654476/google-photos-object-removal-feature-demo"&gt;obstruction-erasing feature in 2017&lt;/a&gt; by removing a fence from a photo of a baseball game. The fine print on the leaked store page is clear that Magic Eraser won’t work for every photo, but it certainly seems like it could be very impressive when it does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kB-ygslMZlThvd8jZgUONPvXhC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925206/Screenshot_2021_10_13_4.16.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124417/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html" target="_blank"&gt;Carphone Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446843190892453889?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;@evleaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motion Mode on the new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="epasHb"&gt;Google’s two other software features mentioned in the same leaked store pages are opposites. Face Unblur attempts to deblur faces captured in motion-heavy photos (Google’s example is children playing). While Motion Mode “adds more action to action shots.” It’s not super clear what that entails, but Google’s photo example shows a blurry, clearly in-motion Ferris wheel with two subjects in focus standing in front of it — almost like long exposure background with a traditional photo foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQbbmU"&gt;Other software advancements include several varieties of on-device translation, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Google’s mysteriously structured Tensor chip&lt;/a&gt;. The text from the Carphone Warehouse leak specifically calls out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ap6A2s"&gt;Get your chats translated in real time, listen to podcasts with translated captions and even use your camera to read signs in up to 55 languages. No Internet needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5vIJHc"&gt;Rumors point to fairly extensive software support for both versions of the Pixel 6, which means they could stay ahead of the pack as Google rolls out new features over time. So far, that looks like four major Android updates, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/13/pixel-6-android-updates/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and five years of security updates based on what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; saw in those leaked store pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sVn4l7"&gt;The Google-y versions of an Apple One subscription&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wMCKbJ"&gt;What better to go with a bunch of new phone hardware and software than a nice all-in-one subscription package? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21433205/apple-one-subscription-bundle-price-music-tv-plus-arcade-icloud"&gt;Apple One was Apple’s version of the subscription bundle&lt;/a&gt; tying in services like Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, and extra iCloud storage. Now, it seems like Google might have something similar in mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720374/google-pixel-pass-subscription-premium-services-bundle-extended-warranty"&gt;with a bundle called “Pixel Pass.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g49gvU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pixel Pass: This appears to be a blend of the iPhone upgrade plan where you can get a new phone every year and the Apple One Subscription.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains YouTube Premium, Google One, Play Pass, extended warranty, and is associated with Google Fi.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#pixel6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iU7VTc16vS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iU7VTc16vS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlkSZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500?s=20"&gt;A leaked document from Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; suggests Pixel Pass could combine up to four subscriptions: YouTube Premium or YouTube Music, Google One for extra storage and discounts, Play Pass for apps and games, and Google Fi. The bundle could also incorporate some kind of upgrade plan akin to Apple’s iPhone Upgrade program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6Mp7tu"&gt;A foldable Pixel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jwYDcp"&gt;Last but not least, there’s a whole other Pixel device that Google could show off or at least tease at the launch of the Pixel 6 — a foldable codenamed “Passport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90DkF5"&gt;In 2019, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;revealed it has prototyped foldable devices&lt;/a&gt; for years. The company has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18071720/google-android-foldables-fragmentation-displays"&gt;made modifications to Android&lt;/a&gt; over the years to better support devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697950/android-12-1-foldable-features-report-split-screen-multi-tasking-taskbar"&gt;and it has even more planned&lt;/a&gt;. It follows that Google might at least try its hand at making some kind of device to straddle the phone and tablet markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR16F5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;An internal Google document leaked in 2020&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the company was targeting a 2021 release for the “Passport.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Further reporting from &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this June claimed that Samsung had begun production on folding OLED displays for use in new devices from Google, Vivo, and Xiaomi. That could line up with a late 2021 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbHhyI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 18th, 11:36AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added tweet thread from Evan Blass with pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
