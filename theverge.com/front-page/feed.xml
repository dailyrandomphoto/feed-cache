    <title>5 widescreen videos to watch instead of the 4:3 Snyder Cut of Justice League</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TbJ2CM"&gt;Zack Snyder’s cut of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; is finally available to stream on HBO Max, and while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;rabid fans who helped make it happen&lt;/a&gt; may have been prepared for its 4:3 format, many people were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;a little stunned when they pressed play today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GnF0V"&gt;Listen, I was a fan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7457291/the-wire-hd-screenshot-comparisons"&gt;of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I get it. Artistic vision and all that. But a 4:3 aspect ratio simply clashes with most modern devices. So I’ve rounded up five videos that take full advantage of most widescreen-optimized phones, tablets, and TVs. Use them as a palate cleanser when you finish the Snyder Cut or as a visual release valve when you inevitably pause the four-hour-long version of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;. The world is your banana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="vB6F2j"&gt;1. This video of the Banana orbiting the Earth at the same distance as the International Space Station&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="KKsB3c"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzSqQA"&gt;This video is a few years old, but like all good internet detritus, it was picked up by the undertow of the World Wide Web and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/page_eco/status/1372175858174062594"&gt;resurfaced this week&lt;/a&gt;. It visualizes a simple premise: what if the Banana was the same distance as the ISS? As Obi-Wan Kenobi famously said, “That’s no moon.” Sure isn’t, Obi-wan. And we know that because we can see the Banana in beautiful high-definition widescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="zMj86k"&gt;2. This documentary about the frailty of the environment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="9w4TFP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMmm80"&gt;The Anthropocene has done terrible things to the environment, certainly, but we’d &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be in for it if a Banana the size of North America was orbiting a mere 250 miles above the Earth. This doc expertly uses the widescreen format to help viewers imagine the abject terror they might experience as they look up in awe at the Banana while tsunami sirens blare in the distance. It also really shines on OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="Rfv853"&gt;3. This art-house film about a child losing his banana&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="YEzCSl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F14PFX"&gt;They say loss is nothing but change, and that change is nature’s delight. I say don’t diminish someone’s personal grief, regardless of age. Be sure to watch this one on a backlit screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="2GN7mX"&gt;4. This 90-second spot from the Ad Council about how bananas are, botanically, a &lt;a href="https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/bananas-are-berries.htm"&gt;berry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="83hH05"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BdHVCo"&gt;Wait, I’m sorry, what? A berry? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2fTeQ"&gt;I mean...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVsn5q"&gt;Look, I’m not going to argue with a Banana this big. Just, like... wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ySwXm9"&gt;5. And for those who still need their DC Universe fix, this gritty reboot of &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;, in which the Banana orbits the Earth at a great enough speed to turn back time, thereby erasing humanity from existence.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div id="c6LpKK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paMantiqs54?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kc4YiT"&gt;The wind noise really does it for me if I’m being honest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden to tap former Senator Bill Nelson as NASA chief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bill Nelson" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhPFCBVLEV2MGImCe3ghkwp_GMo=/0x0:4607x3071/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987479/507326628.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yvRV9i"&gt;President Biden has tapped former Democratic Senator Bill Nelson for NASA administrator, according to three people familiar with the decision. Nelson, a politically experienced ally of the administration, would steer the space agency as it races to return humans to the Moon, bolsters its climate research and expands its reliance on a flourishing commercial space industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBJ57w"&gt;A former congressman and three-term US senator from Florida, Nelson would succeed former president Trump’s NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, whose past experience in Congress proved key in rallying support for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; program, an ambitious campaign to use the Moon as a stepping stone for future astronaut missions to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFkNiE"&gt;Biden’s decision comes nearly two months after he took office and as the White House remains largely silent on rolling out any space policy agenda. Senate and NASA staffers who were informally briefed this week on Biden’s decision were told that a formal announcement on Nelson’s nomination would come this week, three sources said, speaking under anonymity to discuss private conversations before the announcement is made. Former astronaut Pam Melroy is being considered for Nelson’s deputy, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1HmDr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BreakingDefense/status/1363950066810171396?s=20"&gt;Rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Biden was considering Nelson to lead NASA had been swirling openly among space industry circles for roughly a month, but it wasn’t until this week that the White House and NASA cemented the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCxp46"&gt;Nelson represented Florida’s Space Coast as a state legislator in the 1970s and championed NASA through his time in Congress. He became the second sitting member of Congress to fly to space in 1986 as a payload specialist aboard Space Shuttle Columbia. A moderate Democrat, Nelson served three terms in the Senate until losing his bid for reelection in 2018 to former Florida Governor Rick Scott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs4R7P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is expanding support for 2FA security keys on mobile devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTCYvGCpcZFMhdxYb8GtsYJdXiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987477/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5qN19r"&gt;Facebook is expanding its support of physical security keys for two-factor authentication (2FA) on mobile devices, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/expanding-support-for-security-keys-on-mobile-devices/"&gt;blog post Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The social platform has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/26/14397276/facebook-two-factor-nfc-security-key-account-hack"&gt;supported security keys for its desktop&lt;/a&gt; version since 2017, but starting today, it will let users on its iOS and Android apps use them to secure their accounts as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYP6xg"&gt;Two-factor authentication provides another layer of support for online accounts, requiring users to log in with their password and an additional piece of information, usually a numeric code generated by a third-party system. Without both pieces of information, it’s much harder for someone to access your account even if they have your password. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgvjCt"&gt;“We strongly recommend that everyone considers using physical security keys to increase the security of their accounts, no matter what device they use,” Facebook’s blog post states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NipKO082BAWQCmbcwMSpTe7eWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379961/2fa_facebook_security_key.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SMrJLf"&gt;Physical security keys, which connect to your device using USB or Bluetooth are widely considered the best way to protect online accounts. Other methods, like authenticator apps or SMS alerts, generate codes for users to type in, but the codes could potentially be intercepted by a malicious third party seeking access. Once a user connects the key — which they need to keep on their person or nearby — to their device, it verifies their identity, allowing them to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80OHkR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332234/twitter-security-key-2fa-authenticator-privacy"&gt;Twitter said earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; it is planning a future update that will allow accounts with 2FA enabled to use security keys as their sole authentication method. Right now, Twitter users can use a security key plus a second 2FA method as backup. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s co-founder is teaming up with Specialized to solve the problem of e-bike batteries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_F8xjgBEXs_OzAshyw6tNE4nwuw=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987364/Specialized_VadoSL.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Specialized&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ydsas2"&gt;The growing popularity of electric bikes has raised a lot of exciting possibilities about the future of transportation, but it also presents a number of unique challenges. Chief among them is what to do with all those e-bike batteries when they eventually run out of juice. Rather than send them to a landfill, one major bike manufacturer is teaming up with a co-founder of Tesla to ensure those batteries have a second life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWVvZ"&gt;Specialized, the third largest bike maker in the US based on market share, is partnering with a firm called Redwood Materials, which is run by Jeffrey “JB” Straubel, a co-founder and former chief technology officer of Tesla, to figure out a process for recycling the company’s e-bike batteries. Those batteries, which are typically attached to or integrated within the downtube of the bike, activate the motor when the cyclist is pedaling or uses a throttle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgIMzF"&gt;The bikes are built to last a lifetime, but the batteries typically run out of power after four and six years, said Chris Yu, chief product officer at Specialized. “Generally, the bikes will long outlast the packs for the typical user,” Yu told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And so it’s always been in the back of our minds: what do we do about them?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XF8svm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The bikes will long outlast the packs for the typical user”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ONSYl"&gt;Enter Redwood Materials. The Carson City, Nevada-based company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15516632/tesla-startup-redwood-materials-recycling"&gt;founded by Straubel in 2017&lt;/a&gt; primarily as a recycler of electric car batteries. In addition to breaking down scrap from Tesla’s battery-making process with Panasonic, Redwood also recycles batteries from Nissan, Amazon, and others. Many of the batteries from those first-wave electric vehicles, like the Nissan Leaf, are just now reaching their end of life and are in need of recycling. Redwood promises that all of its recycling is done domestically — much of the e-waste in the US is shipped to developing countries for smelting — and with an eye toward reuse and recovery. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-race-to-crack-battery-recycling-before-its-too-late/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;referred&lt;/a&gt; to the company as the “anti-gigafactory.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qo_t4Hm1xGqioGxt-duzYlOQFpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379764/Specialized_Creo_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A battery being removed from a Specialized electric bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ALcIRd"&gt;This is how the partnership will work: Specialized will recover depleted e-bike batteries through its network of retail partners and then ship those batteries to Redwood’s facility in Northern Nevada. The first step will be to figure out how much of the battery is reusable, such as various connectors, wires, plastics, and other components. After that, Redwood will begin a chemical recycling process, in which it strips out and refines the relevant elements like nickel, cobalt, and copper. A certain percentage of that refined material can then be reintegrated into the battery-making process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AxXanY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We strive to really minimize any separate waste streams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oMwR9u"&gt;“Usually, there’s not very much else in there that’s very recyclable,” Straubel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But we strive to really minimize any separate waste streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2Iaaa"&gt;Specialized says that by the end of 2021, every one of its e-bike batteries will “have a pathway” to Redwood’s recycling facility. Yu explained that means making customers aware through their local Specialized retailer or via diagnostic notifications through the company’s smartphone app about the expected end-of-life date of their e-bike’s battery and what recycling opportunities are available to them. The company has been piloting this process, and so far, 100 percent of the battery packs it collects are going to Redwood. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xekAg5"&gt;With e-bike sales booming, there is expected to be a tsunami of dead batteries needing to be recycled in the decades to come — perhaps more so than from electric cars. More &lt;a href="https://www.oicompass.com/market-statistics/ziv-publishes-data-on-german-bicycle-market-2020/87815.article"&gt;electric bikes were sold&lt;/a&gt; in Germany in 2020 than all of the electric cars sold in Europe. Over 547,000 e-bikes were sold in the Netherlands last year, or 54 percent more than the total number of cars, both gas and electric. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21016306/electric-bike-ebike-sales-us-numbers-deloitte-cars"&gt;According to Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;, 130 million e-bikes are expected to be sold globally between 2020 and 2023, making them the most popular battery-powered vehicle on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjiL5v"&gt;These data points — a faster product life and higher volume of sales — helped convince Straubel to team up with Specialized on this project. He also was friends with Specialized’s founder and CEO, Mike Sinyard, and helped set him up with a Tesla many years ago. But e-bikes, in addition to other lightweight electric vehicles like scooters and mopeds, are a sign of where things are headed for transportation. Straubel said he was surprised by how much of the e-waste that is processed for recycling is comprised of materials from e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq3gSZ"&gt;“It’s kind of a bellwether, I think, for passenger EVs,” he said&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; “and that’s been a really fascinating thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fzFKc-WRWQfp9pDLa6bc4kg1RbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379969/RedwoodMaterials_6877.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A bin of e-waste at Redwood Materials’ recycling facility. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T0yCCG"&gt;E-waste recycling is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20992240/e-waste-recycling-electronic-basel-convention-crime-total-reclaim-fraud"&gt;notoriously shady business&lt;/a&gt;, with companies sending raw materials overseas to developing nations that lack the infrastructure for safe processing. This has caused &lt;a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/08/27/growing-e-waste-problem/"&gt;a growing ecological disaster&lt;/a&gt;. Straubel insists Redwood is different because it does all of its recycling domestically, not just the separation and aggregation processes. And he aims for maximum transparency, inviting all of his clients to come to the facility and inspect every inch of the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ZLfd"&gt;The gears are shifting in Washington in a way that could have a broad effect on what Specialized and Redwood are hoping to accomplish. A bill was just introduced in the House of Representatives that would &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/03/19/new-us-bill-grants-recycle-batteries/"&gt;incentivize the recycling of lithium-ion batteries&lt;/a&gt;, which are widely used by both electric cars and e-bikes. Another bill would offer a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;tax credit for anyone who purchases an e-bike&lt;/a&gt;. Public tax dollars are flowing into the industry in a way that could underscore the importance of Specialized and Redwood’s partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7IvEa"&gt;“We’ve been working on this for a while. So it was a way to really get in front of it,” Specialized CEO Mike Sinyard told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “People who buy an electric car, but even more, people who buy an electric bike really care about that. And we care deeply about that too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt2I5Q"&gt;Straubel agrees, saying it’s a question that’s on the minds of the people who buy these products: what will happen to it when it eventually runs out of power? “They want to make sure that the solution isn’t worse than the problem,” he said. “But to me, this is a story of optimism because these batteries are very highly recyclable, with the right process and method for doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV is adding local news in many more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QA5U5p09Vv1QUaG0OiJvn8cnzUk=/0x15:831x569/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68987359/FireTV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RC2Xu"&gt;Back in December, Amazon launched an ad-sponsored news app on its Fire TV platform.  At that time, the app offered local news coverage in 12 cities, including New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, and more. But today, Amazon says it’s expanding local news to “88 major cities” across the US, “including popular local stations from news distributors such as ABC Owned Television Stations, CBSN, TEGNA, Cox, The E.W. Scripps Company, and Altice USA.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGh3FV"&gt;The news app now comes built into the Fire TV software, and local news gets its own tab in the app. “Amazon’s thoughtful expansion of local news content on its Fire TV devices is a strong testament to the power of local news to keep communities safe and informed through everything 2020 has brought us, and everything ahead in 2021,” Brian Lawlor, Scripps’ president of local media, said in today’s press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjJ5oM"&gt;Local news is certainly crucial, but the news app also serves as an easy way to bring in extra advertising dollars. Amazon lets you customize the app to some extent to show your preferred news sources: “When you open the app for the first time, you can select the news that matters most to you from national and local sources. A custom playlist will be generated based on your selections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAKDZ4"&gt;At its launch in December, the Fire TV news app already had ABC News Live, CBS News, Reuters, Cheddar, Entertainment Weekly, Black News Channel, and others on board for national news — but expanding local coverage to so many new locations should make the app feel a little fuller and more useful. You can also quickly access local news with an “Alexa, play local news” voice command on the Fire TV remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYw0wX"&gt;Roku has also &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/free-news-channels-roku"&gt;made live news part of&lt;/a&gt; The Roku Channel, so both leading streaming hardware companies seem to think it’s an important add. The full list of cities where Amazon Fire TV now offers local news includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ogt1Og"&gt;Atlanta, GA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0N16La"&gt;Austin, TX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2zQ71y"&gt;Beaumont, TX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElO03b"&gt;Billings, MT&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 8 smart display is over 40 percent off at several retailers</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CRfvv"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VegeDailyDeals03182021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $75 right now. While this is not its lowest price ever (the previous best price was only $5 less), it is still an incredible deal on the normally $130 smart display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;The Echo Show 8 includes a slightly larger display than the Echo Show 5 and also includes support for videoconferencing apps, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G2zdlZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDC3T7"&gt;If you’re looking for a good virtual reality headset but are intimidated by the $300 price tag for the relatively affordable Oculus Quest 2, you’re in luck. Over on Oculus’ official website, the company is selling &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a refurbished first-generation Quest for $199&lt;/a&gt;. This “As Good as New” VR headset includes a full one-year warranty. Like its successor, the Quest is a standalone head-mounted display, which allows you to play VR games without additional hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k6szNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10375901"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXkwyA"&gt;Amazon and the Nintendo eShop have some deals on the &lt;em&gt;XCOM 2 Collection &lt;/em&gt;for the Nintendo Switch. You can grab a digital version for &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/xcom-2-collection-switch/"&gt;$15 at the eShop&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for a physical cartridge, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/XCOM-Collection-Switch-Digital-Code/dp/B086BVMVYW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has that version on sale for $20&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You will watch the Snyder Cut in 4:3 aspect ratio because HBO Max respects cinema</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnbEPeTGQFT9_zzccR8pcA6E0_s=/228x0:2943x1810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986833/snyderwarning.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MYsyZ"&gt;Lest anyone worry that &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SnyderCut031821"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; would tarnish Zack Snyder’s auteur work &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, for which the company &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/the-true-story-of-justice-league-snyder-cut"&gt;spent $70 million&lt;/a&gt; on reshoots and new digital effects in order to meet the director’s requirements and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22334362/zack-snyder-justice-league-fandom-release-cut-star-wars-twitter"&gt;satisfy years of fan demand&lt;/a&gt; for a better cut of the widely panned movie, the service is prefacing all streams of the film with a short disclosure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="815KjL"&gt;“This film is presented in a 4:3 format to preserve the integrity of Zack Snyder’s creative vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9DaXXJ"&gt;That’s right. HBO will not artificially crop the image just to satisfy your natural demand for widescreen viewing. Nor would it tell Snyder that, hey, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/zack-snyder-explains-justice-leagues-first-cow-connection.html"&gt;maybe &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;First Cow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and doesn’t need to be presented in a tight boxy format in which it’s unclear if the entire film was even originally intended to be presented. After three years of demands, this is &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;vision, and no one’s going to touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9764pm"&gt;Now look, I’m not going to make fun of directors choosing less common aspect ratios (I contend that &lt;em&gt;First Cow&lt;/em&gt;, a quiet movie about a cow, which was also shot in 4:3,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was robbed of its place on the Best Picture nominees list). But this does mean that HBO Max’s highest-profile film — one that was announced before the streaming service was even available, is exclusive to the service, and is very much meant to bring in new subscribers — is presented in the aspect ratio of a ’90s TV series and leaves about half the screen empty on most modern devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b389vv"&gt;It was known before the movie’s debut this morning that the Snyder cut would be presented in 4:3. So it’s really only HBO’s warning — likely meant as a heads-up to less obsessive fans who may be confused by the crop — that’s a surprise here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxlMuu"&gt;The film was &lt;a href="https://decider.com/2021/03/18/snyder-cut-justice-league-black-boxes-aspect-ratio/"&gt;supposedly shot for&lt;/a&gt; this boxy format, and if that’s the case, then you’re actually seeing &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;on the screen than you did in the 2017 version (which was released in a more traditional widescreen format... and was also two hours shorter). The intention was for the taller footage to be shown on giant IMAX screens, which are close to a 4:3 ratio, though typically only portions of a movie are presented in the larger format. For now, your best bet at watching the film on a device intended for that screen size is to go with something a bit smaller:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="irs (ray tsang flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP0xxiL-v-HhVA274y3XwS_qa2o=/0x3:1100x736/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687934/irs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSUmXj"&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took everyone, including the IRS, by surprise. Because of the issues people were dealing with last spring, the filing deadline for federal tax payments was moved from the usual mid-April date to July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH5z8m"&gt;This year, it looked look like we weren’t going to get the same tax vacation — until &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline"&gt;the IRS announced on March 17th&lt;/a&gt; that tax day has been pushed back a month. As a result, the new due date for your 2020 taxes is May 17th, 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1IHJ6"&gt;Meanwhile, the IRS has also made it known that the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-operations-during-covid-19-mission-critical-functions-continue"&gt;pandemic is slowing down some operations&lt;/a&gt;, such as processing returns filed on paper. As a result, it might not be a bad idea to start working on those taxes as soon as possible — and to submit them online. In fact, whether you’re a full-time worker dealing with a single 1040 or a freelancer / gig worker getting a series of 1099s, the fastest way to pay the piper these days is to do it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="7RmRXX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10286635"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DtewJZ"&gt;The IRS offers a series of directions &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; to help US citizens figure out their taxes, report those taxes, and send in payments (or ask for refunds) using its e-file online method. Here’s a rundown of what’s available and where you can find it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your first stop: IRS.gov" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZP6jZ2r6bfb_vXfNAlliRrrC5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238649/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.52.29_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your first stop: IRS.gov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MrTZxI"&gt;How do I file online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfouu8"&gt;There are several ways to file online, depending on your income and your comfort level in dealing with the whole income tax process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAGjYo"&gt;If your &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income"&gt;adjusted gross income&lt;/a&gt; was $72,000 or under, you can use the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free"&gt;IRS Free File option&lt;/a&gt;. The site offers a number of third-party services that can help you put together and file your taxes free of charge. Of course, that is assuming the third party doesn’t try to scam you into paying more than you have to; back in April of 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; revealed&lt;/a&gt; that TurboTax and other suppliers were deliberately hiding the pages for their free services in order to convince taxpayers to purchase additional features. As a result, in early 2020, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/1/21045779/irs-turbotax-free-file-h-r-block-tax-preparation-new-rules"&gt;IRS published rules&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting these practices. Still, it pays to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Free File is available for those whose income is $72,000 or under" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xv0usaE6z1RIzq_Gln4pzREg58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238669/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.58.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free File is available for those whose income is $72,000 or under.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fC7FEJ"&gt;If your income is above $72,000, you can still use fillable forms provided by IRS Free File, but you don’t get the support of the free software, and you can’t do your state taxes through this method. The forms will be available starting on January 25th. (If you’re really into doing your own taxes, you may want to check out the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-tax-tips"&gt;IRS page on tax tips&lt;/a&gt;, which includes how to handle things like a &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit"&gt;recovery rebate credit&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlnklN"&gt;If you’re not a pro at filling out taxes, you’re going to either have to use e-file with one of the available software solutions or find a tax preparer who can do it for you. In the case of the latter, the person or company who does your taxes needs to be authorized to use e-file; if you don’t already have a tax professional, you can find one at &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/authorized-irs-e-file-provider-locator-service-for-tax-professionals"&gt;the IRS site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5JFGLd"&gt;How do I pay online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qQd1r5"&gt;The IRS lists a variety of ways you can &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments"&gt;pay your taxes online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmMzlE"&gt;If you use tax preparation software or have your taxes prepared by a tax professional, you can have the IRS pull the funds directly from your bank account via Electronic Funds Withdrawal at the same time you file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwT6HE"&gt;You can also use IRS Direct Pay to pull funds from a savings or checking account. Finally, you can use a credit or debit card; however, there is usually a fee involved (since the IRS isn’t going to absorb what your credit card company is charging for the service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ugxyPN"&gt;How do I get my refund?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8jn9l"&gt;One of the ways the IRS tries to convince you to file online is to assure you that you will get your refund faster — &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds/tax-season-refund-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;in less than 21 days&lt;/a&gt;, in most cases. Once you’ve filed, you can &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds"&gt;check the status&lt;/a&gt; of your refund online. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs2goapp"&gt;download the official IRS2GoApp&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to check the status of your refund, pay your taxes, and get other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfTl5K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021, 9:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on January 19th, 2021 and has been updated to add information about the new tax deadline and the COVID relief bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fear and self-loathing in Animal Crossing: New Horizons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWpWIYA6UAqBUQHZezM5lwFagmY=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986658/2021031616035800_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe that such a pure, wholesome game could become an object of dread&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1p0vkj"&gt;“Where have you been all this time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqooXP"&gt;A wave of guilt washed over me as I read these words on the screen. Considering how 2020 dismantled our reality and created a new set of post-coronavirus social paradigms, the last thing I wanted was to explain myself to someone I thought would understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AIU7g"&gt;My accuser wasn’t a real friend, exactly. It was dear, sweet Merengue, one of my favorite villagers on Beef House, my &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; island. “I dropped by your place to look for you, but you were never home,” she said, eyes downcast. If this had happened in real life, with a real friend, I would have started digging a hole of shame. Next, I bumped into Moe, another island favorite. “Man! Where have you been? You can’t just disappear without saying anything,” he said, bursting into tears. “I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN13P1"&gt;After four months of neglecting my pumpkin patches and flowerbeds, after missing seasonal events, birthdays, bugs, fish, turnips, shooting stars, and crafting specials — I’d finally ripped off the Band-Aid and returned to &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;. And just as I’d expected, it felt really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_ifL-5UI52k5qnkKhUW7EK2WVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379687/2021031615581200_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bD4iPg"&gt;On March 17th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;Nintendo’s much-anticipated life sim was released&lt;/a&gt; — a welcome daily escape during a time of stress and isolation. But reflecting on the game a year on, despite its wholesome premise and idyllic island setting, even &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t avoid becoming an odd casualty in the wake of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY4tv3"&gt;Since last November, my Switch has mostly sat next to my bed, untouched. There are other games on it, of course, but I think of it as an &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; machine, especially after all the hours I sank into Beef House last year. It was a mainline to so many things I couldn’t do in real life, like hanging out with friends and “traveling” (albeit to other virtual islands). I followed &lt;em&gt;ACNH&lt;/em&gt; community projects, played the stalk market with turnips, and went to in-game swap meets as the world struggled through various degrees of quarantine or lockdown. It’s supposed to be a real-time experience to be played at your own pace — on the commute to work or between chores — but the pandemic drastically changed the way people approached the game. It became a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/11/21363470/animal-crossing-new-horizons-binging-slowdown-played-speed"&gt;bingeable distraction&lt;/a&gt;, especially with in-game time travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kn1pZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am ashamed of facing them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y9sDZa"&gt;And so, after pouring hundreds of hours into Beef House, I needed a break. I’d re-terraformed, bought every upgrade, and amassed a dragon’s hoard of bells. The first couple of weeks that I forgot to log in and buy turnips felt like weird faux-financial FOMO, but the feeling quickly passed. But after a couple of months dropping off the &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; radar, I realized that I wasn’t alone in feeling guilty about leaving. There were others who also felt a curious anxiety about ghosting the game that had gotten them through the start of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6DUCp"&gt;This particular form of anxiety isn’t even about avoiding the weeds and cockroaches that appear after a prolonged absence. “It’s a deep psychological fear,” says musician and game developer Mabel Harper, who hasn’t played &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; for at least nine months. “Intellectually, I know I’m not disappointing my &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; friends… but I feel like I’ve left them high and dry, and I am ashamed of facing them.” Harper did go back once last summer for a virtual Tinder date but hasn’t touched it since. “The way the people in the older games would just kinda shame you about not constantly being there has put the fear of god in me,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxQOO0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/being-ghosted-during-pandemic"&gt;Ghosting&lt;/a&gt; has become a much more common practice simply because we’ve become &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/angry-nerd-online-dating-pandemic-ghosting/"&gt;so unmoored&lt;/a&gt; from normal social practices. This doesn’t just apply to dating — it’s happening at &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/16/coronavirus-stress-ghosting-employer/"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a32320157/social-isolation-ghosting-friends/"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;, and even family. I’d tried ghosting a friend in the years before perma-online living and Facebook only to have her turn up at my doorstep, ready for an explanation: &lt;em&gt;What is going on? Where have you been?&lt;/em&gt; But with so many of our connections being mediated by apps and screens, why wouldn’t this phenomenon of ghost-guilt also extend to game characters, especially ones deliberately designed to do just that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7AHK"&gt;Copywriter Ili Nadirah felt so bad about neglecting her island that she reset the game and made a new one. She believes her guilt is partly due to a reflexive attachment to inanimate objects. “If in my drawer there’s three spoons, if I keep using two spoons and not the other spoon, I’ll feel… bad,” Nadirah explains. “It’s the same feeling I get with the villagers. Every day that I don’t talk to them it’s like ‘oh my god, they were waiting for me.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e28dQP"&gt;While I didn’t have such an egalitarian friendship with my villagers — I shunned Lionel for weeks to make him leave — my mind immediately jumped to Merengue, the last of my three original starter villagers who had kept me company during lockdown last year. Merengue, who had come to my house to look for me. Merengue, a Beef House resident from day one. I felt worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQ3HmgK3Gzb_kvIM7nV9CC4AjaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379691/2021031615501100_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4PNfuw"&gt;Nadirah simply didn’t want to face her villagers again. “It’s fine, rather than hearing them saying ‘oh no, I’ve missed you,’ or ‘you missed someone’s birthday.’ I can’t deal with that kind of emotional blackmail,” she says. “I just feel like if I can reset everything, it’s much easier. It’s much easier to burn bridges and connect with new people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2M0pZ"&gt;Harper — like me — believes she’s projecting some of her own avoidant tendencies onto her villagers. She compared the Great Return to going home for Christmas after you haven’t seen your family in two years. “I am the type of person to fall madly in love with someone, but when it’s been a week or two since we’ve talked, I just assume it’s hopeless and there’s no point saying ‘hey,’ and I feel that way about my villagers, sans the madly in love part,” she says. “I’m trying to get better at consistency, and I feel like &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; might be good practice… but I gotta get over that initial hump of shame… and having to reflect on myself for being this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hm9qYy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Oh great, more people I’ve ghosted, except they’re virtual animal people.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lCb8JB"&gt;So where does &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; stand now that we’re stumbling through the first quarter of 2021? It’s not the intense escapist delight it used to be, especially for so many of us who used it as a vital portal to human connection. I still haven’t played through the whole cycle of a year — I’m missing fish and bugs and sea creatures, so there are incentives for me to get back into it. But perhaps the game was tethered too closely to a time we’d all rather not dwell on, when our respective worlds were far too small and strained. It turns out that two things can be true — that &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; was both the definitive &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/animal-crossing-covid-coronavirus-popularity-millennials.html"&gt;game of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; (if there ever was one), as well as an unexpected stage for unrealized social anxiety. “The game was such a joy, and now it’s this cursed object waiting for me to return,” Harper says. “It’s just like... oh great, more people I’ve ghosted, except they’re virtual animal people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D7JHG"&gt;Perhaps, like Harper says,&lt;em&gt; New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; could be used as a practice tool for people to come to terms with light pandemic ghosting. After I got over the fear of confronting the rest of my villagers — Marshal hadn’t even noticed my absence — I was left feeling empty and unmotivated. There was so much to do on the island: weeding, stomping on the cockroaches that had infested my house, picking fruit, checking the shops. I didn’t want to do any of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VUbyqI"&gt;But my villagers knew I was back, and they were happy to see me even though I’d ditched them — a new emotional fiction that &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;can offer as we maneuver through post-pandemic relationship dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s latest gaming laptops can now be configured with Cherry MX switches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_0zYZDwXDjIK0ppak_gDbITOyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986482/cfaulkner_200826_4165_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R3 is pictured here, though the switches can only be configured on the latest R4.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lrIud"&gt;Alienware and Cherry have worked together to cram what both companies are calling the “first true” mechanical keyboard into a gaming laptop. Starting March 18th, you’ll be able to purchase Alienware’s M15 R4 or M17 R4 laptops and upgrade them to a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard for an extra $150 at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZSGfR"&gt;The laptops will house a new kind of Cherry switch called the MX Ultra Low Profile, which is 3.5mm thick (compared to the 11.9mm-sized MX Low Profile switch). The switch is built with stainless steel wings that swing open and push down — picture the way a DeLorean’s car doors open and close. (Cherry not-so-subtly teased these new switches with a picture of the famously heavy car that’s built with stainless steel). The rest of the switch is made of thermoplastic polymer that can withstand high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVfZJxzskkZnOb5wdg0lA5ua_RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374417/mxultralow.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Cherry&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVigzC"&gt;Cherry touts 1.8mm of total travel for this switch, which the company says provides a satisfying amount of feedback. The design of the switch is also said to improve typing accuracy, as well as self-clean with each press to prevent particles from messing it up over time. And, based on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Alienware/status/1372216233819521028"&gt;this tweet from Alienware&lt;/a&gt;, the switches seem like they’ll have that signature “thock” sound that’s associated with mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZCqlwKKSWvzB9bDfQJvHKGjedw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374420/GIF_ULP.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Cherry&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MX Ultra Low switch in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDyBrI"&gt;As for its integration into the latest Alienware M15 and M17 R4 laptops, the companies say that the laptop designs didn’t need to be tweaked at all to accommodate the new Cherry switch. The lids will still close just fine, which seems like a testament to how thin the switch is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez22W9"&gt;When you purchase the Cherry upgrade, you’ll get per-key RGB backlighting and AlienFX customization, along with full N-key rollover with anti-ghosting, so it won’t get overloaded when you’re pressing a lot of keys at once. One thing to note is that when you get the keyboard upgrade, all keys, aside from the function row, will have the Cherry MX Ultra Low Profile switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fz524"&gt;I haven’t had the chance to try out these new switches, so I can’t attest to how they feel compared not only to other Cherry MX switches but to the switches Alienware typically uses as well. Admittedly, $150 is a steep add-on for a laptop that’s already going to cost you a lot of money, but it could end up being a good investment if you’re obsessed with mechanical keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
