    <title>Nvidia confirms it accidentally unlocked RTX 3060 Ethereum mining</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HKLoOG"&gt;Nvidia made a big deal about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;reducing the hash rate of Ethereum mining&lt;/a&gt; on its new RTX 3060 graphics card last month. A special system was supposed to make the RTX 3060 undesirable for cryptominers, but Nvidia has now confirmed that it has accidentally unlocked those restrictions with a new driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuV5dd"&gt;“A developer driver inadvertently included code used for internal development which removes the hash rate limiter on RTX 3060 in some configurations,” says an Nvidia spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The driver has been removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adeddj"&gt;While Nvidia has now removed the driver, the genie is out of the bottle. Nvidia’s latest 470.05 beta driver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331537/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining"&gt;automatically unlocks performance for most RTX 3060 cards&lt;/a&gt;, boosting hashing rates for Ethereum mining. Mirrors of the driver can easily be found online, and Nvidia won’t be able to prevent RTX 3060 owners from continuing to use this driver in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="depzAx"&gt;Nvidia originally restricted RTX 3060 mining performance in an attempt to steer cryptominers away from purchasing the cards. The GPU maker seemed confident that its restrictions couldn’t be defeated, even claiming it wasn’t just a driver holding back performance. “It’s not just a driver thing,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bdelrizzo/status/1362619264423747590"&gt;said Bryan Del Rizzo&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s head of communications, last month. “There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyEI7R"&gt;Nvidia clearly wasn’t expecting to release a driver that would accidentally unlock its own restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e0zF8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California bans ‘dark patterns’ that trick users into giving away their personal data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dark Patterns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z0jHw7iZ1zVaumlo4n_S6R8-PNA=/34x0:1066x688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973341/ui_static.1419979789.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Patterns put obstacles between the user and what they want to achieve. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M8ngF3"&gt;If you’ve ever struggled through a maze of online customer service to cancel a subscription or delete an account, you’ve likely encountered “dark patterns” — user interfaces that are designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you"&gt;trick and frustrate users&lt;/a&gt;. The concept was coined in 2010 but is slowly being addressed in US legislation, with California this week announcing that it is banning the use of dark patterns that stop users from opting out of the sale of their personal data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWs3Am"&gt;The updated regulation strengthens enforcement of the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17509720/california-consumer-privacy-act-legislation-law-vote"&gt;toughest consumer privacy laws&lt;/a&gt; in the US. The CCPA gives Californians the right “to say no to the sale of personal information,” but the state government is evidently worried that these options will be buried under byzantine menus. By banning dark patterns, California will “ensure that consumers will not be confused or misled when seeking to exercise their data privacy rights,” said the state’s Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-approval-additional-regulations-empower-data"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3jyf2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/CCPA%20March%2015%20Regs.pdf"&gt;newly-approved regulation&lt;/a&gt; does not ban all uses of dark patterns, only those that have “the substantial effect of subverting or impairing a consumer’s choice to opt-out” of schemes where their personal data is being sold. The regulation offers a number of examples of such dark patterns, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1V19Rp"&gt;Using confusing language like double-negatives (eg “Don’t Not Sell My Personal Information”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="smno7K"&gt;Forcing users to “click through or listen to reasons why they should not submit a request to opt-out before confirming their request.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ldxQFG"&gt;Requiring users to “search or scroll through the text of a privacy policy or similar document or webpage to locate the mechanism for submitting a request to opt-out.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plhD1aLRe7fmr0Xsu0bQx93mVYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374182/california_privacy_opt_out_button.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: California Office of Administrative Law&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The “Privacy Options Opt-Out Icon.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3EHp41"&gt;Businesses found not to be in compliance with the CCPA are sent a “notice to cure,” giving them a 30-day window to amend their services. According to Becerra’s office: “Since CCPA enforcement began on July 1, 2020, the Department has seen widespread compliance by companies doing business in California, especially in response to notices to cure.” To help standardize access to these opt-out schemes, the state of California has even designed what it calls an “eye-catching” icon that companies can use to direct users to exercise their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuY1Li"&gt;Although this legislation only bans dark patterns in specific scenarios, there have been other attempts to crack down on such deceptive design more generally. In 2019, Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Deb Fischer (R-NE) introduced a bill that would ban internet platforms with more than 100 million users from using any dark patterns that trick users into handing over personal data. The bill, though, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s1084"&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; received a vote in congress. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite season 6 adds animals, crafting, Lara Croft, and Neymar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7LZ9-UMaP51_HPSjGPcWlW2WEY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973192/EN_16BR_Social_KeyArt_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHr4lM"&gt;A new season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is upon us, and the latest digs even deeper into the battle royale’s reality-spanning narrative. Today, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-2-season-6"&gt;officially launched season 6&lt;/a&gt; of the game’s second chapter, which is dubbed “Primal.” It takes place directly after the “Zero Crisis Finale” that concluded season 5 and introduces a new prehistoric biome to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utJYvp"&gt;When players start playing the season for the first time, they’ll be greeted with a quick cinematic — which you can watch below — following a short-yet-intense single-player adventure where you help Agent Jonesy attempt to save reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7g3viH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNWaHd8tj2E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="534lll"&gt;That new setting includes a towering spire in the center of the island — right where the zero point explosion from season 5 took place — which is surrounded by a village and other new locations, replacing the alien desert from last season. Perhaps more significant is that animals now roam the island, including everything from wolves and wild boar to seemingly more harmless creatures like chicken and frogs. Along with this is a new crafting mechanic that lets players build makeshift weapons, like new bows, from hunted wildlife and discarded technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UtR0Rz2Wl9hhBkOIaxnsp1GWbqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374161/EN_CH2S06_MiniMap_1080x1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zj3oyB"&gt;Additionally, those who pick up the battle pass can expect the usual assortment of new character skins and other cosmetic items to unlock. This time around that includes characters connected to the ongoing story, like Agent Jones, as well as someone called the “Spire Assassin,” and Raz, described as “seeker of The Spire’s mysteries.” Of course, it wouldn’t be &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; without licensed tie-ins. This season those come in the form of Lara Croft from &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, Raven from &lt;em&gt;Teen Titans,&lt;/em&gt; and, at some point in the future, Brazilian soccer star Neymar (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330003/epic-games-fortnite-brazilian-soccer-star-neymar"&gt;as expected&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPj7oS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s previous season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;started last December&lt;/a&gt;, and it similarly began with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;an impressive live event that capped off its Marvel-themed storyline&lt;/a&gt; — which turned out to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21921491/fortnite-galactus-live-event-player-count"&gt;the game’s biggest event to date&lt;/a&gt;. However, season 5 will likely be best-remembered for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;the sheer number of licensed tie-ins&lt;/a&gt;, spanning everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;professional sports&lt;/a&gt;. Those looking to dig a bit deeper into the ever-evolving &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore can also check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;an upcoming Batman crossover comic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new gaming-focused earbuds play nicely with USB-C devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G333" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qs4TEudqlmI2HdwuR4VNSEeNgAg=/0x0:5851x3901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973117/g333lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DCXyKb"&gt;Logitech’s latest earbuds, a $50 model called the G333, are unremarkable in terms of design, with a flat cable that houses an inline remote and mic, swappable silicone ear tips, and the ability to connect to gadgets via a 3.5mm jack. What makes them stand out is the included 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3X2Wu"&gt;If your phone or other audio device lacks a headphone jack but has a USB-C port to spare, you’re all set to plug in with this model. With the adapter attached, I had no issues hooking up the G333 to my 3.5mm-less Pixel 3, my Nintendo Switch, or through a USB-C port on the MacBook Pro I use for work. Also included with these earbuds are two additional sizes of silicone ear tips and a small mesh carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWFwqz"&gt;The G333 looks almost identical to Logitech’s other two gaming earbuds: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439854/logitech-g-pro-g333-headphones-earbuds-gaming-headset-oculus-quest-2-ready-vr"&gt;$50 G333 VR&lt;/a&gt; headphones (which are certified for the Oculus Quest 2) and the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21494174/astro-a03-in-ear-headphones-monitor-earbuds-gaming-nintendo-switch-pc-chat-playstation-xbox"&gt;Astro A03 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The added value here is the USB-C adapter, which is included for the same price. So if you’re trying to decide between them, the new G333 are the most feature-packed for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G333" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWh30fUSjC_OyU5wAm_Gqo2_1VI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22371741/logitechg333product.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each set of Logitech’s G333 includes a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter, swappable ear tips, and a small mesh carrying case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wXcQXd"&gt;The G333 earbuds seem to have the same dual dynamic drivers as those aforementioned models, and their overall performance was similar in my testing. If you aren’t expecting much (considering the price), I think you’ll be impressed with their sound quality. There’s plenty of bass, but it doesn’t muddle the sound. My biggest nitpick against them is that the silicone ear tips don’t always want to stay in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNch5"&gt;Logitech’s new earbuds will be available in three colorways: black with blue details, dark purple with neon yellow detailing, and lastly, silver with light purple detailing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new Windows 10 update fixes the issue where some printers would crash computers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRO4bUWP7qvp51rf_hEI5vxMJ3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971939/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yoajye"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/march-15-2021-kb5001566-os-build-18363-1441-out-of-band-23c4c824-8638-43e9-a381-ff58213ae6fe"&gt;is fixing&lt;/a&gt; the issue where trying to use certain printers would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326083/windows-10-security-update-bug-printer-crash-kyocera-ricoh-zebra-microsoft"&gt;freak out your Windows 10 computer and cause it to blue screen&lt;/a&gt;. If you (or your IT department) have been dealing with the issue, today’s update should let you get back to printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs4Asm"&gt;In the update notes, Microsoft says that the issue only affected “certain printers using some apps,” but doesn't clarify which. It seemed to impact some printers from Kyocera, Ricoh, and Zebra, and if you owned one it’s the type of error that would be extremely annoying — or worse, workflow-breaking, if printing’s a need and not something you just do occasionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgvLuh"&gt;If this issue has been affecting you, you can download the update by going to Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Update, and clicking Check for Updates. Hopefully, after updating, your printer and computer can go back to being friends again. May the ink once again meet the paper, and your computer not have to be rebooted from a hard crash.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub employee fired for saying ‘Nazi’ in Slack declines to take his job back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Agrees To Buy Coding Site GitHub For $7.5 Billion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0fRiL5OtMfm0DKvxsoBBL4FoTo=/0x2:3000x2002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971773/967228286.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HNb7dZ"&gt;A Jewish GitHub employee who was fired for warning co-workers in Slack to stay safe from Nazis during the January 6th attack on the US Capitol has declined to take his job back after an offer from the company, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/fired-github-employee-reaches-amicable-resolution-with-company/"&gt;GitHub told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dw8KWM"&gt;“We offered the employee his job back immediately after reviewing the investigation findings, and he declined,” a GitHub spokesperson said to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. GitHub shared the same statement with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S88vtj"&gt;“Me and the company reached an amicable resolution,” the employee said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.” The terms of the resolution are unclear, but the employee had “previously told me he was seeking damages or some other form of reconciliation,” &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzA3PY"&gt;GitHub fired the employee two days after he wrote “stay safe homies, Nazis are about” to colleagues in Slack on January 6th, as &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 200 of the company’s 1,700 employees signed an open letter asking the company for an explanation, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232766/github-employees-protest-jewish-employee-firing-warn-nazi"&gt;employees began using the word “Nazi” in Slack&lt;/a&gt; to describe the Capitol rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jknQFR"&gt;Following an independent investigation, GitHub CEO Nat Friedman admitted that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22235913/github-significant-mistakes-were-made-firing-jewish-employee-nazis"&gt;significant mistakes were made&lt;/a&gt;” in an internal message to employees on January 16th, and the company offered the employee his job back. The company’s head of HR also resigned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;NFTs are seemingly everywhere — and now they're all right here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="wSSItB"&gt;NFT’s are the Big Thing in tech news right now, from people trying to figure out just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;what the heck a non-fungible token is&lt;/a&gt;, to concerns about them furthering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the climate crisis because of the energy requirements that can come with blockchain technology&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Get the Nintendo Switch Lite with a $20 gift card for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFTIvFsKez_trhgyuwcaRZ3uzHA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971574/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A0Mt8t"&gt;Not everyone takes advantage of the “switch” aspect of the Nintendo Switch, and for them, the smaller, easier-to-carry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; is a worthwhile alternative. A few retailers are now tossing in a free $20 gift card when you purchase Nintendo’s more compact handheld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4ctVf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V2BBMK4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734996775790451200#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-gray%2F204518.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; are all offering the deal, and all Switch Lite colors are eligible. So regardless of whether you prefer gray, yellow, blue, or coral, you’ll end up with an extra $20 to spend at the retailer you’re buying it from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L7QqeX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10394076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8I1dA"&gt;By going with the Lite model, you lose the ability to dock the Switch to a TV, and features like HD rumble are also omitted from the smaller hardware. But at least you get a better d-pad and sturdier design in exchange. And the downsized screen is the same resolution, so some people think it actually looks &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; thanks to the improved pixel density. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWHAlV"&gt;With the extra $20, you can grab yourself a game on sale (or put it towards a must-buy like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274990/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), a screen protector, or maybe a carrying case. The Switch Lite isn’t as hard to come by as the regular Switch, which continues to face supply shortages, but it’s still proven to be a hit with many Nintendo fans as their main or secondary console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird will double its size in Europe with massive $150 million spend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Milan’s Urban Mobility Reshaped By Scooters And Bike-Shares" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fRGZrveGyatRTUAmcg0lYbb9gE=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971379/1276437584.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLZjN2"&gt;Bird says it will spend $150 million on a major expansion in Europe. The Santa Monica-based scooter sharing company announced that it will bring its battery-powered two-wheelers to 50 new cities on the continent in the coming months, in addition to growing its fleet in its current markets. The move comes as scooter sharing continues to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/vc-investors-are-wild-for-europes-e-scooter-rental-startups.html"&gt;perform strongly in Europe&lt;/a&gt; amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKHvuW"&gt;To help oversee this new initiative, Bird is promoting to two employees to its executive team: Renaud Fages is named head of global operations; and Brendan O’Driscoll will be head of product, growth and data, overseeing both Bird’s global product strategy and its implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W9aZVI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Europe is playing a leading role”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtju1o"&gt;“Europe is playing a leading role not only in embracing micro-EVs, but in redesigning cities to safely promote their use,” said Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKetJi"&gt;Bird said that portions of its $150 million investment will be spent “implementing the next generation of recycling and second life applications for vehicles, investing in industry-leading equity programs and securing partnerships across the region designed to improve transportation for all Europeans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJWo1A"&gt;Since it first arrived in Paris in 2019, Bird has seen huge potential for growth in Europe, with its more robust network of bike lanes and a culture less dependent on personally owned vehicles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083751/bird-acquires-circ-electric-scooter-europe-asia"&gt;Bird acquired Circ&lt;/a&gt;, a leading electric scooter rental business in Europe and the Middle East, in January 2020. And the company now operates in over 50 cities on the continent, meaning this new investment will represent a doubling of Bird’s current footprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmnPQn"&gt;But the company has also seen a number of setbacks too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335611/paris-electric-scooter-competition-lime-tier-dott-bird"&gt;Bird did not ultimately win one of the coveted permits&lt;/a&gt; to operate its scooters in Paris, &lt;a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/tourisme-transport/tier-lime-et-dott-raflent-le-marche-londonien-de-la-trottinette-electrique-1294014"&gt;nor does it appear to be on track&lt;/a&gt; to be granted a license in London either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhZWav"&gt;Bird has grown increasingly reliant on revenue from its franchising program, in which the company sells its older scooters to small operators and takes a cut of each ride. The program, which is called Bird Platform, has led some operators to fall into deep debt, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/bird-is-quietly-luring-contract-workers-into-debt-through-a-new-scooter-scheme-3fa34fb4a0f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company has since launched Bird Platform in countries like Switzerland and Estonia, cheering investors who hope it will lower Bird’s labor and capital expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYb8iV"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/after-tough-year-spacs-tempt-bird-lime"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Bird was nearing a deal to raise more than $100 million in convertible debt from some of its existing investors. The debt, which could eventually be converted into stock, would help Bird avoid selling shares at a lower price than in earlier fundraising rounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7hy93"&gt;The company is also doubling down on direct-to-consumer sales, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448941/bird-air-electric-scooter-announce-price-specs"&gt;unveiling its $599 Bird Air &lt;/a&gt;last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India will reportedly introduce bill to make owning cryptocurrency illegal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TuZfbT6AJIj5UncEwNG4iLDVHmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971166/mdoying_180308_2373_0091still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E1UM3B"&gt;India is reportedly moving forward with a sweeping ban on cryptocurrencies. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cryptocurrency-ban/india-to-propose-cryptocurrency-ban-penalising-miners-traders-source-idUSKBN2B60R0"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the country’s legislature will introduce a bill that criminalizes trading, mining, issuing, transferring, or possessing cryptocurrency. The bill is likely to pass if it’s introduced, giving India some of the world’s strictest digital currency laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFomoo"&gt;Under the plan, people who own these digital assets would have six months to liquidate their holdings. &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; source, a government official, didn’t specify the punishment for breaking the rules after that. But a 2019 government panel recommended a jail sentence of up to 10 years for cryptocurrency-related offenses. The official says the discussions are in their “final stages,” although there’s no strict timeline for introducing the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pTti"&gt;The Indian government &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANTVg2GJYkmVpDg-m9DEVgD9JUp1wMIZoZsO5FtdJPNvp8Mr_qb4UZrDQ695KbtwcFyZUdUASR1qhHDcg1ToEWe3YnwukJaWt-su65i9Q1fgaTcZUPUHWqwybgbgzDcQoR-Yl0PQkVw6zWfgErdSt3MhZDT-tHeUZLTzVsRgAy2M"&gt;outlined its plans in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it published an agenda for the upcoming legislative session. That agenda included banning “all private cryptocurrencies” in India, with some exceptions to promote the general use of blockchain technology. The goal is to roll out an official government-issued digital currency while outlawing private alternatives like Bitcoin — which reached &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-bitcoin/bitcoin-hits-record-high-trades-as-high-as-59755-on-saturday-idUSKBN2B50B1?il=0"&gt;a record high&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, trading at $59,755.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn9Wbx"&gt;No other large country has implemented this kind of ban on cryptocurrency. China, which has some of the harshest policies, &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-didnt-ban-bitcoin-entirely-says-beijing-arbitration-commission"&gt;prohibits trading coins&lt;/a&gt; but does not outlaw owning them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhCezp"&gt;The in-progress proposal follows a years-long fight between cryptocurrency traders and the Indian government. India’s central bank cracked down on Bitcoin in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43669730"&gt;banning banks&lt;/a&gt; from dealing in virtual currencies. Its Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/india-lifts-ban-on-cryptocurrency-trading/"&gt;overturned the decision&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, but it didn’t necessarily preclude passing a new, even stricter law — like what’s on the table now.&lt;/p&gt;
