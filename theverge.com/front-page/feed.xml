    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThshmO"&gt;Lisa Bloom, the celebrity lawyer who represented Bill O’Reilley’s, Donald Trump’s, and Bill Cosby’s sexual assault accusers, as well as once advising Harvey Weinstein in his sexual assault case, has announced that she will be holding a press conference on behalf of one of the survivors involved in the numerous sexual assault, harassment, and discrimination allegations against Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJParL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I represent a Blizzard employee who alleges she's a victim of sexual harassment. Our press release for our press conference tomorrow at the Irvine headquarters where we will demand accountability for the victims who have been subjected to harassment at the video game company: &lt;a href="https://t.co/0PisZ1Zomr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0PisZ1Zomr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LisaBloom/status/1468299060826177538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3h7hdE"&gt;The press conference, announced today in a press release from Bloom’s firm, will take place at Blizzard’s Irvine, California, headquarters and feature a statement from the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuzoeH"&gt;According to the press release, the woman is a current employee at Blizzard Entertainment and will “describe the alcohol-soaked culture of sexual harassment [...] and the retaliation she experienced after she reported the sexual harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="letN6Q"&gt;Though numerous people have spoken out about their experiences at the company, this press conference will be the first time a current employee has publicly come forward. The press conference will be streamed at 12PM ET Wednesday, December 8th, on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisabloomesq/"&gt;Lisa Bloom’s Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G now means some flights won’t be able to land when pilots can’t see the runway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TELECOMMUNICATION-5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2SmjVL7gqjAmGsnakw9rhoCE4s=/0x0:3890x2593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241822/1187777089.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Je3AF2"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are hoping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;new swaths of C-band cellular radio spectrum&lt;/a&gt; will help make the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;5G hype&lt;/a&gt; closer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;, but the big mid-band 5G rollout may have a side effect. Airplanes rely on radio altimeters to tell how high they are above the ground to safely land when pilots can’t see, and the FAA is now instructing 6,834 of them to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;do that &lt;/em&gt;at certain airports because of 5G interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wk7L8d"&gt;The FAA ruled on Tuesday that those thousands of US planes (and some helicopters) won’t be able to use many of the guided and automatic landing systems that are designed to work in poor visibility conditions if they’re landing at an airport where there’s deemed to be enough interference that their altimeters aren’t reliable. “Landings during periods of low visibility could be limited due to concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” an FAA spokesman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BIp4pP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These limitations could prevent dispatch of flights ... and could also result in flight diversions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ry5ywH"&gt;That likely means flight delays: “These limitations could prevent dispatch of flights to certain locations with low visibility, and could also result in flight diversions,” reads a portion &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statement-5g"&gt;of the FAA’s written explanation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThSiaf"&gt;“We are engaged with the wireless operators, as well as our interagency partners, to do everything possible to make sure the mitigations are tailored to prevent disruptions,” an FAA spokesman tells us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOc6AS"&gt;The FAA ruling does give airlines and pilots an out — if they can prove their airplanes have altimeters that are protected or are otherwise not going to be affected by interference. No airline would comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on expected delays, nor would the Airlines for America industry group that the airlines pointed us to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrVvSn"&gt;It’s not yet clear which specific airports might restrict low visibility flight, but you can imagine that they’d likely be in the same places where the carriers are deploying mid-band 5G — with a few exceptions, they’re the United States’ most-populated cities. As of December, &lt;a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/dc7bd4f27e5f107486257221005f069d/27ffcbb45e6157e9862587810044ad19/%24FILE/AIR-21-18.pdf"&gt;the planned rollouts (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; are in 46 markets designated as Partial Economic Areas (PEAs), including 1-4, 6-10, 12- 19, 21-41, and 43-50. (You can see them all &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-14-759A2.pdf"&gt;here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.) The FAA plans to issue notices for specific airports later.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FphoGu"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T did agree to push back the launch of C-band by one month (to January 2022), and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801008/verizon-att-midband-5g-c-band-lower-power-six-months"&gt;offered to dial back the power of 5G towers for six months&lt;/a&gt; past that to address concerns. Carriers and their lobbying group, the CTIA, have suggested that there isn’t a valid reason to fear interference, but the FAA has so far not been convinced. Nor was an aviation lobbying group, the Aerospace Industries Association, which sent a letter to the FCC on Monday suggesting that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s proposed power limits don’t go far enough for safety. The FCC, not the FAA, is the entity that regulates wireless interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUyLUY"&gt;While C-band 5G and these radio altimeters don’t actually operate in the same band, the bands are close enough that the fear exists. One possible solution is a band filter for those altimeters, but organizations like the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) &lt;a href="https://www.rtca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Webinar-QA-11.30.20-1.pdf"&gt;have warned (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; that it might take years to certify them and retrofit all the planes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing changes to the way it handles reported tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HJ4fPAeNyTAPCiy1GfKTNzW0D0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241741/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is testing a new way to report abusive tweets | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dXkWQi"&gt;Twitter says it is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/common-thread/en/topics/stories/2021/twitters-new-reporting-process-centers-on-a-human-first-design"&gt;testing an overhaul&lt;/a&gt; to the process for reporting tweets, which it says will ultimately make it easier for users to alert the company to abusive or suspicious behavior. The approach being tested with a small group of users in the US streamlines the current reporting process so that a person reporting a tweet doesn’t have to choose from a list of pre-selected descriptions of what rule a tweet is violating. Instead, the company says, it will ask the user what happened in a “symptoms-first” approach to gather more complete information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JrtpE"&gt;The blog post used the example of a patient in an emergency; the doctor doesn’t ask them, “Is your leg broken?” but rather, “Where does it hurt?” instead. Brian Waismeyer, a data scientist on the health user experience team overseeing the new process, said asking someone to identify a specific issue or symptom isn’t an effective way to find out what’s wrong. “If they’re walking in to get help, what they’re going to do well is describe what is happening to them in the moment,” he said of the patient in the broken leg example. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WKqp6QF7eqG-BknEB_sPs6kXNtA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071195/twitter_report_tweets.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is testing changes to how it handles reported tweets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HQjy1h"&gt;“What can be frustrating and complex about reporting is that we enforce based on terms of service violations as defined by the Twitter Rules,” senior Twitter UX manager Renna Al-Yassini said in a statement. “The vast majority of what people are reporting on fall within a much larger gray spectrum that don’t meet the specific criteria of Twitter violations, but they’re still reporting what they are experiencing as deeply problematic and highly upsetting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdXl18"&gt;Twitter says by shifting the focus to the person reporting the tweet, it hopes to improve the quality of reports it receives; the more first-hand details it can gather, the more precise it can be when deciding how to handle a reported tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TE992E"&gt;This is the first time in a while that Twitter has made significant changes to its tweet reporting process, other than adding new reasons to report a tweet, such as for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629097/twitter-misinformation-health-covid19-reporting-feature-white-house"&gt;spreading coronavirus misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and tweeting false information about elections such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115487/twitter-elections-facebook-youtube-warren-iowa-caucuses"&gt;voter suppression&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, it gave users the ability to add more details about tweets being reported for sharing personal information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtIHZh"&gt;Twitter said the new reporting process will be rolled out to a wider audience in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jzZD4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SHd8D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iKoE9g"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Spectre x360 14. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop for video editing and intensive work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ip0i0W"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QRlaQ5"&gt;The best creator laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LyoNCb"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the most powerful laptop Apple has ever made. If you’re willing to pay the price (and it’s a steep price), you’ll almost certainly be satisfied with what this machine can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svZAry"&gt;In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The 16-inch configuration with the M1 Pro processor lasted 16 hours in my testing — making it the longest-lasting laptop we’ve ever reviewed. (The M1 Max configuration doesn’t last quite as long, but still got us through a work day.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imgWnf"&gt;Elsewhere, we have basically no complaints about the newest MacBook Pro. It has a gorgeous display that can reach 1,000 nits when playing HDR content. It pairs that with the best set of speakers we’ve ever heard from a laptop. If you’re looking for a machine that can accommodate a demanding workload while also serving as an excellent multimedia device when you’re off the clock, the MacBook Pro 16 is the best device for you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7399sH"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u8MTQ2"&gt;If you’re a creative professional who doesn’t quite want to pay the price of the MacBook Pro 16, or you’re looking for something more compact, you’re probably better suited to the 14-inch MacBook Pro. This device is thinner, lighter, and less expensive than its 16-inch counterpart, but it comes with the same monstrous processor options and the same stellar screen, albeit at a smaller size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3aJPr"&gt;We didn’t see much of a difference in benchmark scores between the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks with the same processors — the 14-incher actually outperformed the 16-inchers in some of our tests. The primary difference to consider, apart from the sizes of these devices, is battery life. The 16-inch chassis allows for a significantly bigger battery, and the 16-inch M1 Pro model lasted several hours longer than the 14-inch M1 Pro model did in our testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8RJE4"&gt;On the outside, Apple has fixed many of the issues that reviewers had with previous MacBook Pro models. There are ports galore on this device, including an HDMI, an SD slot, and multiple Thunderbolt 4 ports. The much-maligned Touchbar is also no more. While you can get plenty of great 14-inch laptops for half the price of this MacBook, it’s the one to buy if money is no object.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3W3TFs"&gt;The best 15-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wVrlpW"&gt;Asus surprised us this year with its Chromebook Flip CX5, a gorgeous $800 laptop that happens to run Chrome OS. It’s as sturdy and well-built as all kinds of Windows laptops at higher price points, and sports a unique smooth texture. It includes fully-fledged laptop specs, including Intel’s 11th-Gen processors and a 57Wh battery, which provide speedy performance, long battery life, and quick charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt9eBq"&gt;You get all kinds of ports, including an HDMI and a microSD slot. The speakers sound great, and the keyboard is comfortable. Asus hasn’t skimped on CX5’s chassis or its performance — it’s absolutely the product to buy if you’re looking for a Chromebook with a big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads that’s not as mind-numbingly expensive as the most recent releases, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best multimedia laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMlQz"&gt;Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd1MYR"&gt;There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The global chip shortage is partially to blame for Final Fantasy XIV’s long queues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6BnyHjGewAHA8e2j9eA_2YDfxtc=/0x21:1212x829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241623/9b6e6f1b787a32e4291e1cc7e7e0719e_1920_KR.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SLi4yG"&gt;Many players eager to jump into&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s highly anticipated &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; expansion have hit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822793/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-early-access-server-queues"&gt;big queues&lt;/a&gt; since the game launched in early access on Friday. Part of the reason for the long waits is that the global chip shortage has prevented Square Enix from getting enough servers to handle demand, &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/4269a50a754b4f83a99b49341324153ef4405c13"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from producer and director Naoki Yoshida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwtwUg"&gt;“When it comes to adding new Worlds, we need tens of ‘server machines’ for every World that we add,” Yoshida says. “Server machines are high-performance computers, which utilize numerous semiconductors. However, due to the COVID-19 countermeasures currently in place, many factories across the globe which produce semiconductors, have halted production or have faced labor shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RTIeXo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A long lead time will be needed to prepare the server hardware”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TWvlUC"&gt;“We have made considerable investment — even more so than usual — to secure the required hardware, but even so, a long lead time will be needed to prepare the server hardware,” Yoshida added. The development team has taken a few measures to address things in the meantime such as optimizing server source code and upping maximum logins per world. Despite those efforts, “given the current situation, we anticipate that it may take several months or more to add new Worlds,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0z7wh"&gt;The global chip shortage has had a huge effect on many industries — even Apple, renowned for mastery of its supply chain, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;has lost billions due to supply constraints&lt;/a&gt;. Companies of all sizes have had to come up with other solutions to make their products work, like Square Enix did; Panic, for example, revised the main board in its quirky Playdate handheld to support a different CPU, while Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrote its vehicle software to support other chips&lt;/a&gt;. (Tesla has also reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;been shipping some cars without USB ports&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQwRaA"&gt;Yoshida also discussed the server load in a post published &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/2d402ccbc4eb78427223ea9420fa3e81cf20dccf"&gt;hours after &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s early access launch&lt;/a&gt;, and based on what he said then and on Tuesday, it doesn’t seem like Square Enix will be able to fix every issue or procure as much server hardware as it wants to anytime soon. Yoshida has outlined a number of adjustments the development team is making to try and fix some issues, which will hopefully mean you won’t have to wait as long to play &lt;em&gt;Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay introduces an interactive 3D sneaker viewer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Yq3sKmcF7PN03tYntIzmSKD0pg=/217x0:2479x1508/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241557/ebay_3d_viewing_sneaker.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-debuts-new-3d-true-view-feature-for-sneakers/" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pTtpFd"&gt;eBay now lets you get a 360-degree look at some of the sneakers it has for sale, all thanks to its handy new 3D viewing tool, called eBay 3D true view. In a post on &lt;a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-debuts-new-3d-true-view-feature-for-sneakers/"&gt;eBay’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the e-commerce platform said that the feature will let sellers add interactive images of their sneakers to listings. It’s partnering with Unity, a platform that can be used for real-time 3D modeling, to pilot the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MX8w09"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scans of sneakers will be uploaded to the cloud and processed using AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxD6R6"&gt;Starting this month, eBay says that select sneaker sellers will get the chance to try out the feature, however, the 3D images will only be viewable from its iOS or Android app. To use it, sellers will have to use a proprietary app to take a video of their sneakers from all angles. From there, that data is uploaded to the cloud and processed “using AI methodology” (that eBay didn’t elaborate about) resulting in what eBay says is a “photorealistic” 3D recreation of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSrwcj"&gt;While the feature is only available to a limited number of sellers currently, eBay plans to expand it in 2022. Any sneaker sellers interested in using the 3D feature can sign up for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Febay.com%2F3Dwaitlist&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F7%2F22822678%2Febay-sneaker-viewer-3d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;waitlist&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is live on the site right now, and if you’re on mobile, you can start viewing sneakers in 3D &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fe%2Ffashion%2Fsneakers-in-3d-113021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F7%2F22822678%2Febay-sneaker-viewer-3d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from here&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that not every listing has the 3D viewer right now, though, so you might have to tap a few different ones before you find a listing that uses 3D true view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tq9wgv"&gt;eBay continues to dive headfirst into the sneaker market. In October, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514028/ebay-sneaker-con-authentication-100-guarantee-fake-counterfeit-limited-edition"&gt;rolled out a sneaker authentication service&lt;/a&gt; to help combat counterfeiters and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808373/ebay-sneaker-con-acquisition"&gt;bought out the third-party sneaker authentication&lt;/a&gt; company that it was using, called Sneaker Con. eBay isn’t the first online marketplace to implement 3D views of sneakers, however: &lt;a href="https://stockx.pvxt.net/c/482924/530344/9060?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstockx.com%2Fnews%2F360-degree-images-are-live%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;StockX has been offering 360-degree images&lt;/a&gt; of sneakers since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon starts rolling out Smart Home Dashboard and other new features to Fire TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfSkURHYX9IcxEQXKqBn9r-kIQE=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241439/Smart_Home_Dashboard.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwJInB"&gt;Amazon is today beginning to roll out new features and functionality to its lineup of Fire TV streaming devices and the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa"&gt;Fire TV Omni&lt;/a&gt; and 4-Series televisions. At the top of the pile of new tricks is a Smart Home Dashboard that looks similar to what’s already available on the company’s Fire tablets and Echo Show smart displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QPH45"&gt;The dashboard, available in the US and Canada, offers quick access and on / off toggles for connected lights, plugs, and switches that are linked to your Alexa system. Smart cameras get their own row in the dashboard, complete with a thumbnail of their perspective — though not a live view until you actually click into them. Previously, you could control your smart home gadgets with voice commands through the Fire TV’s Alexa Voice Remote, but it’s always nice to have an actual interface on the screen for this stuff. Samsung offers a TV dashboard for its SmartThings platform, and the Apple TV has a semblance of one via Control Center. Amazon says additional features like smart home groups and smart thermostats will be added to the dashboard next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2M59Y"&gt;On the subject of Alexa, Amazon’s also adding what it’s calling an Alexa Shortcut Panel that appears on-screen when you press the remote’s Alexa button. This will get you to “smart home controls, weather, news, and your video library.” The company says this feature will be “broadly” rolled out across Fire TV hardware in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS0zo0"&gt;Amazon is also beefing up the audio side of its Fire TV experience. The company is expanding the ability to use Echo speakers (like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Echo Studio if you’re feeling fancy&lt;/a&gt;) as speakers and bringing that feature to the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; and the Fire TV Omni / 4-Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdSRW4"&gt;On the TVs, Alexa Home Theater supports audio both from streaming apps and connected devices, but Amazon says the same even holds true for the Stick 4K Max so long as it’s plugged into the eARC port on your TV. Sound from other inputs like a game console will be routed through the Alexa Home Theater setup. That’s a first and something the other Fire TV streamers aren’t capable of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ijHUX5"&gt;With Fire TV Omni Series and 4-Series televisions, audio will output when streaming on Fire TV and across any compatible device that’s connected, including cable boxes, gaming consoles, and antenna sources. Fire TV Stick 4K Max can now do the same, so long as it’s plugged into your TV’s HDMI eARC port, which means you can broadcast audio to Echo speakers, even when you’re enjoying content on inputs other than Fire TV. Set-up instructions are &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.amazon.com_gp_help_customer_display.html-3FnodeId-3DGDFMQWDYT5MCAEA4&amp;amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=IGt1VQsTZCfLQH1674IFDQUVoZpbOko0Qdd91-cp1Z0&amp;amp;m=hf8VoHnI165iA-RYtjZ1ldA9Zw_uguHmzto-pqAECfNwbXz1cPRmgRxFbZK8SGNL&amp;amp;s=kzxDwDAZX7elx_fsJo-X7R0l6xGcxbRQUUIlk8D8bH8&amp;amp;e="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgd5pq"&gt;After promising to support Apple’s AirPlay 2 on its Fire TV Omni and 4-Series TVs, that feature is also set to roll out soon — though AirPlay integration is sadly still nowhere to be found on standalone Fire TV streaming devices. And last, Amazon again confirms that Zoom is on its way to the Omni TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tocWqb"&gt;Owners of the first self-branded Amazon TVs will be able to plug a camera into the USB port for videoconferencing. In the coming weeks, you will be able to place and receive Zoom meetings from the biggest screen in your home. After downloading the Zoom app through Fire TV, simply plug a compatible 720p–1080p webcam into the USB port and say, “Alexa, find Zoom” to get set up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EtDgn"&gt;Fire TV owners can expect all of these new features to arrive in the “coming weeks,” according to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker’s early access period didn’t provide much access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsqN_S-AKlRX5kQLGZGAeisYMio=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241384/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kUJcXc"&gt;On December 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s latest expansion launched its early access period, allowing those who preordered the game the opportunity to play &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; in advance of its December 7th release date. Or at least that’s how it was supposed to work. For lots of players, the early-access experience was an exercise in patience. With game servers at max capacity and login queues containing upward of 4,000–8,000 players, if you were in early access and actually got access, you were one of the privileged few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5jyap"&gt;Square Enix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809776/ff14-endwalker-square-enix-log-in-queues-extended-wait-times"&gt;warned players this would happen&lt;/a&gt;. Days before early access began, it published a notice detailing what the company had done to prepare for the inevitable congestion, along with tips to mitigate wait times. Still, after a summer of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; consistently breaking player records, hourslong queues, disconnections, and the player dissatisfaction that accompanies those events seemed inevitable. During peak hours, wait times were as long as six to eight hours on popular servers. And even if a server didn’t have a massive number of people waiting to get in, aspiring Endwalkers could still experience the dreaded “2002 error” which disconnects players from the lobby, forcing them to reenter the queue, sometimes preserving a player’s place in the queue but often times not. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAi7JnBnefLAoCFjl71uLKurO_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070938/queue.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The (comparatively light) queue for my world, Zalera, a low-population server. Typical queues before Endwalker early access were 20–60 players long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fIDBNI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; game director Naoki Yoshida published several posts over the weekend apologizing for the exceedingly long wait times, explaining this early access period has seen the most simultaneous logins in the game’s eight-year history. In addition to outlining everything the development team was doing to increase stability and ease congestion, Yoshida announced that Square Enix would provide players with seven days of free game time. He also shared some insight on the busiest times, so players can maximize their playing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NqhJCz"&gt;Though the congestion status may vary for each logical data center, I’d like to share information regarding the peak hours of congestion we’ve currently observed as of December 5.&lt;br&gt;North American Data Center: 12:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. (PST) / 20:00 to 6:00 (GMT)&lt;br&gt;European Data Center: 3:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (PST) / 11:00 to 23:00 (GMT)&lt;br&gt;Japan Data Center: 1:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. (PST) / 9:00 to 15:00 (GMT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj2GgS"&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; subreddit, players were generally understanding of the extended wait times but expressed dismay over other bugs, errors, and player behavior that exacerbated the already frustrating experience. One of the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/r8ylaj/dear_se_if_youre_going_to_have_a_login_queue_can/"&gt;most upvoted threads for this week&lt;/a&gt; was a post that explained players were fine with waiting but were upset that even patient waiting wouldn’t guarantee them a chance to play with the specter of the “2002 error” looming large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Hg6J1"&gt;“6k+ long queues wouldn’t be so bad if I knew I was getting in at the end of it,” user CodeMagick wrote. “Instead, you get a lobby error every 5-10 minutes and have no idea if your spot in queue is saved or not when you log back in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWFVAb"&gt;Others on the subreddit were annoyed by players who seemingly tried to circumvent the game’s inactive timeout feature or those who appeared to just take up space without meaningfully engaging with the game. &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; is designed to disconnect players who are inactive for 30 minutes. Creative players would try to bypass this forced logout by auto-attacking training dummies or exploiting the auto-run feature. In &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;, there’s also a popular tradition for players to gather in hub worlds and use the dance emote for hours at a time. While being a funny example of &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; culture, the action was also thought to circumvent a timeout. In one of his weekend blog posts, Yoshida reassured players that regardless of using emotes or other methods, players who are inactive even in those states after 30 minutes are booted from the server. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Syl2ooZ_QxkSBky3Q-gdT3B12TE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070996/limsalominsa.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, dancing in Limsa Lominsa will not save you from auto timeout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tLMZQo"&gt;Congestion is also affecting key in-game features. As of the time of publication, all servers with the exception of Malboro do not allow the creation of new characters, meaning all the players excited by the addition of male viera as a playable race will have to wait a little longer before they can dress them up as pretty maids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzIpnZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/4269a50a754b4f83a99b49341324153ef4405c13"&gt;In his address to fans&lt;/a&gt;, Yoshida expressed remorse that the queues are what they are and that the best solution to this problem — the addition of new servers — would be long in coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fdtaE"&gt;“On the one hand, following the explosive rise in players coming to &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; beginning in spring 2021, we spent over half a year scrambling to address the need to add new [servers],” Yoshida said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6kZYc"&gt;“However, due to policies surrounding COVID-19, which have had an effect on the entire world, even now we have been unable to procure the required hardware for adding new [servers] ... Given the current situation, we anticipate that it may take several months or more to add new [servers].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDmiCK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; launched today for the PlayStation and PC. If you log in now, the queues are pretty light.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Power companies commit to building nationwide EV charging network </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Orange County Register Archive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aaqfaqoUCzojqXc-1APVrLHXrXQ=/0x19:4062x2727/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241319/1034907296.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;City leaders and representatives from NRG eVgo unveil three new electric vehicle charging stations at the public parking structure in Hermosa Beach, CA on Friday, September 05, 2014. | Photo by Scott Varley/Digital First Media/Torrance Daily Breeze via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O1UZ02"&gt;Over 50 utilities across the US have come together to speed up the build-out of electric vehicle charging stations along the nation’s highways. The new National Electric Highway Coalition was announced today by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), an association of investor-owned power companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qc2JVT"&gt;Together, the companies aim to “fill charging infrastructure gaps along major travel corridors,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/Documents/EV_NEHC_Fact_Sheet.pdf"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;. Each utility that’s a member of the coalition must commit “in good faith” to create an EV fast charging network across its service territory “using any approach they see fit” by the end of 2023. The US will need more than 100,000 fast charging ports for the 22 million electric vehicles expected to traverse American roadways by 2030, according to the EEI.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bO1XaC"&gt;For now, the roughly &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/"&gt;1.8 million electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; registered in the US can juice up at just &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC&amp;amp;country=US"&gt;46,000 public charging stations&lt;/a&gt; in the country. Just around 5,600 of those, according to the Department of Energy, are DC fast charging stations that can get an EV battery to 80 percent charged in under an under hour. Easier access to faster charging stations, in particular, could help drive greater EV adoption among &lt;a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/spons/from-range-anxiety-to-charger-anxiety-evolving-challenges-for-ev-adoption/588063/"&gt;wary customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jsJH0X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Things are on track to change quickly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ5wBn"&gt;Things are on track to change quickly, however, because of new policies set in motion by the Biden administration. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Biden signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/08/05/executive-order-on-strengthening-american-leadership-in-clean-cars-and-trucks/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; setting a goal for half of all new passenger vehicles sold in the US by 2030 be electric or hybrid cars.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;To meet rising needs for EV charging, the recently passed &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/#electricvehicle"&gt;bipartisan infrastructure law&lt;/a&gt; includes $7.5 billion to invest in a national network of EV chargers. That could benefit utilities that choose to partner with states on putting those dollars to work, according to Kellen Schefter, director of electric transportation at EEI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZPvfi"&gt;“We’re excited about the additional funding that will be coming from the federal government to support public charging, we think all of that is needed and more,” Schefter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVGYL0"&gt;On top of permitting delays, the process of connecting new charging stations to the grid has &lt;a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/ev-charger-installations-in-california-are-bogged-down-by-local-permitting"&gt;slowed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/27/evgo-is-behind-on-charger-installations-for-gm-grounds-for-agreement-termination/"&gt;down&lt;/a&gt; the rollout of EV charging infrastructure in the past. But utilities have the advantage of already knowing what the grid’s existing capacity is at any potential new location for a charging station. That intel could help the coalition smooth out some of the road blocks that other initiatives have faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKZE0g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The vice president should not be using Bluetooth headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vice President Kamala Harris Delivers Remarks At Maternal Health Day of Action Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ynFWBmHzffJhr5oUl6p0SSF49w=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241293/1237073492.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhHXHk"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; opened its newsletter with an article on Vice President Kamala Harris’ &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2021/12/06/kamala-harris-is-bluetooth-phobic-495343"&gt;aversion to using Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. The VP was “Bluetooth-phobic,” the story claimed, “wary” of her AirPods and cautious with her technology use to an extent former aides described as “a bit paranoid.” Proof could be seen in her televised appearances: wires dangling from her ears in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K00Zx8apeg"&gt;an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid&lt;/a&gt; or clutched in her hand &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1325126733482385409"&gt;during the famous “We did it, Joe” call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjqI9Y"&gt;But for a high-profile public official, this is a lot more reasonable than you might think. As security researchers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1468044270099742723"&gt;were quick to point out&lt;/a&gt;, Bluetooth has a number of well-documented vulnerabilities that could be exploited if a bad actor wanted to hack, say, the second most powerful person in the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5aG27"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CVE Program lists 459 current and historic vulnerabilities involving Bluetooth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T50pSW"&gt;Some of these attacks come down to the basic mechanics of how the Bluetooth protocol works. With Bluetooth switched on, a phone, laptop or other smart device is constantly broadcasting a signal that can be detected by other devices in range — which provides an unnecessary vector for attack that can easily be eliminated by simply keeping Bluetooth off. Assuming Bluetooth is enabled, a smartphone user generally gets a prompt from any unknown device trying to connect. But in certain cases this can be skirted, as with one exploit that &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-devices-vulnerable-short-range-bluetooth-exploit"&gt;impersonates a trusted Bluetooth device&lt;/a&gt; already known to the user in order to connect to the phone, at which point the attacker can request or send data via Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89rDim"&gt;(The complexity of this attack makes it unlikely to affect regular people, but for a figure like the VP — who is undeniably a high-value target for foreign surveillance attempts — there’s a non-zero chance of falling victim. It also affects both Android and Apple devices, the latter of which Harris appears to use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1WTrC"&gt;Other less severe Bluetooth attacks would let an attacker crash devices through denial of service, essentially overwhelming a phone with connection requests until the processor is unable to respond. Again, such attacks have previously affected both Android &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/18/apples_bluetooth_flaws/"&gt;and Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;, although iPhones are considered to have a more secure implementation of Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAkehy"&gt;In total, the CVE Program, which tracks cybersecurity vulnerabilities, lists &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=bluetooth"&gt;459 current and historic vulnerabilities that mention Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Kamala Harris is right to be wary. There’s a simple way to mitigate all of these attacks — disabling Bluetooth, sticking to wired headphones — but doing so means swimming against the technological current, and maybe looking like you can’t afford AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SBsWo"&gt;Still, Harris’ justified distaste for Bluetooth is a win for anyone who’s been met with skepticism for suggesting that hey, perhaps they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to carry around a ball of tangled headphone wires instead of connecting wirelessly via a &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/history-bluetooth-explained-846345/"&gt;decades-old protocol&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone should be shunning the latest technology in favor of the secure option, it’s the vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
