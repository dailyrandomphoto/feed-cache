    <title>Facebook ordered to pay $4.7M to Italian developer over copycat feature </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M8UyN3"&gt;Facebook has been ordered to pay €3.83 million (around $4.72 million) in damages to an Italian developer over the social network’s “Nearby” feature. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-facebook-court-idUSKBN29A1YW?taid=5ff4e4fa5b2aa00001d6a018&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Milan-based appeals court upheld a 2019 ruling saying Facebook had copied the feature from developer Business Competence’s Faround app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNbqXG"&gt;The case dates back to 2012. That year, Business Competence launched Faround which was designed to help users find Facebook friends near their location. The app quickly gained ground in the Italian market, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-italy-idUSKBN16D2AI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. However, just months later, Facebook launched its own Nearby feature, which also competed with the likes of Foursquare and Yelp, and downloads of Faround reportedly plummeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YVcMCM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original complaint was filed in 2013&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIYflg"&gt;The Italian software developer responded by filing a lawsuit in 2013, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-italy-idUSKBN16D2AI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the court issued a preliminary ruling in its favor in 2016, which was made public in 2017. Facebook agreed to discontinue the feature in Italy while it appealed the ruling, but subsequent courts have sided with Business Competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D641rN"&gt;Responding to the decision, a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the company had “received the court’s decision” and is “examining it carefully.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge history and tab sync features finally start rolling out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KcrqrceDqYr2gGDLWy_22y1Ogw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626711/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pW4tVu"&gt;Microsoft is finally starting to roll out history and tab sync for its Edge browser. After nearly a year since its initial release, some Microsoft Edge users now see the full web history and tab sync features available in their browsers. The roll out is gradual, but you can check to see if it’s available in your country by navigating to settings &amp;gt; profiles &amp;gt; sync and enabling “history” and “open tabs” in the options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E98nQw"&gt;Not every country has access to the additional sync features just yet, but we understand the UK is one of the first markets that will see history and tab sync initially. These new features will let Edge users sync all web pages they’ve visited to additional Windows 10 or macOS devices, or even to the mobile versions of Edge for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/va_8QLd2392l97B3QEX_3Qr010U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217119/y6GLYpJ.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OGOYA5"&gt;You will need to head into the settings section on all devices you use Edge with to manually enable the history and open tabs features, though. This includes the mobile versions, where you’ll have to toggle open tabs and history, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp2uov"&gt;Microsoft initially launched Edge on January 15th, 2020 without many important sync options enabled. Extensions sync arrived in May, and Microsoft originally promised history and tab sync would start rolling out in the summer. The web history and tab sync eventually started rolling out to &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/improvements-to-history-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/1896552"&gt;beta and dev channels&lt;/a&gt; of the browser in late November, and are now appearing in the stable channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXtvWQ"&gt;Microsoft continues to improve Edge on a regular basis, recently adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507374/microsoft-edge-price-comparisons-screenshot-tool-features"&gt;really useful screenshot tool&lt;/a&gt; and a price comparisons feature. Edge will also soon be updated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199819/microsoft-edge-vertical-tabs-feature-chromium"&gt;vertical tabs&lt;/a&gt; and new &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/use-password-monitor-to-help-protect-your-passwords-online/m-p/1487025"&gt;password breach&lt;/a&gt; notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly developing radar-equipped sleep apnea tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09iOEfgiStTH11yFcxQaNrDzNbU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626667/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4I6JgE"&gt;Amazon is developing a new Alexa-powered device that can track and monitor for signs of sleep apnea using radar, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-plans-a-new-sleep-apnea-device-powered-by-alexa-2021-1?international=true&amp;amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The palm-sized device is reportedly designed to sit on a bedside table and use millimeter-wave radar to sense your breathing, keeping an eye out for interruptions associated with the apnea sleeping disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki5cPx"&gt;The idea of using radar to monitor sleep &lt;a href="https://www.idigitalhealth.com/news/radar-monitors-sleep-accuracy-comparable-current-standards/"&gt;isn’t new&lt;/a&gt;, and at least one other high profile company has attempted to commercialize the technology. Way back in 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/29/7130229/nintendo-qol-sleep-tracking-device"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt; a “non-wearable” device that could track sleep via radio waves. However, less than two years later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10920582/nintendo-sleep-tracker-qol-possibly-canceled"&gt;Nintendo said&lt;/a&gt; it wasn’t confident the device could become a viable product, and it was never released. Last month we also saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22189219/oneplus-8t-concept-color-changing-back-motion-sensing-radar"&gt;OnePlus announce a new concept phone&lt;/a&gt; that used mmWave radar to monitor breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8OVjLj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developed under the code name “Brahms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hyjLUx"&gt;Amazon’s project is apparently being developed under the code name “Brahms” after the German composer of &lt;em&gt;Lullaby&lt;/em&gt;, and is the work of an internal Amazon team built up over the past year. In its current form, the device reportedly resembles a “standing hexagonal pad connected to a metal wire base,” &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; notes. Along with sleep apnea, Amazon reportedly plans to use its machine-learning and cloud technology to understand other sleeping disorders beyond sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7Hmrs"&gt;Amazon declined to comment on the existence of the project to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;, and a spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKlyBZ"&gt;If accurate, Brahms represents Amazon’s latest push into health tech. Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174145/amazon-halo-fitness-tracker-voice-buy"&gt;released its Halo fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt;, a $99.99 wearable device that scans the wearer’s body and voice and is designed to help you improve your health. Amazon stresses that Halo is “not a medical device.” The company has also launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571091/amazon-pharmacy-store-launch-home-delivery-prescription-medication"&gt;Pharmacy service&lt;/a&gt; for delivering prescription medication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yiRZ3"&gt;At this point it’s almost easier to list objects that Amazon hasn’t tried to build its voice assistant into. Over the past few years Alexa has appeared in everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt; (obviously) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884044/amazon-echo-loop-smart-ring-hands-on-photos-alexa"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882140/amazon-basics-microwave-alexa-2018-smart-features-price-release-date"&gt;microwaves&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, we might be able to add a sleep-tracker to that list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s newest cordless vac automatically empties itself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Otaqg60OcKhDy_N7C9G5E_ZG0bM=/0x257:1805x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626532/2021_LG_CordZero_and_Charging_Station_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging stand can also store its accessories.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvHXMq"&gt;LG’s new vacuum cleaner, the ridiculously named &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/01/newest-lg-cordzerothinq-vac-with-new-charging-station-delivers-hassle-free-cleaning-experience/"&gt;LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus&lt;/a&gt;, should be a little easier to empty than most cordless vacuums. Its charging station is equipped with a “fully-automated dust removal system,” which sucks the contents of the vac’s dustbin into a dust bag as the device charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6tBYB"&gt;We’ve seen similar auto-emptying features in robot vacuum cleaners like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/6/17817220/irobot-roomba-i7-robot-vacuum-empties-itself-maps-house"&gt;iRobot Roomba i7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; before, but LG’s solution is more unique in the world of cordless stick vacuums. Samsung sells a &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/au/home-appliance-accessories/clean-station-white-vca-sae90b-sa/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Clean Station&lt;/a&gt; to work with its upright vacuum cleaner, but using it involves first detaching the vacuum’s dustbin, rather than it happening automatically during charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YNq3Fn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honey, did you charge the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxQgIe"&gt;As someone who frequently has to reach up into the dustbin of his Dyson V10 vacuum to get all the crud out, I can see the appeal of automating the process. But for bigger jobs, like vacuuming a whole house or apartment, you’re probably going to have to empty the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus mid-clean rather than waiting to automatically empty it when it charges. Hopefully the charging station’s dust bags are big enough (and cheap enough) that it doesn’t need to be emptied too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMJvzH"&gt;As well as emptying its dustbin, LG says the touchscreen-equipped charging stand can also house the vacuum’s six accessories and nozzles, like existing stick vacuum chargers from Dyson and Xiaomi. LG’s attachments include a 2-in-1 combination tool, a crevice tool, a pet nozzle, a power carpet nozzle, and a power mop. Included with the vacuum are two battery packs and removable washable filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M83G0M"&gt;LG’s press release doesn’t say how much all of this is going to cost or when it’ll be available. However, it promises the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus will be on display at its virtual booth at this year’s virtual CES, so stay virtually tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google confirms plans for new Nest Cam lineup this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rV0wepCu7uN9aQWUZ1pXdlAGQ2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626373/vpavic_180605_2644_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VWS1VN"&gt;The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is no longer available to buy, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/05/new-google-nest-cam/"&gt;Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, after the site &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/05/nest-cam-iq-outdoor-stock/"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the camera was out of stock in most countries around the world. The company says, however, that “Nest will keep investing in new innovations” including a “new lineup of security cameras for 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZKjsF"&gt;For now, Google still sells the $129 &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_specs?hl=en-US"&gt;Nest Cam Indoor&lt;/a&gt;, the $299 &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_iq_specs?hl=en-US"&gt;Next Cam IQ Indoor&lt;/a&gt;, and the $199 &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_outdoor?hl=en-US"&gt;Nest Cam Outdoor&lt;/a&gt;. The IQ models have upgraded video quality and AI-based features like face and pet recognition. Google says it will continue to support its existing Nest cameras with new features and security updates. None of the current hardware is newer than 2017, though, so an upgrade is probably overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fBQvaN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best indoor home security camera you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/8/17431074/best-home-security-camera-amazon-nest-price-features-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C4T4B1"&gt;Google didn’t provide any details on what the new Nest Cam lineup will actually include, nor when it will arrive, but it’s not necessarily surprising to see the company get ahead of the announcement. The Pixel 4A 5G and Pixel 5 were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; months ahead of their actual shipping date, while Google tweeted out an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663172/google-pixel-4-camera-sensor-design-official-photo"&gt;early picture&lt;/a&gt; of the Pixel 4 the year before in an attempt to pre-empt inevitable leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60Yvlr"&gt;Google also appears to be working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213539/google-nest-hub-update-fcc-filing-soli-motion-sense-gestures"&gt;new Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; with Soli radar gesture support, as indicated by a recent FCC filing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ExamSoft’s proctoring software has a face-detection problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Distance learning at the time of coronavirus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RaeExTB2DaA35oqZ4oBkyMzpTE=/0x0:3295x2197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68625599/1289175672.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: Cristiano Minichiello/AGF/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RvsrUa"&gt;Gabe Teninbaum, a professor at Suffolk University Law School, is calling on ExamSoft to fix a serious bug with its test-taking software: failure to recognize faces. It’s a problem that can delay test takers — or bar them from starting their exams altogether — and per reports, it disproportionately impacts people with dark skin tones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SeHOw"&gt;ExamSoft’s software records students while they complete remote exams and monitors for signs of academic dishonesty. &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=700081022092073114122122074086103089010076064020040013104092094123090083126113106025026057038062020002124108070084113123127122006010088060018030080006030068088069072040022094102026102116027021091116083106118019098029105028121030081105087087099117098&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;Teninbaum’s report&lt;/a&gt; addresses an ExamSoft feature called ExamID, which aims to verify that test-takers are who they say they are. The first time a student logs into their exam portal, they upload a photo of themselves (their “baseline image”); they’re then prompted to take another selfie before beginning future exams, which the software checks against their original photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTCm5U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-algorithms-struggle-recognize-black-faces-equally/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17615634/amazon-rekognition-aclu-mug-shot-congress-facial-recognition"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that facial-recognition algorithms consistently make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do white ones. And while those studies didn’t focus on ExamSoft specifically, it doesn’t appear to be an exception. Back in September, multiple non-white exam-takers told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the software couldn’t identify them due to “poor lighting” — a problem that Teninbaum, who has light skin, wasn’t able to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExamSoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ExamSoft&lt;/a&gt;  I FINALLY figured out ON MY OWN 4 hours later ( still on hold for an EXAM SOFT chat rep) HOW TO GET TO MY MOCK EXAM... ONLY TO BE TOLD THE SYSTEM CANT RECOGNIZE ME. I AM IN A BOARD ROOM WITH ALL OF THE LIGHTS TURNED ON AND THE SUN WAS STILL UP. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7K3yKT1y4n"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7K3yKT1y4n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Futureesq1990 (@futureesq1990) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/futureesq1990/status/1306393725099278336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjlQwj"&gt;Early this fall, Teninbaum set out to find a fix. He believes such errors add undue stress to an already stressful time period. “These are students who are about to take a high-stakes exam with a lot on the line, and that is very unwelcome,” Teninbaum said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4amm7Z"&gt;“Any time you go into an exam you just want to focus on the exam,” he added. “You don’t want to feel like you have these added challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYgJvT"&gt;Teninbaum also believes that optics matter; schools owe it to marginalized students not to rely on a category of software that’s known to be discriminatory. “Students deserve to feel that their institution is doing what it can to protect their rights, interests, and dignity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJonjk"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=700081022092073114122122074086103089010076064020040013104092094123090083126113106025026057038062020002124108070084113123127122006010088060018030080006030068088069072040022094102026102116027021091116083106118019098029105028121030081105087087099117098&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, which is forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Law&lt;/em&gt;, Teninbaum outlines the workaround he found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V41vtS"&gt;He suggests that schools assign every student an identical generic, baseline image. Then, he proposes, they should ask ExamSoft to enable “deferred identification,” a feature built into the software that allows students to proceed with exams even if identification fails. This feature is basically hidden — it’s not mentioned anywhere on ExamSoft’s website (at least, not that I could find). Only ExamSoft can turn it on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkDTq4"&gt;In tandem, these tweaks will cause ExamSoft to misidentify every test-taker. But they’ll still be able to proceed with their exams — ExamSoft will send the selfies to the school afterwards, and instructors can manually verify everyone. “We know who our students are,” Teninbaum says. “We can make sure the students are who they say they are and avoid subjecting students to these sorts of challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upekb2"&gt;He also suggests that ExamSoft make the “deferred identification” feature accessible to customers. “The reporter urges ExamSoft to build this into a feature by which institutions can simply toggle on/off, thereby bypassing ExamID until such time that the technology matures into one that does not discriminate,” his report reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63D7Sm"&gt;Teninbaum hopes those changes will last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and can help students feel more comfortable taking remote classes. “It’s going to be a growing problem as people get more and more online for their education,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKFrR3"&gt;Even so, he’s only fixed part of the problem. Students have experienced a &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/2020/09/23/cheating-frozen-computers-typing-lags-bar-examinees-raise-red-flags-over-looming-online-test/?slreturn=20210005190302"&gt;range of hiccups&lt;/a&gt; with ExamSoft’s proctoring software. &lt;a href="https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/thousands-of-california-bar-exam-takers-have-video-files-flagged-for-review"&gt;Over 3,000&lt;/a&gt; people who used the platform to take California’s bar exam in October had their videos flagged for potential rule violations — nearly 36 percent of applicants who took the online exam. Users reported audio issues, and other technical glitches as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFGP0s"&gt;A group of six US senators — including Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Corey Booker — wrote an open letter to&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.12.3%20Letter%20to%20Ed%20Testing%20Software%20Companies%20ExamSoft.pdf"&gt; ExamSoft &lt;/a&gt;in December, highlighting potential harms to students of color and students with disabilities, among numerous other concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXnhCA"&gt;ExamSoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v4GUL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxsk1X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned your Apple Watch can double as a vlogging viewfinder </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJ2R2SUUeFS4mE0jZx5JI8_l2w0=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68625472/20210105_mitchell_clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UgD7vJ"&gt;The Apple Watch’s ability to act as a camera remote for your phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125873/apple-watch-smartwatch-announced"&gt;got a mention in its announcement keynote&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s been around a while, but I’ve only ever used it once or twice to take group pictures. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSciretta/status/1346526439068160002?s=20"&gt;Twitter user @PeterSciretta&lt;/a&gt;, however, has pointed out that you can also use it as a vlogging aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6TueN"&gt;Doing this is simple: On your watch, go to the Camera Remote app. This will open the camera app on your iPhone, and you can switch it to video mode, set it up, and record. You don’t even have to strap your watch to your phone like he does in the tweet; the remote camera will totally work while your watch is on your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B1HhEr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the best self-recording hack ever and even works with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiLMiCPro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FiLMiCPro&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSciretta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PeterSciretta&lt;/a&gt; for this tip.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/LGKS3S2pCh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LGKS3S2pCh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Roy   ☕️     (@pulpjedi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pulpjedi/status/1346523889736695808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C3hAgW"&gt;I’ve shot videos on my phone before, and it was often an exercise in frustration trying to get the framing right. There was a lot of running back and forth, recording short clips to make sure the focus and framing were correct. I could’ve definitely saved myself the hassle if I had remembered that my watch could do this, though I guess I would’ve gotten fewer steps in. It’s a sacrifice I’ll just have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1VTzHl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Using your Apple Watch as an iPhone viewfinder: surprisingly latency-free and useful &lt;a href="https://t.co/PyoxK6TxND"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PyoxK6TxND&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1346618135604908032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p3jPJX"&gt;Android users don’t need to feel left out either, as Wear OS devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18014640/google-pixel-wear-os-smartwatch-camera-viewfinder"&gt;can also act as a camera viewfinder&lt;/a&gt; when connected to Pixel phones. The Apple Watch trick will also work with the popular video camera app FiLMiC Pro, as Jeff mentions in his tweet. That way, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7925023/sundance-film-festival-2015-tangerine-iphone-5s"&gt;all the benefits the third-party app offers&lt;/a&gt;, plus the remote viewing on your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sAwSS"&gt;Of course, if you’re setting out to create a new vlogging setup, this is probably not the best way to go, especially if you don’t already have an Apple Watch. For less than the price of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/3/11/18259791/apple-watch-series-3-lte-best-buy-price-sale"&gt;Apple’s least expensive Watch (the Series 3)&lt;/a&gt;, you could instead get Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F1%2F5%2F22216064%2Fiphone-vlogging-video-apple-watch-viewfinder#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lightning to HDMI adapter&lt;/a&gt; (which would also let you power your phone so it doesn’t run out of battery), and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-1280x800-Mirrorless-Panasonic-Included/dp/B077FTPT46/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=camera+monitor&amp;amp;qid=1609895598&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;tag=duckduckgo-osx-b-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small camera monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Or, you could just position your phone in front of a mirror. But if you already have an Apple Watch, and want to film yourself using your iPhone, this tip may just make that easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump signs executive order blocking transactions with Alipay, WeChat Pay, and six other Chinese apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Holds Campaign Rally For GOP Senate Candidates Ahead Of Runoff Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5l3TkH9Umqc1QhVOSefuDryHwQ=/0x2:6155x4105/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624952/1294541016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DAhOLy"&gt;President Trump has signed &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-applications-software-developed-controlled-chinese-companies/"&gt;a new executive order&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting transactions with the companies behind eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group’s Alipay and Tencent’s QQ and WeChat Pay. Transactions will be prohibited in 45 days. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; was the first &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tech-exclusive/exclusive-trump-signs-order-banning-transactions-with-eight-chinese-apps-including-alipay-idINKBN29A2PA"&gt;to report the news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJfG7p"&gt;The full list of apps includes: Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay, and WPS Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRh5Ed"&gt;“The pace and pervasiveness of the spread in the United States of certain connected mobile and desktop applications and other software developed or controlled by persons in the People’s Republic of China... continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-applications-software-developed-controlled-chinese-companies/"&gt;the order reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXmhn3"&gt;US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/01/statement-us-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-president-trumps-executive"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the Commerce Department will  “begin implementing the E.O.’s directives, including identifying prohibited transactions.” &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports that the Commerce Department will do so before Trump leaves office on January 20th, citing an unnamed official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHu6Vr"&gt;The new orders follow two earlier ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21358093/trump-tik-tok-ban-bytedance-transactions-executive-order"&gt;from August&lt;/a&gt; that already tried to ban transactions with ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, and WeChat. However, a judge blocked the WeChat ban&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447540/judge-blocks-ban-wechat-tiktok-trump"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; and again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21531154/judge-denies-trump-administration-ban-wechat-tencent-china"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, while a judge granted a preliminary injunction stopping the TikTok ban &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrfiPL"&gt;If the US is successful in banning these apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358252/tencent-wechat-ban-trump-executive-order-consequences"&gt;it could be a pretty big deal&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/21496967/trump-wechat-us-ban-tik-tok"&gt;for Chinese American families&lt;/a&gt; who use these apps to communicate online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z85ixn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 5th, 7:29PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added quote from the order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read these stories about the use of spy satellite images in environmental studies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A black and white satellite photo of an area in Russia, with text that says “18 August 1960 Imagery.” There are arrows pointing to areas that say “Parking Apron” and “Runway.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xR4BVoETmVx0OM6j4vh5fpuu5c=/0x254:755x757/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624712/corona_satellite_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo from the CIA’s Corona spy satellite program. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nro.gov/History-and-Studies/Center-for-the-Study-of-National-Reconnaissance/The-CORONA-Program/Imagery/" target="_blank"&gt;National Reconnaissance Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obfGyu"&gt;US spy satellites inadvertently collected vital environmental data at the height of the Cold War. This trove of photos and data from the Central Intelligence Agency has become crucial to the study of Earth’s environmental changes, as detailed in two fascinating stories in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; this week. One story details the life of a scientist who analyzed them for years, another follows the history of the spy satellites that provided them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BA8BB"&gt;Linda Zall, an environmental engineer, worked at the CIA for decades, leading a team that analyzed images from spy satellites to gather data for environmental studies. She wrote classified reports about how reconnaissance imagery could be used for earth and environmental science, running a &lt;a href="https://tos.org/oceanography/article/the-medea-program-opening-a-window-into-new-earth-science-data"&gt;research task force&lt;/a&gt; that she named Medea, and traveling to Moscow to negotiate the sharing of Arctic data between Russia and the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WCNuV"&gt;Though the secrecy of the CIA prevented her from being able to publicly take credit for her work, it paved the way for modern scientists to continue using the same methods to study environmental shifts. Declassified images from the Corona satellite project — which collected nearly 2 million images from orbit from 1960 to 1972 — are now used by scientists to track decades of changes around the world, from the movement of glaciers to the erosion of shorelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txwkqw"&gt;Satellites operated by the CIA have provided vast amounts of environmental data from the 1960s onward that otherwise wouldn’t exist. Other satellite documentation of the Earth’s surface wasn’t collected until later in the century, and being able to look further into the past allows scientists to more accurately predict future changes. Not all of those images are easily accessible though; the majority of Corona’s film has yet to be scanned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYIvJl"&gt;To read the full stories, both of which include comparisons of satellite imagery throughout the years, find the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/science/linda-zall-cia.html"&gt;article on Zall here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/science/corona-satellites-environment.html"&gt;history of the Corona satellites here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why Anker’s MagSafe-style charger has a gigantic USB-C plug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0-jrA5RiTLAxqlZDt3nWpPF0Bk=/0x0:1850x1233/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624545/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_3.29.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rgoFru"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe charging system&lt;/a&gt; offers a whole new way to charge iPhones, and third-party companies like Anker are jumping at the chance to make their own magnetic chargers — both official ones that work with Apple’s system and unofficial ones that just take advantage of the magnetic setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw8u4s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Anker-PowerWave/dp/B08LPPD3NL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s $22 charger&lt;/a&gt; falls into the second category: it’s not an official MagSafe charger, meaning it doesn’t offer the faster 15W charging speed or the fancy NFC tricks as “official” MagSafe products. But even with that 7.5W charging limit, Anker’s charger does &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; a lot like Apple’s, at least at first glance. Look closer at the other end of the plug, though, and there’s an obvious difference: the Anker model has a weirdly oversized USB-C plug. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eoVsUSjuo3UYaRxwdk8v9zGejxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216019/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_4.48.57_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oNTW43"&gt;That’s because the Anker charger is effectively just a regular Qi charger in a different shape, one that moves the wiring and chips to the plug in order to slim down on the actual charging pad. The design also helps reduce heat, according to the company. It may look strange, but if you think of it less as a charging cable and more as a miniaturized Qi charger, it’s actually quite impressive to see what Anker has pulled off here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5irF4i"&gt;The new charger is also just the first effort from Anker. The company says that stock will be limited, but it’s already working on upgraded magnetic charger models that should be out in about a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALND1T"&gt;On the one hand, the Anker charger is a clear indication of the limits of Apple’s MagSafe program. Third-party companies that aren’t able to create official products have to find creative workarounds, like Anker’s gigantic plug. On the other hand, Anker’s charger is a first-generation product, so these alternatives will likely get better over time. And at $22 — roughly half of what Apple charges for an official MagSafe charger, the slower charging speed might be a worthwhile trade-off for the lower price, especially as the designs continue to get more and more refined. &lt;/p&gt;
