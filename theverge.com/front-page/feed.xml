    <title>Reminder: your Neopets are dying</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GDJ7i8dhyar05j8rlLIDuZI0QgI=/185x0:1015x553/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470891/Neopets_Merch.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Neopets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ETofBz"&gt;You know good and well what you did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXEl3g"&gt;Back in 2003 or whatever, you took young, innocent Neopets under your wing. A Gelert, a Jetsam, a Scorchio, or whatever the hell the penguin one was called. You promised that under your tutelage, they would thrive. You promised you would feed them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73vZOK"&gt;And yet you didn’t feed them, did you? Your Neopoints piled up and you spent them on plushies, faerie quests, paintbrushes, and you watched your pets deteriorate right before your eyes. Their pictures saddened; tears appeared in their eyes. Their hunger status changed over time — “very hungry” to “famished” to “starving” to “dying.” Every time you logged onto that cursed site, even if just to hammer out a few levels of &lt;em&gt;Typing Terror&lt;/em&gt;, you were emphatically reminded that your beloved pets were on the brink of death.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cjx7VMAXyAW_5ev5RRfWeA_VKDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150640/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_10.48.26_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hot Topic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SWChBk"&gt;This practice, of course, begs a number of philosophical questions. Does it give Neopets users a purpose in life, something to strive for in the Neo-world? Probably. Does it help prepare kids for adulthood, where they’ll someday have to face their own mortality? It’s possible. Does it warn people not to put themselves in charge of living things that they can’t care for? Undoubtedly. Is it &lt;em&gt;ethical &lt;/em&gt;to plague children with guilt over the wellbeing of an entity that is — to be clear — entirely not real, fictional, and made-up? Well, who’s to say? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBEEiH"&gt;Hot Topic is, apparently. The store is selling a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hottopic.com%2Fproduct%2Fneopets-sad-shoyru-t-shirt%2F14953163.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158653%2Fneopets-hot-topic-shirt-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new T-shirt&lt;/a&gt; that’s clearly meant to remind us all just how careless we’ve been. It’s one of a number of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hottopic.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dneopets%26cm_mmc%3DSOC-_-EXT-_-ORG-_-DMY-_-POD-_-NEOPETS&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158653%2Fneopets-hot-topic-shirt-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Neopets-themed shirts&lt;/a&gt; that the store is selling. This one is emblazoned with the slogan “Your Neopets are dying,” as well as a picture of the most depressed-looking Neopet I’ve ever seen. The shirt costs between $22.90 and $26.90 depending on your size, but there’s a 30 percent off sale if you order one today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L64I6R"&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’m going to go ahead and order this, and wear it in every public place I can find. We early-20s denizens have screwed the pooch when it comes to our own Neopets — but maybe we can redeem ourselves if we ensure that future generations never make our mistakes. Leisure time? Recreation? No such thing in the capitalist productivity machine that is &lt;a href="http://Neopets.com"&gt;Neopets.com&lt;/a&gt;. Your Neopets are dying, children. Feed them. &lt;em&gt;Feed them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy’s video game sale is an easy way to build your new PS5 or Xbox Series X library</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrFL9NGZY7SzZhAGXag23aYrBGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470830/vpavic_4261_20201026_0181.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PdUZe2"&gt;Gaming is an expensive hobby, especially if you recently purchased a new console. If you are looking to buy some new games but don’t want to burn a major hole in your pocket, Best Buy’s current promotion focuses on next-gen games: if you &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725883399713243224" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two eligible next-gen titles, you get a third title free of charge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zoaz7R"&gt;This is an ideal way to add three new games to your collection. The games’ pricing varies anywhere between $10 to $100. Many of these games are last-gen titles and include free next-gen upgrades, so they can work with both older consoles and the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd0J2e"&gt;Some highlights in this deal include &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881560814179116" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881612897257275" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881683012320033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being released on December 10th. If you own a Nintendo Switch, the retailer is also offering a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725883737997928539" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy one, get a second title for 50 percent off&lt;/a&gt; deal on select titles available on Nintendo’s hybrid console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uPFmtM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvoPhB"&gt;With the holiday season just around the corner, this is not a bad option if you already have in mind which titles you want to play on your PS5 or Xbox Series X. Both consoles are quite difficult to purchase right now, but if you already own one, Best Buy’s promotion is a great way to start building your library. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Timnit Gebru’s team at Google is going public with their side of the story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2018 - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G41JM5rdJtnisERN9tPc9Ld4GRY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470766/1028811898.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White / Getty Images for TechCrunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjBLMY"&gt;Google employees who worked with Timnit Gebru are coming out publicly to dispute claims against the star AI ethics researcher. On Monday, the team &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/"&gt;published a letter on the Google Walkout Medium account&lt;/a&gt; firmly stating that Gebru was fired and did not resign &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;as Google’s head of artificial intelligence, Jeff Dean, said&lt;/a&gt;. They also said the publication review policy that Gebru was supposed to follow was applied “unevenly and discriminatorily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlZ0wx"&gt;“Dr. Gebru’s dismissal has been framed as a resignation, but in Dr. Gebru’s own words, she did not resign,” the letter says. It notes that Gebru asked for certain conditions to be met in order for her to stay at Google, including transparency around who wanted her paper retracted. Ultimately, the leaders of the ethical AI team said they could not meet these conditions and preemptively accepted her resignation. &lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&amp;amp;id=100002932057665&amp;amp;comment_id=3470470943060607&amp;amp;notif_t=mentions_comment&amp;amp;notif_id=1607192244022022&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;Her own manager said he was “stunned.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFmTPq"&gt;The paper that got Gebru fired detailed potential risks associated with large language processing models, including over-relying on data from wealthy countries that have more internet access. “The result is that AI-generated language will be homogenized, reflecting the practices of the richest countries and communities,” &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;wrote &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQn78I"&gt;This research could have been problematic for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge"&gt;which created a large language model called BERT in 2018, which has changed how it queries search results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq7EpR"&gt;Gebru was planning to present the paper at a computer science conference in March. On October 7th, she submitted it for review internally at Google. Shortly after midnight on October 8th, it was approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNCbG1"&gt;In his statement, Dean said the research team requires two weeks for review. “Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4ZoL7"&gt;But Gebru’s team is pushing back on that assessment, saying the review policy is meant to be flexible, and most people do not follow the structure Dean laid out. The team collected data showing the vast majority of approvals happen right before the deadline, and 41 percent happen &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the deadline. “There is no hard requirement for papers to actually go through this review with two weeks notice,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYNvHP"&gt;Google managers asked Gebru to retract the paper or take her name off it, a request she said felt like censorship &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “You’re not going to have papers that make the company happy all the time and don’t point out problems,” she said. “That’s antithetical to what it means to be that kind of researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjNbB7"&gt;Gebru &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;sent an email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv at Google&lt;/a&gt; detailing the pushback she’d gotten on the paper. She also voiced exasperation with the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. “The DEI [objectives and key results] that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the ‘we need more mentorship’ rather than ‘we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing’ the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3AdqH"&gt;This frustration was shared by members of her team who felt the company’s goals to create a more diverse and equitable workplace were weak. “They’re really paltry demands,” says Alex Hanna, a senior researcher who worked under Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b2AgW"&gt;More than 1,500 employees have signed &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;a Google Walkout petition protesting Gebru’s dismissal&lt;/a&gt;. “Instead of being embraced by Google as an exceptionally talented and prolific contributor, Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing,” the petition says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNwVn4"&gt;But it’s members of her team who feel the loss most acutely. “We’re pretty deflated,” Hanna says. “When someone who is the heart and soul of your team gets fired ostensibly for doing ethics research, what can you do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXqHLK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated the letter was signed by more than 1,500 Google employees. That was the Google Walkout petition. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb launches nonprofit to provide stays for essential workers and refugees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Airbnb Illustration In Athens" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iw0KG2uT_UHU1x7x5Ec0fyh7c3g=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470695/1229089428.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcfAXt"&gt;Airbnb is launching a nonprofit to allow the hosts who rent out their properties on its platform to provide free and discounted stays to refugees, people affected by natural disasters, and frontline workers in the coronavirus pandemic. The new organization, called &lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.org/"&gt;Airbnb.org&lt;/a&gt;, is the evolution of Airbnb’s Open Homes and Frontline stays programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g47jJM"&gt;Open Homes started in 2012, inspired by a host who opened her home to people affected by Hurricane Sandy. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195307/airbnb-free-first-responders-hosts-coronavirus-rentals"&gt;introduced the Frontline stays program&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, as a way to provide first responders a place to stay — either to be closer to work or to quarantine away from their families while treating COVID-19 patients. The company says more than 100,000 hosts worldwide have provided accommodations under the programs. Now, both programs will be called Airbnb.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6YpGj"&gt;The company says Airbnb hosts who offer free stays or make recurring donations to Airbnb.org will get a special badge on their profiles “to recognize their generosity and commitment to communities in need.” Asked whether Airbnb would reimburse hosts for participating in the program, a company spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “hosts can choose whether they can provide a free or discounted stay and those are considered in-kind donations” to Airbnb.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjOGcG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/07/tech/airbnb-hosts-coronavirus/index.html"&gt;Airbnb hosts have struggled&lt;/a&gt; to book properties during the pandemic, and the company announced in March it would &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-airbnb-hosts-angry-at-refunds.html"&gt;offer refunds to guests&lt;/a&gt; who canceled reservations. The company didn’t offer reimbursement to hosts under that new policy and is now &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/airbnb-hit-with-proposed-class-action-lawsuit-from-host-missing-payments.html"&gt;facing a proposed class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, brought by a Texas host who says the refund policy violated Airbnb’s contract with hosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mPJ9J"&gt;The new nonprofit will partner with relief organizations like the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE). Airbnb also says it will commit $1 million over the next two years to help cover stays for IFRC volunteers and staff “fighting the spread of COVID-19” and $1 million to CORE to support essential workers at COVID-19 testing sites and at future vaccine distribution centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IWlz"&gt;The company has committed 400,000 shares of Airbnb stock to support the new nonprofit, and company co-founders Joe Gebbia, Brian Chesky, and Nathan Blecharczyk will donate an additional $6 million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpJeZN"&gt;Airbnb is expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq exchange this week under the ticker ABNB. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-boosts-ipo-price-range-to-between-56-and-60-a-share-11607302117"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday that the company plans to price shares between $56 and $60 per share on a valuation of as much as $42 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOTVht"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLjrAM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkHgj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pbv6Q1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds Apple Music support to Assistant smart speakers and displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9oQzfYVrJNGvVSNUT53l88Uf8Q=/0x0:5248x3499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470573/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nest Audio smart speaker | Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vP0C9F"&gt;Google has announced that Apple Music is now available on smart speakers and displays that use the Google Assistant, including Google’s own line of Nest products, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;new Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;. Owners of Assistant smart speakers or displays will be able to set Apple Music as the default service on the speakers and use their voice to play songs, albums, or playlists from it, much like they can do with Spotify, Pandora, or YouTube Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2e5mu"&gt;This addition broadens the appeal of Assistant smart speakers and displays to a wider market, and it catches Google’s smart speaker line up to Amazon’s, which has supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18141112/apple-music-support-amazon-echo-speakers"&gt;Apple Music through Alexa on Echo smart speakers since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. As with the other services available on Google smart speakers, you can play Apple Music on multiple speakers at the same time for whole home audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEExNB"&gt;With Apple Music on board, the only major services left that aren’t full supported on Google’s smart speakers are Amazon Music and Tidal, both of which are compatible with Echo speakers (which don’t support Google’s YouTube Music service). Apple’s HomePod smart speakers are in a distant last place here, with support for just Apple Music and Pandora at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im2JMI"&gt;Google says that Apple Music support will begin rolling out today, December 7th, 2020, in the US, UK, France, Germany, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KCCqzO"&gt;I expected to see some once-expired Black Friday deals make their return before the holidays, and &lt;em&gt;ta-da&lt;/em&gt;, that’s what’s happening today. We’re just seeing a few comeback deals today from Best Buy and Amazon, but they’re some of the best discounts from Black Friday. The shortlist includes Eero’s multi-pack mesh Wi-Fi routers and Apple Watch models varying in price, size, and capabilities. Oh, and a little game called &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; releases this Thursday, and there are deals on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oObPBr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R6n3JL"&gt;Give your Wi-Fi a boost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rw53b8"&gt;Eero’s mesh Wi-Fi routers are a good gift, either to yourself or someone you know who has a bungled Wi-Fi situation. Both the new Eero 6 routers with Wi-Fi 6 and the last-gen model that’s cheaper are discounted, giving you options based on your budget and need for internet speed. The Eero Pro 6 lineup isn’t discounted, for now at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PiLpCg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="9sWWEY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536532"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QtdwMH"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7UhZ1n"&gt;Grab an Apple Watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wM8w3g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725880721750085691" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 3 up to the latest Series 6 and SE models are discounted at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite of the bunch is actually the Series 5, which has been tough to come by since the newer model succeeded it. You can get a 40mm Series 5 watch with GPS for $300, putting it just $40 above the $259 SE. For that price difference, you’re getting mostly the same design and hardware but with an always-on display and support for taking EKGs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pbtyu"&gt;Something else worth mentioning about Best Buy’s sale today is that if you purchase either a Series 6 or SE, you’ll get a free surf blue-colored sport band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZRYQWg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10210144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8sPrRs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EfEoZx"&gt;Save on &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; in myriad ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W9EkoT"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is releasing Thursday, December 10th. And if you haven’t yet preordered the game, there are ways to save some money ahead of its release. First off, if you have a PS4 or PS5, you can snag the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJWBYKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation version of the game for $50 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $10 off. Secondly, Best Buy is hosting a “&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881273732011577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two, get one free&lt;/a&gt;” deal on several games that give gamers complimentary next-gen upgrades. That promo loops in both the PS4 and Xbox One versions of many titles, including &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yCNlGa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10210167"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>LG developing sliding doors made of transparent OLED displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tE1GhJTj8NmyG1p97xcZN_8bRLs=/0x107:2560x1814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68469663/Transparent_OLED_Automatic_Door_03_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be able to see through the screens on the doors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NcbQEO"&gt;LG has partnered with Swedish manufacturer Assa Abloy Entrance Systems to develop automatic sliding doors with built-in transparent OLED displays, the &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2020/12/lg-and-assa-abloy-to-develop-transparent-oled-automatic-door/"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The doors will be aimed at businesses, and LG says they’ll be able to greet customers, communicate with employees, or show ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtVzzM"&gt;LG has been showing off its transparent displays for a little while now, and it unveiled a range of transparent signage &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Owze8dBuZw"&gt;early last year&lt;/a&gt;. Now, we’re seeing the panels used in the real world. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.koreatechtoday.com/lg-display-supplies-transparent-oled-screen-to-chinas-subway/#:~:text=LG%20Display%20announced%20on%20Friday,line%20No.10%20in%20Shenzhen"&gt;LG announced&lt;/a&gt; that its displays were being used in the windows of subway carriages in Beijing and Shenzhen in China, and &lt;em&gt;OLED-Info &lt;/em&gt;reports that both &lt;a href="https://www.oled-info.com/panasonic-launches-its-first-commercial-oled-tv"&gt;Panasonic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oled-info.com/xiaomi-launches-transparent-oled-tv-consumer-market"&gt;Xiaomi’s&lt;/a&gt; transparent OLED TVs use LG panels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdBoZoAjq2q3oGmwkvzDmArSygU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150274/Transparent_OLED_Automatic_Door_01_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One photo shows how the doors could be used to show ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pqEf4X"&gt;South Korea’s other major display manufacturer, Samsung, has also experimented with transparent OLED displays in the past, but &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160826000325"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 that it had ceased production of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHM6Tw"&gt;LG’s announcement doesn’t give much of an indication of when these high-end doors might become available for businesses. But considering the transparent OLED technology has started being deployed, they can’t be too far away from decorating the world’s most decadent shopping centers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea ends publication of iconic printed catalog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GS4gpa-mbyAiRkgf50fFivfGNeg=/0x21:512x362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68469623/574057_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A collection of Ikea catalogs from over the years.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMA18s"&gt;After a 70-year run, Ikea is discontinuing the publication of its printed catalog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZ4l7G"&gt;Ikea’s decision comes as catalog readership is in decline and the company becomes increasingly more digital. After initially resisting online shopping, the company was forced to embrace it during the pandemic. Ikea says its online retail sales increased by 45 percent worldwide last year with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fikea.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158345%2Fikea-kills-catalog#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ikea.com&lt;/a&gt; reporting four billion visits. The company has also improved its suite of apps to make discovering and buying products easier, while opening smaller stores located in city centers meant to reach people where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xC5QpD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More copies printed than either the Bible or the Quran&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N54TbV"&gt;At its peak in 2016, Ikea says that 200 million catalogs were distributed in 32 languages. A &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; documentary &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5331719/The-secret-making-IKEA-catalogue.html"&gt;once claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the Ikea catalog was the largest publication in the world, with more copies printed than either the Bible or the Quran. The first Ikea catalog was put together by Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad in 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w78J2M"&gt;“For 70 years [the catalog] has been one of our most unique and iconic products, which has inspired billions of people across the world.” said Konrad Grüss, Managing Director, Inter IKEA Systems BV. “Media consumption and customer behaviors have changed, and Ikea is already increasing digital investments while volumes and interest in the catalogue have decreased.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbgLEb"&gt;Ikea says it will commemorate the catalog with a book launching in the autumn of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mandalorian’s unique rifle is Nerf’s latest foam-firing Star Wars toy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBtSUYbolCZy6ABATzj_QTOdLow=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68469515/nerf_mandalorian_pulse_rifle_jpg_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NVwTCm"&gt;If you have a 12-year-old, you might want to make sure they’re not reading over your shoulder right now  — otherwise you’ll be spending some quality time explaining why they’re &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;getting a $120 toy blaster this holiday season. Oh, who am I kidding: I’m having that chat with myself right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8enysq"&gt;Yes, that’s the price of this fully functional foam-flinging replica of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152431/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-6-star-wars-dark-forces-trooper-baby-yoda-grogu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; Amban Phase-pulse blaster, which — if I’m not mistaken — is the longest Nerf blaster ever made.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmpPj3lL7xCnPZmSouaVSKwUX-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22147028/Nerf_Star_Wars_The_Mandalorian_Amban_Phase_pulse_Blaster_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click or save this one to blow it up to full resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tizTup"&gt;It’s over four feet (specifically 50.25 inches) long, features a light-up scope and “accurate sounds” (four blaster sounds, four charging sounds) after you install two AAA batteries, and it’s got lots of fake scratches and wear so it looks moderately broken in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYZHRE"&gt;Most importantly, it lets you load a standard Nerf Elite dart just like he-who-wears-the-Beskar, by cramming a fresh “cartridge” into the pop-up breach. Just push the white handle underneath the scope forward, and you’re ready to reload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8OH8tGdOkES-US0HFlA4dOmiYmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22147016/nerf_mandalorian_pulse_rifle_jpg_012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pop-up breach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rg77KbWbl_ayACJXDHXy5HsYLs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22147017/nerf_mandalorian_pulse_rifle_jpg_010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a button on the scope collar to turn the light on and off. It’ll turn off after two minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JsbCNb"&gt;As you might imagine, all those characteristics won’t necessarily make it an &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; Nerf weapon for an actual office skirmish or backyard battle: we’re talking about a single-shot, spring-powered blaster with a tremendous faux barrel (which might create drag) and a very minimal priming handle. Hasbro declined to tell me how far it’ll shoot, either, which suggests the range is probably nothing to brag about — but here’s hoping for a surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4wEBxiVPLslOCnNLCgVNZhDmxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22147023/nerf_mandalorian_pulse_rifle_jpg_014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detailing on both sides (unlike cheaper Nerf blasters), plus attachment points so you can sling it over your back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqbHwAEXWwoREHFy89NVMaGzdOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22147024/nerf_mandalorian_pulse_rifle_jpg_013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tips look pointy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3tMINw"&gt;But most of Hasbro’s recent licensed tie-ins aren’t the best at blasting; they’re simply cool toys with an added foam surprise. Nerf’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kor7ddl9MU"&gt;Halo MA40 Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Sergeant-Deluxe-Blaster/dp/B01BQ9S8JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rogue One Jyn Erso Deluxe Blaster&lt;/a&gt;, and the hard-to-find &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Episode-Stormtrooper-Blaster/dp/B00SOFZT8G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Episode VII First Order Stormtrooper Deluxe Blaster&lt;/a&gt; are rare exceptions to the rule. In fact, if you’re looking for an accurate long-range foam blaster in 2020, the one you want &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdXeLAvkqJM"&gt;doesn’t necessarily come from Nerf&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQIexd"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo2zDMNBDo1/"&gt;what the actual &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;prop looks like&lt;/a&gt;, in case you need a refresher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jGnO5M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo2zDMNBDo1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:16px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo2zDMNBDo1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" background:#FFFFFF; line-height:0; padding:0 0; text-align:center; text-decoration:none; width:100%;" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;div style=" display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; &lt;div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="OzWeh9"&gt;The new Nerf blaster will be available for pre-order today at 1PM PT / 4PM ET (links to come), but you should know it’s not slated to ship until Spring 2021.

    <title>Apple working on a 32-core processor for high-end Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UMnMr0vvSY3kC63vTqZbFdYZmo=/109x0:1276x778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68469396/Apple_new_m1_chip_11102020_big.jpg.medium_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s M1 processor (pictured) is its first processor designed for the Mac.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8QQhnj"&gt;Apple is working on a new ARM-based processor with as many as 32 high-performance CPU cores that could appear in a Mac in late 2021, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The processor could also appear in a new “half-sized Mac Pro” in 2022.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Alongside it, the company is also reportedly developing CPU designs with up to 16 high-performance cores and four power-efficient cores which are destined for new versions of the MacBook Pro and iMac. The new processors could arrive as early as spring 2021. Future Apple Silicon designs could also feature GPUs with up to 128 dedicated cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwS0KQ"&gt;News of the upcoming processors comes as Apple has just released its first Macs powered by its own chips. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; each used the company’s M1 chip, which features a CPU with four high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. However, the company’s more powerful machines like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; continue to use Intel chips. Apple has said it intends to transition its whole Mac lineup onto its own chips over the course of two years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syWrribvqSBgrHzMIcUlEitcSnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150250/chip_cpu__dg71gt6zecya_medium_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Apple’s existing M1 chip comes with 8 CPU cores; 4 high-performance cores, and 4 efficiency cores.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e20bcH"&gt;As well as the increased CPU core count, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that Apple is also working on chips with more GPU cores. While the current M1 chip comes with either seven or eight GPU cores, Apple is currently testing models with 16 and 32-cores, and is working on chips with as many as 128 for late 2021 or 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ri_D7v7DbUra2fv_EO_i4OP97Vk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150244/chip_gpu__bg7771yvjbpu_medium_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M1 chip has up to eight dedicated GPU cores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2J0hvt"&gt;Although Apple is working on a processor design with 16 high-performance CPU cores, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that it might choose to release it with only eight or 12 cores enabled, depending on how mass production goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjVGRi"&gt;Prior to Apple’s announcement of its switch to ARM-based processors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232441/apple-arm-mac-2020-5nm-processor-12-cores"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on a processor with a CPU featuring eight high-performance cores and four energy-efficient cores. A processor with this exact combination of cores is yet to be officially announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4A26V"&gt;Considering Apple’s ambitious plans to move its entire Mac lineup onto its own silicon in the next two years, it makes sense that it has more powerful chips in development. Its first ARM-based Macs have impressed thanks to their combination of power-efficiency and performance, but matching the capabilities of its more powerful Intel-based machines like the Mac Pro is likely to be a far bigger challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRIKPP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
