    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great only costs $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="R6sqE4"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier in 2021 than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. (For example, my LG OLED doesn’t have HBO Max.) So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can slow down from time to time, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its easy-to-use software, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is the best streaming device for people looking for a good, simple option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. Roku Streaming Stick Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid, which can make the experience feel a bit siloed — but there’s no beating that ease of use. And Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Despite some occasional spats with content companies, Roku now has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, including (most recently) HBO Max and Peacock. And the wonderfully neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, favoring your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over making you pay money to rent or buy. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The $50 Streaming Stick Plus remains the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It gives you HDR, Dolby Atmos, and speedy performance. The main thing you’ll miss out on is Dolby Vision. If that’s a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, you should look at the $100 Roku Ultra set-top box instead, which also includes an Ethernet port for optional wired connectivity and a helpful remote finder feature. Plus, the Ultra’s remote has customizable shortcut buttons and a headphone jack so you can listen privately to whatever’s on-screen if you’re trying to keep quiet at night. (Other Rokus let you do the latter with the company’s mobile app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) Still, the company is adding other perks to offset that weakness. Late last year, it added support for Apple’s AirPlay, letting you easily send content from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV screen. Speaking of Apple…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple TV 4K, the best streaming device user experience, on a table with the Siri remote." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RvuBLV2eYixMw2JxsRp5Rer4NJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19701522/cwelch_200205_3895_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s more pricey than the competition, but the Apple TV 4K offers a top-notch user experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;The Apple TV 4K is laughably overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything it can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351704"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;But there’s no forgiving the infamous remote, which is cumbersome to use and too easy to lose. And it’s more difficult than ever to recommend that you spend $180 on hardware that’s now several years old. Doing so isn’t &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;; you’ve just got to know why the Apple TV 4K is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K, a great streaming stick for $50, pictured attached to a TV’s HDMI port." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQ6Oml67NEpEL1BJiRk4Z7fw5Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360395/cwelch_181030_3054_0442.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K checks off all the boxes for HDR support and costs just $50, making it the best streaming stick for people in Amazon’s ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is yet another popular pick in that $50 range of streaming gadgets. The latest model added support for Dolby Vision, which made it the only product to offer everything HDR (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, HDR10) for such little money — until the new Chromecast came along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-focused approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon tends to showcase its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, but the newly revamped software goes a long way in improving the look and feel of the Fire TV. Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0rvix"&gt;Amazon offers most major streaming apps, but there are some frustrating omissions: Vudu — a good source of Dolby Vision movies — and Peacock are both still absent from the Fire TV platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It essentially doubles as a streaming device and small smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zkClUu"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEmAuOHlgj4pGSulYPpS4vSMAlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324253/DSCF4370.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Daft Punk split up after 28 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="59th GRAMMY Awards - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdGqe6fXtokwBUmEMeWS5-7oFZ4=/0x1:4100x2734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854903/634986256.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for NARAS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uokwiN"&gt;The Paris-born electronic music duo Daft Punk are no more. The group, consisting of French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, confirmed the breakup with an eight-minute video titled “Epilogue” excerpted from their 2006 science fiction film &lt;em&gt;Electroma&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/daft-punk-call-it-quits/?utm_brand=p4k&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also confirmed the news with Daft Punk’s publicist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW2SMb"&gt;Daft Punk formed in 1993 in Paris and would go on to have a monumental effect on the emerging house and techno scenes of Europe and later all of pop music around the globe, with landmark albums like 1997’s &lt;em&gt;Homework &lt;/em&gt;and 2002’s &lt;em&gt;Discovery &lt;/em&gt;and singles like “Around the World” and “One More Time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjGnFS"&gt;A standout of Daft Punk’s early career included the anime film&lt;em&gt; Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&lt;/em&gt;. It told a visualized narrative of their album &lt;em&gt;Discovery &lt;/em&gt;in partnership with legendary Japanese studio Toei Animation and manga artist Leiji Matsumoto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vwlbQA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Qxe-QOp_-s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ca07uY"&gt;The duo became increasingly elusive throughout the 2000s as they retreated behind their signature robotic helmets and made sparingly few public appearances and even fewer interviews. Though even as they paused production on follow-up albums after 2005’s &lt;em&gt;Human After All&lt;/em&gt;, Daft Punk stayed relevant through infusions of dance music into the mainstream culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmi6sl"&gt;They licensed “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” to rapper Kanye West for his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g"&gt;2007 single “Stronger,”&lt;/a&gt; and the duo put the Coachella Music Festival on the map with an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewKLSeaECAA"&gt;absurd, expensive, and unforgettable performance&lt;/a&gt; the year prior when they debuted their now-iconic pyramid. They also produced their first film score with the &lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;soundtrack in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqzFTo"&gt;In 2013, Daft Punk released &lt;em&gt;Random Access Memories&lt;/em&gt;, an album dedicated to live instrumentation and the American roots of funk and disco. It went on to win numerous Grammy Awards and cemented Daft Punk as legends of genre-blending pop music. It would be their final album. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus warns of offensive content featured in some episodes of The Muppet Show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AZBgpzdTnZs2-24Nl5QXBeMDYzY=/0x143:1200x943/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854574/TMS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yfo21g"&gt;All five seasons of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238672/muppet-show-disney-plus-seasons-streaming-movies-manhattan-space-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt; arrived on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; this past Friday. And depending on which episode you are streaming, you may receive a content disclaimer warning of potentially offensive material featured in the episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dShi88"&gt;Disney included a content warning for 18 episodes of the comedy show. The disclaimer, as pictured below, has been added to some episodes, warning viewers that the episode featured may include “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures.” Despite the controversial material some episodes contain, Disney decided to leave these episodes to “acknowledge the [offensive content’s] harmful impact, learn from it, and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4Rn82P5JpQwL0cLyGL43wjyiiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320176/the_muppets_show_disclaimer.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some episodes of The Muppet Show will display an unskippable content warning for 12 seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gmVxwW"&gt;One example of this disclaimer is in season 5, episode 14, which singer Johnny Cash hosted. In the episode, Cash sings in front of a Confederate battle flag, which, in modern times, has been associated with white nationalists and white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeK3Hr"&gt;This is not the first time Disney has issued content warnings before certain content on its service. Some older movies in Disney’s library also include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963014/disney-plus-racism-cultural-disclaimer-dumbo-song-of-the-south-warner-bros-tom-jerry"&gt;the same content warning&lt;/a&gt; for racist or insensitive stereotypes, including 1941’s &lt;em&gt;Dumbo&lt;/em&gt; and 1953’s &lt;em&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/em&gt;. Those films have also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253052/disney-racist-films-movies-dumbo-peter-pan-aristocats-jungle-book"&gt;recently removed from Disney Plus “Kids”&lt;/a&gt; profiles for viewers aged seven or younger. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Galaxy S21 Plus is already $200 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qUlteDY9nsA_H7LNxXnT66KaEB4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854494/vpavic_210122_4378_0249.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9e1B2"&gt;Samsung released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 phones&lt;/a&gt; in late January, and it isn’t taking long for its original price to plummet. The Galaxy S21 Plus with a 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED screen and 128GB of storage that originally sold for $1,000 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is now $800 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is the steepest price cut yet. Making this deal even better is the extra $100 in savings Amazon is offering on the Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds (knocking them down to $100) when you purchase them together. To take advantage of that bundle offer, highlight the orange “Extra Savings” box on the product page, then hit “Add both to cart.” Currently, the black, silver, and violet colors are available with this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lugQJs"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FRMPN/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smaller Galaxy S21 is $100 off its usual price&lt;/a&gt;, making it $700 (with the same Galaxy Buds Pro offer). We’ve seen this deal before: it’s the Galaxy S21 Plus that really sticks out in terms of the discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dKHb8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yKa4t8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt; compilation of games for the Nintendo Switch (containing &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;) will no longer be available digitally through the eShop as of March 31st, 2021. Suffice it to say, it’ll likely be tougher to find a physical copy, too — at least at retail cost. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G3MN6KP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling it for $50&lt;/a&gt; right now, which is $10 less than it usually costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PsQTCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="NwOGoL"&gt;Jabra’s Elite 85t noise-canceling, wireless earbuds &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733022996769743091" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are $50 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR78C46/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $230, they’re $180. This is Jabra’s most premium truly wireless earbud option, and they’re more different from the company’s other earbuds than they might appear. They’re built to be “semi-open” to help eliminate, as my colleague Chris Welch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;review puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “the plugged-up ear feeling of older sets.” He says these don’t have resounding bass, but they’re comfortable and noise cancellation is solid. Another big selling point is multipoint Bluetooth connections, allowing you to connect to multiple devices simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung launches EKG support for latest Galaxy Watch devices in 31 more countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JqgB59A0xwDD-a74CvLEbwmn9lA=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854417/dseifert_200811_4139_0015.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vr5afU"&gt;Samsung has launched support for electrocardiogram (EKG) readings and blood pressure monitoring on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3&lt;/a&gt; devices, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/ecg-support-for-galaxy-watch-2-galaxy-watch-3-rolling-out-to-31-markets/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The feature comes courtesy of the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is now available to download from the company’s app store in 31 additional countries. Prior to today, the features were restricted to owners of one of those two devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452541/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-ecg-electrocardiogram-update"&gt;in South Korea and the US only&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYgQdV"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251411/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-active-2-ekg-blood-pressure-health-monitor"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt; it would be adding the features to its latest Galaxy Watch devices through software updates, considering both smartwatches have the requisite sensors used for measuring heart rate and blood pressure and performing an EKG. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5IgP8dTfI_Iz4vIYnji5V5zCOPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320177/Watch3_Three_UIs_ECG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fDLB4N"&gt;Now, users in 31 more countries — mostly in Europe — should have access after Samsung was given the CE marking clearance for its Samsung Health Monitor app in the EU. That regulatory approval signals the software meets the health and safety standards required for distribution in the region. &lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;notes you’ll need the app downloaded and updated to the latest version on both a compatible Galaxy Watch and Samsung phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPFhQh"&gt;The full list of countries includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UAE, and the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Word is getting text predictions next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0xs5REMAS3-RrmuXalCAwJNYGY=/53x0:547x329/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854311/1613999094_predictions_word_win32.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pU9IlG"&gt;Microsoft is planning to add text predictions to Word in March. The new feature will work similarly to Google Docs’ Smart Compose option, using machine learning to predict what words an author will need to speed up document creation. Microsoft originally announced a beta of text predictions last year, but &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-plans-to-roll-out-support-for-text-predictions-to-word-next-month/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin &lt;/em&gt;spotted&lt;/a&gt; it’s now on the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-gb%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Froadmap%3Ffilters%3D%26searchterms%3D80179" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft 365 roadmap&lt;/a&gt; to reach all Word users on Windows next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ6C6R"&gt;Word will highlight grayed-out predictions when users are writing a document, and the suggestions can be accepted using the Tab key or rejected by hitting Escape. Text predictions can also be completely disabled by Word users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hToLj5WUJocWMeng_ylLeiSwjw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320112/1613999094_predictions_word_win32.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word text predictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4M88Em"&gt;Microsoft also started rolling out identical text predictions in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Froadmap%3Ffilters%3D%26searchterms%3D60340" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Outlook for Windows&lt;/a&gt; this month, allowing users to compose emails faster. These Gmail-like text predictions also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254298/microsoft-outlook-web-text-predictions-gmail-smart-compose-feature"&gt;rolled out to Outlook on the web&lt;/a&gt; last year, alongside a feature to let people schedule when emails would be sent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon is a huge hit because it’s cooperative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLMDkFHI3Jef9hh1NCfDTG2zxl0=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854286/akrales_160226_0960_0062_A.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years later, that’s still the case&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="H2CSpB"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; launched 25 years ago, it did so twice simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgouT2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Red &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; (later made &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;/em&gt; for its Western release) are almost identical, but each has a few exclusive monsters. The fire puppy Growlithe is only available in &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt;, for example, while those searching for a Venus flytrap-like Bellsprout will need to pick up &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt;. Players can also trade with a friend who has the opposing version. What began as a fairly cheap trick to encourage invested fans to purchase the game twice or to pressure their friends into picking it up, has since become a cornerstone of the entire &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise: it’s meant to be shared.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anProH"&gt;Alongside trading, players could also set up battles between the pokémon they caught and trained in their games. These two features transformed the otherwise single-player roleplaying games in ways that would be constantly iterated on as the core games received sequel after sequel. But even before the release of the second set, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Gold &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Silver&lt;/em&gt;, spinoffs were increasingly focusing on multiplayer aspects. For example, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Stadium&lt;/em&gt;, released just two years after &lt;em&gt;Red &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Green&lt;/em&gt;, brought battles to the forefront. It allowed players to “rent” pokémon from an in-game library, letting friends fight friends without having to first catch and train them alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ReBxdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Before long, the franchise was getting its hooks into an entire generation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNLHyO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stadium &lt;/em&gt;also added a handful of competitive mini-games. Where battling and trading required some understanding of the franchise’s core mechanics, these applied cute and easily recognizable pokémon as a decorative skin for already familiar concepts. Players might have to race Rattata through obstacle courses or play quoit with Ekans, for instance. Released in the same year as &lt;em&gt;Mario Party,&lt;/em&gt; Nintendo was beginning to marry its existing properties with something approachable and family-focused, opening them up to much wider audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYmf8w"&gt;Alongside this expansion into casual play came other forms of media, and before long, the franchise was getting its hooks into an entire generation. Kids would reenact the anime on the playground, reinforcing its themes of friendship and teamwork (and rivalry). The trading card game was necessarily communal, if in a way that got it &lt;a href="https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/article/A-Brief-History-of-Pokemon-Getting-Banned-from-Middle-Schools/c7a4cc37-0d7c-4348-a081-445493a7bf16/"&gt;banned from numerous schools&lt;/a&gt;. Spinoff games continued to cross genres, bringing in different kinds of fans, from the match-3 &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Puzzle League&lt;/em&gt; released in 2000 down to the upcoming MOBA &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. A positive feedback loop had begun. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; was meant to be shared — and, increasingly, everyone was someone you could share it with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvOCP-wyF6zWb-FJsI3MC-MLEBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8899377/ddeahl_170722_1861_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dani Deahl / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BK0i7Q"&gt;No matter how much it became a global phenomenon, selling double copies of the core games remained a habit that Nintendo refused to shake. But though this may have begun as a relatively transparent cash grab, as technology improved, it became less important to buy both games or to recruit a friend to get the opposing version. (Having said that, every friendship group that I’ve been in when a new set is announced has had careful discussions about who would get which; it’s an ingrained behavior.) By the franchise’s 10th anniversary, purely online trading was possible. &lt;em&gt;Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt; introduced the Global Trade Station, which allowed players to browse, search, and offer exchanges with strangers from across the world. They could also take part in battles, mini-games, and voice chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko31T8"&gt;And while initially surely driven by a desire for profit, &lt;em&gt;Red &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; had predicted (or perhaps hoped for) this kind of free and easy bartering. In-universe, it’s always been possible to upload your pokémon to a PC, and from there, send them all over the world. Nonplayable characters encourage trading as a cooperative, collaborative act. And as technology improved, Nintendo followed suit, making it increasingly easy to complete the pokédex or at least get the companions you like most. (Though its online efforts have not always run smoothly, and since 2018, it has also required a paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xzfCr1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Pokémon Go’ sold collaboration as a core concept&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIvvBh"&gt;Even once easy online trading was established, Nintendo continued to play with the formula. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; brought the Wonder Trade, allowing players to upload a random pokémon and receive one in return. Naturally, a lot of trades are bargain bin Pidgey and Bidoof, but there are always stories of exceptional generosity, with legendary pokémon, battle monsters with perfect stats, and specially colored shinies all making their way to an unsuspecting recipient. Community coordinated events have also seen experienced players releasing waves of pokémon holding expensive items on &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-pokemon-players-who-want-to-save-christmas-1673286147"&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt; to surprise kids playing for the first time. The latest entries, &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt;, introduced Max Raid pokémon, giant monsters that required cooperation with others to take down, and campsites that friends could visit to hang out in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4eBXi"&gt;And where Wonder Trade and Max Raid features leaned into the collaboration encouraged from the earliest days of the franchise, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; sold it as a core concept. Its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheOfficialPok%C3%A9monYouTubechannel"&gt;original announcement trailer&lt;/a&gt; showed families playing together, solo players meeting to trade, and huge group battles. Many of these features weren’t even in the game’s initial release or were so bare-bones as to be nonexistent — but it didn’t matter. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-review"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/12/pokemon-go-review-it-may-not-be-a-good-game-but-its-a-great-experience"&gt; consistently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/14/12183956/pokemon-go-review-ios-android-nintendo-niantic-company-mobile-game"&gt; agreed&lt;/a&gt;: the game wasn’t objectively especially good, but everyone was having a great time. The mechanics ended up being unnecessary for creating an astounding social experience. Before the pandemic, in-person festivals saw &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/gofest-dortmund-2019/?hl=en"&gt;tens&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/gofest-yokohama-2019/?hl=en"&gt;hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt; of players coming together to catch and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6vd07"&gt;Over time, it became clear that this was not simply because &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; was a phenomenon among an entire generation. The &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; game &lt;em&gt;Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;, released three years later by the same developers, had the same if not more cultural weight. But it never took off. According to mobile analytics company &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-has-best-year-ever-in-2019-catching-nearly-900m-usd-in-player-spending"&gt;Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;, in 2019, it netted just $23 million, compared to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s almost $900 million in the same year. In fact, this was an increase over &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s launch in 2016, indicating its longevity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEG1tf"&gt;The key thing that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; has that &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t is two and a half decades of community building. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potte&lt;/em&gt;r certainly has a fandom, a group of the most dedicated enthusiasts, but the book and movie formats are solo activities. To engage with &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; is to share. From the trading enforced by &lt;em&gt;Red &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt; to the family-friendly mini-games of &lt;em&gt;Stadium&lt;/em&gt; to the swapping with strangers via Wonder Trade, it has consistently encouraged cooperation and bonding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VpmEvI"&gt;Twenty-five years later, that’s still what makes it a phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motional is now testing fully autonomous vehicles in Las Vegas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfHnW-TOKaFrkLdDYKUm4-0ju0E=/0x1:1877x1252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854014/Motional1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Motional&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YF5vyI"&gt;Add Motional to the very short list of companies that have tested fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. The Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture announced that it has tested its vehicles without safety drivers behind the steering wheel on public streets in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zndvDl"&gt;The tests, which took place in February, came less than three months after the company received the green light from the state of Nevada to test its vehicles without a human safety driver. “Multiple driverless vehicles” were tested, conducting maneuvers such as “navigating intersections, unprotected turns, and interactions with other road users, including pedestrians and cyclists,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy93kU"&gt;Of course, there are some caveats. A Motional employee remained in the passenger seat during the tests, and was capable of stopping the vehicle if needed. (No interventions in vehicle operation by the passenger have been recorded yet, a Motional spokesperson said.) Motional is allowed to test anywhere in Las Vegas, but is keeping its vehicles in residential areas for now. And the company has only tested its vehicles during the daytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lelUPz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Motional sought a safety evaluation from an independent third party&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8vAcy"&gt;Motional is unique insofar as it sought a safety evaluation from an independent third party prior to conducting its fully autonomous testing. Germany’s &lt;a href="https://www.tuvsud.com/en-us"&gt;TÜV SÜD&lt;/a&gt; is a “world-leading independent technical service provider ... with extensive experience assessing driverless technology,” according to Motional. The firm was given access to the company’s proprietary systems, after which it endorsed Motional’s plan to operate with an empty driver’s seat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khqa53"&gt;Currently, only a small handful of AV operators have actually deployed fully driverless vehicles, also known as Level 4 autonomous vehicles, on public roads. Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet, has been operating its Level 4 vehicles in the suburbs of Phoenix for several years now, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;recently began offering rides to paying customers&lt;/a&gt;. Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165597/cruise-driverless-test-san-francisco-self-driving-level-4"&gt;recently started operating Level 4 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. Yandex, the Russian tech giant, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51003224"&gt;tested its Level 4 vehicles in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; during the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020. And Chinese tech firm Baidu started &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/fully-driverless-cars-are-being-tested-in-china-for-the-first-time.html"&gt;testing its vehicles without safety drivers&lt;/a&gt; in its home country late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnSMyi"&gt;Motional as a joint venture was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-autonomous-aptiv/hyundai-motor-group-aptiv-to-set-up-4-billion-self-driving-car-venture-idUSKBN1W80WP"&gt;first announced in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when Hyundai said it would spend $1.6 billion to catch up to its rivals in the autonomous vehicle space. Aptiv, a technology company formerly known as Delphi, owns 50 percent of the venture. The company currently has facilities in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Seoul, and has also tested its vehicles in Boston and Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDMqaU"&gt;Motional’s engineers were responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637822/self-driving-taxi-first-public-trial-singapore-nutonomy"&gt;the world’s first robotaxi pilot in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the first cross-country &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/driverless-car-road-trip-san-francisco-new-york-city/568939/"&gt;New York to San Francisco autonomous trip&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last two years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Aptiv’s fleet of safety driver-monitored autonomous taxis in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; (in partnership with Lyft) have completed over 100,000 trips. But the company’s Level 4 vehicles will be kept separate from its ride-hailing program with Lyft, so members of the public won’t be getting rides in fully driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns2eEO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is trying to counter misinformation about eating disorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UOzJXOxnONv10t6VOVQJlx8VRg=/0x16:781x537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854012/bOBEy_ag.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ctqnJX"&gt;TikTok is announcing today that it’s taking a couple small steps to try and help people who are affected by eating disorders. To do this, it’s partnering with the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org"&gt;National Eating Disorder Association&lt;/a&gt; (or NEDA) to have an eating disorder awareness week, and implementing two new features that aim to provide resources and support to those who need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9Oz3Kb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10354938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzFf6W"&gt;If a user searches TikTok for terms like “proana” (short for “pro-anorexia”), or “eating disorder,” the app will now show support resources, along with NEDA’s phone number.  Currently, searching the terms only shows the support number, but the new interface will also provide users with advice on how to deal with an eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8y6ulApq7xOOKmw9hVPalp7kwBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22316431/Eating_Disorder_Search_experience.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of just allowing the user to contact NEDA, the pages will also contain a link to resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESD_E32CrSo74ajupEQqRX795aI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22316437/Resources___Tips___expanded.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tips aim to help those who are struggling with eating disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8BlZEO"&gt;The company also plans on putting a PSA on hashtag pages that could potentially contain triggering content, like the page for #WhatIEatInADay. The PSA will include a link to NEDA’s helpline, as well as a number users can text for crisis support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpyqQd"&gt;TikTok is facing the same problem as many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2965449/instagram-self-harm-policy"&gt;other social media apps&lt;/a&gt;: how do you keep your users from posting or stumbling across potentially triggering and harmful content? TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/07/tiktok-investigating-videos-promoting-starvation-and-anorexia"&gt;has tried to deal with eating disorder content in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cameronwilson/tiktok-eating-disorder-videos-algorithm-for-you-page"&gt;users report that it still shows up&lt;/a&gt;. While today’s announcement doesn’t touch on actually moderating content, hopefully it can help make it easier for people who need help to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Mate X2 foldable adopts Samsung’s dual-screen design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1J-_p6smxsTD9tnRewI5aZrcjM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853932/image_178.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 has an 8-inch screen that folds inward.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVrUeQ"&gt;Huawei has announced the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, its first all-new foldable device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;since 2019’s Mate X&lt;/a&gt;. The new phone has received a radical redesign compared to the original device, with a large screen that unfolds from the inside of the device rather than around the outside. For using the phone while folded, the Huawei Mate X2 has a second screen on its outside, similar to Samsung’s approach with the Galaxy Fold series. Images of the phone were leaked minutes ahead of its official announcement by &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/huawei-mate-x2-first-official-images-1613994247-1984855950"&gt;Evan Blass on &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUTUPv"&gt;This being a Huawei device, the Mate X2 will launch without support for Google’s apps or services, which is likely to severely limit its appeal outside of China. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fmate-x2%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22294983%2Fhuawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huawei’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will run on EMUI 11.0 based on Android 10. However, during its live stream, the company said it plans for the Mate X2 to be among the first phones to be updated to its own operating system, HarmonyOS, starting in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjKndz"&gt;The internal screen on the Mate X2 measures 8 inches with a resolution of 2480 x 2200, while the exterior screen is 6.45 inches with a 2700 x 1160 resolution. Both are OLED and have refresh rates of up to 90Hz. They’re also both slightly bigger than the 7.6-inch internal display and 6.2-inch external displays found on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;. Internally, the phone is powered by the company’s flagship Kirin 9000 chip, the processor that debuted in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529915/huawei-mate-40-pro-hands-on"&gt;Mate 40 Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and a battery with a rated capacity of 4,400mAh that can be fast-charged at up to 55W. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Yg-uODZq9hpnIhWL4-EpjdiE2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320067/msedge_6RvUDEI1g5.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mate X2 is available in four colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GsHFfr"&gt;There are four cameras on the rear of the phone: a 50-megapixel wide-angle, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, a 12-megapixel telephoto with a 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel “SuperZoom” camera with a 10x optical zoom. The selfie camera on the outside of the phone has a 16-megapixel resolution, and there doesn’t appear to be a selfie camera in or around the foldable inner screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMPOaj"&gt;The Mate X2 is technically the third phone in Huawei’s foldable lineup. Last year, it released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the original Mate X, which featured a more durable display and faster Kirin 990 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjsHSx"&gt;Huawei says the Mate X2 will be available in China with 256GB of internal storage for ¥17,999 (around $2,785) or for ¥18,999 (around $2,940) with 512GB of storage. Available colors include blue, pink, black, and white. It’ll be available to buy in China on February 25th, but it’s unclear when the phone could be released outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
