    <title>Mortal Kombat’s producer says the movie’s violence is ‘like Bambi’ compared to the games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjWxp2EL8750cwK_WbvGtkMRDsw=/554x0:2354x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981126/MK_T1_0073r.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6jNf9D"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jBa_aHwCbC4"&gt;recent trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming movie adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; makes the film look &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; violent. In one scene, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; icon Sub-Zero slices an opponent’s arm with a sword, freezes the resulting blood splatter into a dagger, and uses that blood dagger to stab his foe. But in an interview this week, producer Todd Garner told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the movie’s violence isn’t nearly as over-the-top as it is in the classic game series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyworz"&gt;“Compared to the game, we’re like Bambi,” says Garner. “We’re like a G-rated movie compared to the game. The game is just incredibly operatic in terms of the violence, and the Motion Picture Association of America would never let us do that much violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnzO94h_Sab1FY2W-6rh-9KPuIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376688/MK_T1_0061.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9QIvyg"&gt;Fights in the &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; games are brutal, with blood often appearing following each punch, kick, throw, or weapon slice. And the series is famous for its Fatality finishing moves, where characters murder their opponents in exceedingly gruesome ways. (They often involve some kind of dismemberment.) Violence is part of playing the game, and it’s something that has only become more extreme as the series has progressed. In fact, it can be so bad that it’s even &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691"&gt;impacted members of the development team&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie isn’t trying to violence for violence’s sake, though, according to Garner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUEAjM"&gt;“We’re trying to make a movie where you care about the people, it’s grounded, it has a realistic tone to it, and the violence comes from the rules of the world that have been established, but you’re not just trying to make torture porn,” he says. “You’re trying to do something that is faithful to the IP, but also comes from a motivated and grounded place that is motivated by real characters that feel like they’ve lived real lives up until this moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hySmo45NrPL7PQZnecIFOtK1cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376684/MK_T1_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FjDqnr"&gt;In a separate interview, director Simon McQuoid talked about how he wanted to do right by the series by including violence, but that also allowed him to make a more authentic movie. “I just wanted to do &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; justice,” McQuoid says. “It was about studying and looking at what the fundamental ingredients are of &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat.&lt;/em&gt; What are the key strands of DNA that make this what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5K2lG"&gt;“One of those, obviously, is kind of the brutality [of the series],” he says. “And what I liked about the blood aspect of that is that we could be authentic. We didn’t have to hold back on the fights.” For example, if somebody was stabbed through the head, “blood probably would burst down the back,” McQuoid notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHYmKR"&gt;McQuoid’s not just saying that hypothetically. I’ve seen the first 13 minutes of the film, which included a big, blade-filled fight scene. And one of its most memorable moments features a knife being plunged into the top of someone’s head, and yes, blood does seep from the wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6trSdp"&gt;But while the movie could come across as overly violent, “everyone knows &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat &lt;/em&gt;is known for that and was OK sort of doing that,” McQuoid says. “It wasn’t a great surprise. It’s not like it’s a Jane Austen novel that we’re turning super violent. That would not be good.” The violence “matters for this property,” he says. “It allowed us to be authentic in a stylistic approach and [it was] also just what’s right for &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emgyiw"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie will hit theaters and HBO Max on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’ll start punishing group members who break its rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGcD1yk2IjFys6qi0WAub8Mcro0=/0x0:2808x1872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981123/fbgroups.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QMxcfI"&gt;Facebook is trying to clean up its Groups experience and limit the reach of potentially problematic users and communities. The company announced multiple changes to groups today, including plans to put users who break rules on probation, further limit the reach of civic and political groups, and require more moderation in groups that have violated Facebook’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a12u55"&gt;Group members who break Facebook’s rules will suffer various new consequences. Initially, people with repeat violations will be prevented from posting or commenting in any group for a certain period of time. A spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this time could be either seven or 30 days, depending on the number of violations and the severity of them. They also won’t be able to invite other people to any groups or create new groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilNvXr"&gt;One of the biggest changes is around members who break rules. Groups that have numerous violations will soon come with a warning label, too. Whenever a user tries to join one of these groups, they’ll receive a disclaimer that the group has violated community standards, which might dissuade them from joining. Facebook will also limit invite notifications for these groups. For existing members, the company will reduce the distribution of the group’s content, meaning it’ll be shown lower in the News Feed. (It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554349/facebook-groups-probation-violating-rules-misinformation-election"&gt;first piloted&lt;/a&gt; this functionality around the 2020 US presidential election, but it’s now making it a regular feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buFZgr"&gt;Finally, these violating groups’ admins and moderators will have to temporarily approve all posts whenever the group has a substantial number of members who have violated policies or were part of other groups that were removed for breaking the rules. If these admins or moderators just approve everything, even content that breaks the rules, the entire group will be taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bCKw0"&gt;As a broader update, Facebook started removing civic and political groups &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55842587"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, as well as newly created groups, from recommendations in the US. It’s now making that the standard worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBCNIs"&gt;Facebook has received much criticism for allowing &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/facebook-profit-militant-extremist-groups-ads"&gt;extremist political groups&lt;/a&gt;, as well as groups that spread conspiracy theories or anti-vax rhetoric, to thrive on its platform. As one example, members of the group that plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/"&gt;used Facebook groups to organize&lt;/a&gt;, according to an FBI affidavit. And in the past, even its attempts to limit the reach of political groups have failed, according to &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/19/facebook-said-it-would-stop-pushing-users-to-join-partisan-political-groups-it-didnt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which found that political recommendations still showed up for users. (A Facebook spokesperson says this error has now been corrected.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PntBqo"&gt;The company continues to be in a game of whack-a-mole, where it attempts to squash the bad groups and members, only to see others sprout up. These new rules might dissuade some people from behaving badly or limit their time on the platform, but there’s always a chance that they just create a new account or skirt around the rules without breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s midrange phones now feature fast refresh rate screens, stabilized cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69CPj9-NiG1F8ABRAFuhYmI4OH4=/0x330:4000x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980752/32_galaxya52_a72_white_black_210310001526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A72 feature quad rear-camera arrays, though the A72 includes a telephoto rather than depth-sensing camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJQJa4"&gt;At its second Unpacked event of the year, Samsung officially unveiled three of its next A-series phones: the Galaxy A52, A52 5G, and A72. While the company isn’t sharing US pricing or availability yet, it has confirmed European pricing: €349 for the A52 (about $415), €429 for the A52 5G (about $510), and €449 for the A72 ($534).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laK8jm"&gt;Key specs across the board include IP67 water and dust resistance, brighter screens with faster refresh rates, and a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. All three models include a microSD card slot for expandable storage and will ship with a charging brick in the box — features that you won’t find in the S21-series flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24r4ZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Lex2"&gt;Each is built on an unspecified octa-core (dual 2.3GHz + hexa 1.8GHz) processor and will ship with Android 11 and Samsung’s One UI 3.0. Storage variants of 128GB and 256GB will be offered for all models, with RAM configurations that will vary by region. The devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;meet the hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; to receive three generations of Android OS platform updates, and like all recent Galaxy phones, are guaranteed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;at least four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPhNi"&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A52 5G will both feature a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screens. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;As rumored&lt;/a&gt;, the A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen. Each will feature a rear “quad” camera array, though one of those four cameras is a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The main 64-megapixel f/1.8 camera is accompanied by a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide 5-megapixel macro and 32-megapixel f/2.2 selfie cam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tM8wo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFaxC9"&gt;Samsung says the A52 models feature brighter screens — up to 800 nits as compared to last year’s 600 — and 4,500mAh batteries capable of two days’ use on a single charge. And naturally, the A52 5G includes 5G connectivity, though Samsung hasn’t confirmed yet which frequencies it will support in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQP3P2"&gt;The Galaxy A72 offers a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers the same basic rear camera array but includes an 8-megapixel f/2.4 3x telephoto camera instead of the depth sensor. The A72 is an LTE-only model; a 5G version is likely to come but Samsung hasn’t confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVmRRQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkerI"&gt;We should find out US pricing and availability for these devices — and potentially other A-series models — in the next few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;Last year’s&lt;/a&gt; A51 and A51 5G were introduced at $400 and $500, respectively, with the 5G version of the A71 coming in at $600. If this year’s models are priced similarly, these devices will be well-positioned to tempt midrange shoppers with features like fast refresh rate screens, stabilized main cameras, and IP ratings, which aren’t common in this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvSpSx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 17th, 7:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Added information about Android platform OS updates.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right) | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for $35 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 more than its lowest price yet. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information on sale for $45 (usually $60). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $45 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40; right now it is on sale for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $60 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Amazon is selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo for two Philips Hue bulbs&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $160&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $40 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c8b1ed4e46d21c7660ba5ae3006737b8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $51, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $85 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;There are no active deals going on right now for the Echo Show 10, but if you just want the device itself, you can get it for its usual price of $250 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kppkjv"&gt;There are, however, a few bundles going on that throw in an additional item alongside the Echo Show 10. At Amazon, can buy the Echo Show 10 and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FRR5V57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $40 on a one-year subscription&lt;/a&gt; to Food Network Kitchen. Additionally, the e-commerce site is offering a promotion, where you can save $100 off the price of two Echo Show 10 devices when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;SHOW102PACK &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGQIus"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329393970906605#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also have a bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini HD security camera for $255.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 8 that’s 5G-ready on Verizon and other carriers is nearly half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5o4K1c5CNAQrdSPOZFznB0CtG1I=/4x0:2296x1528/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980831/vzw.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kdyIku"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering the best price we’ve seen on the OnePlus 8 in the onyx black colorway. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615543-REG%2Foneplus_5011101036_8_5g_uw_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22335683%2Foneplus-8-verizon-amazon-echo-dot-clock-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Originally $800, it’s just $450&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date"&gt;unlocked Verizon variant&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only version that supports UWB 5G and sub-6GHz 5G when connected to Verizon’s network. Alternatively, it works with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks if you’re with either of those. This model originally sold for more than the base OnePlus 8 because of its Verizon 5G compatibility, but at this point, B&amp;amp;H’s deal knocks its price down below that of the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWvJSD"&gt;This model has a 6.5-inch OLED screen that has a 90Hz refresh rate. It features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. We’re close to OnePlus announcing its latest phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, though we don’t know yet how much that will cost. It’s safe to assume, though, it’ll likely cost much more than this discounted phone today. And with these specs and its 5G compatibility, you might not miss out on much by opting for the OnePlus 8 instead of waiting on the new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kRfMKi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ep6jbZ"&gt;It’s been a while since Amazon ran discounts on its latest Echo hardware, but you can get some decent price cuts today. One of its most useful devices, the Echo Dot with a built-in digital clock, is $15 off its usual price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085M66LH1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This makes it $45&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is a little backed up on orders, claiming to deliver in late March or early April, depending on your color preference, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735153130507205842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is also honoring the deal&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer to not wait as long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2468nN"&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;my colleague Dan Seifert’s review of the new Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which he claims have better sound quality than the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="go4yG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397064"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRjaCpdNZS-Z545s1XVCsD1Oetc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21920671/XGP_EAPlay_HERO.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psXZw6"&gt;If you game on Xbox One or one of the new Series X or Series S consoles, there’s still a way to get four months’ worth of Game Pass Ultimate for cheaper than usual. First, you’ll need to get a one-year subscription to EA Play, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014Q5UNH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which costs $30&lt;/a&gt;. When you redeem it on your console, Microsoft will automatically convert it to a four-month Game Pass Ultimate subscription (usually $60 total).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JJfFw"&gt;Many games available through EA Play are on Game Pass now, in addition to a fleet of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;newly added Bethesda games&lt;/a&gt; since Microsoft recently acquired the game publisher and its many studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6pchGC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iJosoU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfydKphyuEnfrEBj3Y6ZnqVFCR0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980827/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_screen_14_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Twelve months of turnips, K.K. Slider, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="RIRTH7"&gt;It took less than a year for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to become one of the Nintendo Switch’s defining games. Launching around the same time that millions of people were forced inside due to the pandemic, and with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188006/animal-crossing-new-horizons-design-interview-aya-kyogoku-hisashi-nogami"&gt;a new design philosophy meant to shake up the series&lt;/a&gt;, the game became a cultural phenomenon. It turned into a social space where millions — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238703/animal-crossing-new-horizons-streetwear-fashion-outfits-nintendo-switch"&gt;streetwear enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22321111/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-archive-one-year-anniversary"&gt;museums&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/4/23/21233424/elijah-wood-animal-crossing-turnip-prices-stalk-market"&gt;movie stars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257183/animal-talking-new-horizons-elijah-wood-danny-trejo-gary-whitta-late-night-show"&gt;talk show hosts&lt;/a&gt; — could relax in a calm, quiet virtual world. As the community continued to find new and inventive ways to play, Nintendo steadily updated &lt;em&gt;New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;with new features and content. It’s gone on to sell more than 30 million copies to date — and it doesn’t look like things will slow down anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="62ZQSp"&gt;I never play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on mute. I love hearing the grass crunching under my character’s shoes, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2020/3/22/21188355/animal-crossing-new-horizons-language-video"&gt;the cutesy language that all of the villagers speak&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, the sound effects tied to all of the emotes, like the signature piano noise that plays right before you’re about to get messed up by a bunch of angry bees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHjULa"&gt;But what makes the game really worth listening to closely is the music — specifically K.K. Slider’s tunes. He’s the king of cool, a crooning pup star among a bunch of normies that inhabit your island. And for the kind of dreadful year that 2020 was shaping up to be when &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; released, hearing K.K. Slider’s work was a beam of positivity that took me and my apartment over completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8zDBt"&gt;If you’ve played &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; games before, then you may already know several of the songs. But despite seeing him guest DJ every night at Club LOL in &lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt; for the 3DS — my first serious foray into the franchise — the music didn’t really resonate with me then. Maybe it was the small screen or the tiny speakers. But when I hear one of K.K. Slider’s tunes in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; with my Switch docked, I want to get up and dance... or at least engage in some serious head-bobbing. And for much of last year, that deep catalog of tunes was all I was humming between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjK2Bb"&gt;Most of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ music is comprised of acoustic, playful pop and light jazz grooves, but K.K.’s music dives more deeply into capturing different moods and genres. “K.K. Ska,” for instance, is a pop tune that can apparently be repurposed for wholesome memes. It didn’t really hit me just &lt;em&gt;how good&lt;/em&gt; this song was until I heard it attached to this very cheerful video on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ncTsuD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfkViWKucCU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZHtxR"&gt;If that kind of music doesn’t strike your fancy, how about something like “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Gx1skphZw"&gt;K.K. Cruisin’&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyI106n2AvI"&gt;K.K. Groove&lt;/a&gt;,” or “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khoe2zCjZpk"&gt;K.K. Metal&lt;/a&gt;”? The catalog of tunes runs the gamut of new and older popular genres, plus a few oddities to show off Nintendo’s music-writing chops even more. The art team clearly had fun designing the album covers, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhbU19"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH33m9jfwyg"&gt;K.K. Jazz&lt;/a&gt;” cops the signature styling of a Blue Note Records jazz album — label insignia, two-toned layout, and all. Given the way &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; took off after launch, it’s no surprise people &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/21/21228752/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-kk-slider-redraw-challenge-music-album-covers-nintendo-switch"&gt;started drawing their own K.K. Slider-inspired album art for real music&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ky5BY-_CZMLEUtUELxT1Ti0qF48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374931/kkslidercomparo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo isn’t subtle about its inspirations for K.K. Slider’s album art.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aENV86"&gt;Most of the songs in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; aren’t new, but my enjoyment this time around had a lot to do with Nintendo’s methodical rollout (or withholding, depending on how you look at it) of K.K. Slider. Instead of having him immediately available to jam out, he’s struck it big as a musician and doesn’t have time for you and your island until you’ve proven it’s a happening place. It’s the end goal for the narrative of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, and it feels like a real achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oHx8De"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a crooning pup star among a bunch of normies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACJYlH"&gt;While you work toward that goal, you can buy different K.K. Slider songs through the Nook Stop PC located in the Resident Services building. It’s usually possible to get a new song every couple of days. And with enough time, you’ll have a sizable catalog of songs that can play from a stereo in your home or a boombox to set up outside for other villagers to listen (and sometimes hum along) to. The music even sounds different, depending on the kind of stereo you purchase. Some gadgets add crackles to make K.K.’s songs sound like they’re on vinyl, and buying the full DJ kit really adds a lot of bass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUn1OA"&gt;Nintendo could have easily let the player stream K.K. Slider tunes through the Nook Phone. Instead, it turned the game’s main musical act into something you had to work toward and pay dearly to fully experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="KK Slider" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OgPNX6Qq14K5LQ58prD4jwQH3Co=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375177/kkslidergif.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6AUsiM"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; hub on &lt;a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/K.K._Slider_song_list_(New_Horizons)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fandom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are 95 original compositions in the game. It’s well worth asking K.K. Slider to play one of them during his weekly visits, as you’ll get both a live acoustic performance and a bootleg for later use in a stereo at your home within the game. If you don’t want to go through that, just load some songs on YouTube. And if you really want to fall down a rabbit hole, people have contributed an endless trove of DIY covers in K.K. Slider’s vocal styling on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLNEgM"&gt;Now that we’re at the anniversary of the launch of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, there aren’t many stones (proverbial, or otherwise) that I’ve left unturned. But whenever I do boot up the game, I’m always pleased to hear the songs that helped make my experience of living through 2020 a bit more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unagi is expanding its electric scooter subscription service to more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gPDPDgejD6la-_mUtdDWD8JbvkM=/0x0:2732x1821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980503/Unagi_Marek_Dziekonski_optimized_online16_res.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Unagi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eq38P9"&gt;Unagi, maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/17/18080142/unagi-electric-scooter-kickstarter-price-specs"&gt;stylish electric scooters&lt;/a&gt;, is bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21352552/unagi-electric-scooter-subscription-price-cities"&gt;nascent subscription service&lt;/a&gt; to more cities. After testing out its $40-a-month service in small parts of New York City and Los Angeles, the Oakland, California-based company is expanding its service area in both cities, while also bringing it to seven new markets, including San Francisco, Austin, Seattle, Phoenix, Miami, and Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwr8XJ"&gt;Helping fuel its growth, the company also just closed its first round of fundraising for $10.5 million, led by the Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from Menlo Ventures, Broadway Angels, and Gaingels, among others. Flush with cash, Unagi plans on adding more cities in the months ahead and is eyeing a launch in Europe as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJq7I7"&gt;“We understood that there are a lot of people who have fear of commitment,” Unagi CEO David Hyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s partially generational. There’s a large generation of consumers that prefer access over ownership.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B6mFnXNQKrP6Uurtqpf070Dt3Xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376918/_IMG_2106_cropped__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Unagi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m7e6SO"&gt;Unagi first launched its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funagiscooters.com%2Fpages%2Funagi-all-access-scooter-subscription%2F%3Fshow_sub_signup%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22334608%2Funagi-electric-scooter-subscription-expansion-cities-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;All-Access subscription service&lt;/a&gt; last August in a few neighborhoods in New York City and LA. Hyman said the demand was “incredible,” though he declined to share any specifics figures. With the added cities, Hyman said Unagi All-Access will be available to over 30 million people — roughly one-tenth of the population of the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1UBfu"&gt;There will be some changes to the original subscription. The price is increasing from $39 to $49 a month. There’s still an initial $50 service fee, but Unagi is now requiring subscribers to commit to at least three months before canceling. Maintenance and insurance from scooter theft or damage are also included in the monthly fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PxgSY5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We understood that there are a lot of people who have fear of commitment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IuNjXw"&gt;Originally, Unagi promised to deliver the scooter to customers within 24 hours. With the expanded service area and new markets, that wait time is being increased to 72 hours for at least the first four weeks after launch. After that point, the scooters should arrive via FedEx in under 48 hours. Previously, the scooters were being hand-delivered by a courier; now, they will arrive in the mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H3tWV"&gt;“It’s almost like a Netflix DVD mailer, but just much bigger,” Hyman said of the new packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmbHN0"&gt;Those interested in subscribing to an Unagi scooter should check the company’s website to ensure they reside in the service area. Another change from the initial service is a range of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054731/unagi-electric-scooter-dual-motor-color-paint-job-customize"&gt;colorful options&lt;/a&gt;. Subscribers can choose between four different colors for their scooter: “cosmic blue,” “sea salt” (white), “matte black,” and “scarlet fire.” (Hyman is an avowed Deadhead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wHyGL"&gt;Like most electric scooters, Unagi’s vehicles are made in China. But unlike the hordes of cheap scooters you can find on Amazon, these scooters have a definite premium feel. Unagi’s Model One scooter has two electric motors, giving it slightly more power than your average Lime or Bird scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW59Fy"&gt;Despite the addition of another motor, the scooter is still comparatively lightweight, clocking in at only 26 pounds. The scooter has three drive modes: Beginner (9-11 mph), Advanced (13-15 mph), and Professional (15-19 mph). The lithium-ion battery allows for a range of up to 15.5 miles. And Unagi uses a blend of aluminum and carbon fiber for the frame, helping save on weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLk34g"&gt;Unagi will sanitize each scooter before sending it out to customers, but subscribers are not guaranteed to get a brand-new scooter. That’s what makes this business model work, Hyman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DvKAr"&gt;Unagi isn’t the first scooter company to dip its toes into the world of subscriptions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523121/bird-electric-scooter-delivery-monthly-rental-sf-barcelona"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025818/lime-limepass-weekly-subscription-electric-scooters-bicycles-rental-rideables-micromobility"&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt; have been experimenting with subscriptions for their shared electric scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747817/bird-electric-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-bike-app-review"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. And electric bikes are jumping on the subscription bandwagon, too, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;Revel in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Dance in Berlin, and Swapfiets and VanMoof as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgFNGx"&gt;Hyman said the initial six months of All-Access has proven to him that scooter subscriptions can work on a wider level. Still, there will be other metrics to keep an eye on. “We’re convinced internally, but some things you can only prove with time. Right?” he said. “Like, how long does the scooter last? What are all the service costs to keep that scooter running over its lifetime? What does consumer retention and churn rates look like? It’s a longitudinal exercise that some things can only prove with time. But we feel like the data points we have are pretty conclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxBfFC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel puts Apple’s ‘I’m a Mac’ guy into new ads praising PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uLT12mJPm7oEwJ0bBp5O7qEk-1o=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980460/LDTTUmg.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMO1fM"&gt;Intel has hired Apple’s former “I’m a Mac” actor Justin Long to create new ads praising PCs. Long starts each commercial with “Hello I’m a... Justin,” with the typical white background you’d find on Apple’s Mac vs. PC ads from the 2000s. Naturally, the ads focus on Mac vs. PC again, with Long mocking Apple’s Touch Bar, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WfHplU5fatE"&gt;lack of M1 multiple monitor support&lt;/a&gt;, and the “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;gray and grayer&lt;/a&gt;” color choices for a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0THmCs"&gt;One even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;goes all-in&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s lack of touchscreens in Macs or 2-in-1 support by mocking the fact you have to buy a tablet, keyboard, stylus, and even a dongle to match what’s available on rival Intel-based laptops. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8HebkohrCns"&gt;Another ad&lt;/a&gt; also points out that “no one really games on a Mac.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PaSRqw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gtRRMd2_UI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5HdBA"&gt;The return of Justin Long in Mac vs. PC ads for Intel comes just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558977/apple-pc-guy-classic-m1-performance-john-hodgman"&gt;Apple brought back actor John Hodgman&lt;/a&gt; to reprise his role as the PC guy from Apple’s “I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” ad campaign. While Apple kept its reprisal limited to the company’s keynote to introduce Arm-based M1 MacBooks, Intel has gone a step further and revived this for full commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GidON"&gt;Intel is clearly ready to battle Apple’s first chips with marketing, but we’re still waiting for the company to respond with its own silicon advances. Intel has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;produced benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; so far. Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has also already made it clear that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232554/intel-ceo-apple-lifestyle-company-cpus-comment"&gt;Intel has to beat Apple in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a metal with a memory will shape our future on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ey5U69BFx4KV62u4wPNVr7Js-tg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980439/Textless_Thumb_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIpUSh"&gt;A rover on the Moon has metal wheels that can flex around rocky obstacles, then reshape back to their original form. On Earth, surgeons install tiny mesh tubes that can dilate a heart patient’s blood vessels all on their own, without mechanical inputs or any wires to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yEjcK"&gt;These shape-shifting capabilities are all thanks to a bizarre kind of metal called nitinol, a so-called shape-metal alloy that can be trained to remember its own shape. The decades-old material has become increasingly common in a wide range of everyday applications. And in the next decade, the metal will face its most challenging application yet: a sample return mission on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfvKxU"&gt;Nitinol, made of nickel and titanium, works its magic through heat. To “train” a paper clip made of nitinol, for example, you heat it at 500 degrees Celsius in its desired shape, then splash it in cold water. Bend it out of shape, then return the same heat source, and the metal will eerily slink back into its original form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEn9YC"&gt;The temperature that triggers nitinol’s transformation varies depending on the fine-tuned ratio of nickel to titanium. Engineers can tweak the metal to adapt to a wide array of conditions, making it a key tool in places where complex mechanics won’t fit, like the blood vessels surrounding a human heart or a hinge that positions a solar panel by responding to the sun’s heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djnD67"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with engineers at NASA’s Glenn Research Center to see how nitinol will play a role in a mission to retrieve humanity’s first cache of pristine Martian soil samples — the second leg of a Mars mission campaign led by NASA and the European Space Agency. Check out the video above to see how and to see nitinol in action. (We promise, it’s not CGI.)&lt;/p&gt;
