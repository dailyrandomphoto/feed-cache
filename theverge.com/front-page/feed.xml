    <title>Apple extends reprieve, won’t take a cut of online classes and events until next year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vl0knn"&gt;Apple announced on Wednesday that it’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6qfoid1d&amp;amp;1619114022"&gt;once again extending the deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for iOS apps that sell access to online classes and group events until December 31st, 2021, effectively meaning it won’t impose its 30 percent cut on businesses providing those services until next year. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21595040/apple-developer-in-app-purchase-deadline-online-classes-events"&gt;extended the deadline initially to June 30th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but now developers have another six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TeBrI"&gt;Apple cites the ongoing pandemic as its main justification for the change, but we have to wonder if it might also have something to do with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;the Congressional antitrust hearings that have zeroed in on whether Apple and Google’s app stores are monopolies&lt;/a&gt;. Helping out small businesses by not taking its traditional 30 percent cut is an example Apple can now use to demonstrate how it encourages small businesses to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGWxmt"&gt;Wednesday’s &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/antitrust-applied-examining-competition-in-app-stores"&gt;“Antitrust Applied: Examining Competition in App Stores”&lt;/a&gt; hearing featured complaints from lost item tracker company Tile, who Apple is now in direct competition with thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s new AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and Match Group, whose Tinder dating app uses Apple’s in-app purchases for subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oDlVz"&gt;Not every company pays 30 percent. Apple doesn’t apply the same in-app purchases requirement to one-on-one classes like tutoring, so individuals can take other forms of payments and bypass Apple’s cut entirely. Apple’s also been criticized for quietly creating special deals for big companies like Amazon, where subscriptions sold on its Prime Video app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;are only subject to a 15 percent fee&lt;/a&gt;. (Generally, Apple doesn’t reduce its cut of subscription fees to 15 percent until users have been subscribed for a full year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGfuN5"&gt;After Amazon’s seeming sweetheart deal came to light, Apple launched a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021 where developers who earn less than $1 million in sales every year can apply to lower Apple’s commission to 15 percent on purchases — but only with Apple’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIcV8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;Apple is now launching podcast subscriptions too&lt;/a&gt;, ones where podcasters can join by paying $19.99 a year plus 30 percent of each subscriber’s first year of revenue, then 15 percent after for subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mortal Kombat movie is at its best when it mimics the games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D-XoNto9QrBLmqi_NZvmTt9TX84=/356x0:1565x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69172465/rev_1_MK_FP_0004_High_Res_JPEG.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yEqSRe"&gt;For a series about people getting their spines ripped out, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; has a surprising amount of story. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512337/mortal-kombat-11-ps4-xbox-switch-ed-boon-interview"&gt;Over three decades&lt;/a&gt; the fighting franchise has amassed a large mythos, filled with histories, lore, and motivations for its many combatants, which are mostly used to answer the question of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; somebody is having their spine and / or arms removed. You wouldn’t really know that from watching the new movie, though. The film features plenty of callouts to the games — gruesome fatalities, goofy one-liners, and lots of familiar faces — but it never stops long enough to tell you why you should care about anything. It’s also not particularly fun, despite all of the aforementioned ripped-off arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l85XAv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat &lt;/em&gt;largely follows the same basic premise as the games, where champions from Earth face off against creatures from a place called the Netherrealm in a fighting tournament, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. In the movie, there’s a slight twist as Earth’s champions are chosen for this task — and they know they’re chosen because they all have matching &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; dragon logo birthmarks. Unfortunately, their Netherrealm counterparts have decided not to play fair and are hunting down Earth fighters ahead of the tournament, so that they can win by default.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDG2z7FnJDPBY4tvY3xgnlg-tI0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462926/rev_1_MKM_T1_0061_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ngiWwP"&gt;Of course, that premise is mostly just a way to explain the action, and, for the most part, the film does deliver on that front. In the early stages, you get to see exactly why Sub-Zero is so feared; he uses his ice powers to terrorize an entire city block and, yes, rip off someone’s arms. (Sorry Jax.) Later, when the two realms face off, it’s an incredible spectacle. There’s a sequence where an invisible Reptile is stabbed with a flare so he can be tracked in the dark, as well as an absolutely brutal battle with a very CG-looking Goro — &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;’s iconic four-armed warrior — who doesn’t have four arms by the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="vRvl25"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10460665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="elVyls"&gt;But the story gets in the way of all that. The setup is a bit like a big superhero epic, with a bunch of superpowered folks banding together to fight a common foe. But unlike, say, &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t spend nearly enough time introducing its huge cast. The first half of the almost two-hour-long movie is a blur, racing from one character to the next, while also trying to set up the rules of this unique fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UASYlw"&gt;It’s both too much and not enough: there’s an overwhelming amount of information, but the movie doesn’t give you a reason to care about any of it. I couldn’t tell you much about the main cast aside from basic details like “washed-up MMA fighter” or “really serious army guy.” There are plenty of dramatic moments and twists where it’s clear the movie &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; you to be emotionally invested, but they never hit as intended. It’s also seriously lacking a sense of humor. The closest thing to a joke you’ll find is when someone points out that “kombat” is spelled wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOJEwLRi7DagjxgiLfWuvJeTbII=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462930/rev_1_MK_FP_0010_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C0cDbJ"&gt;The movie is actually at its best when it mimics the games. In a sequence toward the end, fighters are warped around the world for one-on-one battles complete with gruesome fatalities. There are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of deaths in &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;, and, just like in the games, they’re gleefully sadistic. Heads get sawed in half, limbs are lopped off, and blood flows freely. Someone even says “flawless victory” after a particularly bloody kill. The fighting is a great mixture of almost balletic martial arts and vicious violence. It looks cool and it hits hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhO88S"&gt;There just isn’t enough of it. If &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat &lt;/em&gt;was nothing more than a steady stream of carefully choreographed fights and inventive deaths, I’d be all for it. That’s kind of the franchise’s whole deal. But instead it spends far too much energy on the how and why, without actually delving deep enough to make either compelling. It wants to be both a ridiculous action movie &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a serious one, and those two sides never fully gel. Even worse, it’s barely a complete story; instead of a true ending, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; finishes with a giant tease for another movie. It’s like a two-hour-long prologue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6B0zb"&gt;Playing &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; is brutal and bloody, but it’s also a lot of fun — the movie is missing out on much of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Warzone pulls a Fortnite with the launch of its new map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vV57SPrM9w8C8qSw95r54o2-cw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69172111/cod_warzone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhFLey"&gt;After launching a little over a year ago, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular free-to-play titles right now, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396481/call-of-duty-warzone-100-million-players-apex-legends"&gt;100 million people&lt;/a&gt; playing the battle royale shooter. Following a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/call-of-duty/22396153/call-of-duty-warzone-destruction-of-verdansk-part-1-nuke-servers-event-playlist-bug-crash"&gt;nuclear missile that destroyed the game’s map&lt;/a&gt;, the in-game city of Verdansk is back with a new map set in the year 1984, as seen in the announcement trailer above. This mirrors a similar move made by its competitor &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;destroyed its original map&lt;/a&gt; and replaced it with a new one in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5m1762"&gt;Despite the shape and layout remaining the same as its predecessor, players will notice changes to most locations along with a 1980s vibe that fits the game’s new time period. Verdansk ’84, the name of the new map, has some alterations to make it a new location and not a direct reskin, while also becoming more closely integrated with &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, which is set in the same decade. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552437/call-of-duty-warzone-player-progression-weapons-cosmetics-shared-unified-black-ops-cold-war"&gt;Both games share content across one another&lt;/a&gt;, meaning weapons, cosmetics, and other in-game unlockables like killstreaks can be shared across both titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPvdIk"&gt;The debut of Verdansk ’84 serves as an official start to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RavenSoftware/status/1385065877754716166?s=20"&gt;third season of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s available now with plenty of new weapons added and a few old ones nerfed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHHzxp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook pivots from politics to ‘inspiration’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-izgVZPVUuVj_JebfaqMsm62EI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69172064/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHz4r3"&gt;Facebook wants to inspire, apparently. The company announced changes to its News Feed today that are supposed to fill feeds with things users like, rather than the content that annoys them. At the end of March, Facebook began introducing filters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359782/facebook-news-feed-turn-off-algorithmic-ranking-favorites-most-recent-filter-bar"&gt;to allow users to customize their feed&lt;/a&gt;, and now, the company is hoping to learn more about what users like and dislike, with what seems like a special focus on &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/incorporating-more-feedback-into-news-feed-ranking/"&gt;moving away from political content and toward “inspirational posts.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vi9f5"&gt;The company has been under intense scrutiny for helping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16449976/facebook-political-ads-trump-russia-election-news-feed"&gt;fan the flames of political division&lt;/a&gt; in the US and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055348/facebook-trump-election-2020-leaked-memo-bosworth"&gt;playing an outsized role in elections&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s influence on both issues has largely stemmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183341/facebook-misinformation-report-nathalie-marechal"&gt;from the misinformation&lt;/a&gt; that’s been spread on the platform. It’s an issue that seems directly connected to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg taking an aggressive stance in support of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21537040/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-section-230-hearing-reform-pact-act-big-tech"&gt;replacing Section 230&lt;/a&gt; of the Communications Decency Act in 2020. Facebook hasn’t named a specific alternative it supports, but it generally favors the government having more control (and receiving more blame) for moderating inflammatory speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nyDfh8WfyOxf3ONCto3JJm25FlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462834/NRP_NF_Ranking_Product_01.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s new survey questions will include gauging whether a post is inspiring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng51P7"&gt;I’m not sure inspiring posts are the News Feed cure the company should be hoping for, though. Facebook is planning to survey users on what posts they find inspiring to adjust how News Feed ranks content. According to Facebook, users want inspirational content because it “motivates them and can be useful to them outside of Facebook.” It’s certainly a nice idea, but who or what people find inspiring could vary wildly. Per a statement Facebook provided &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="H3kfIu"&gt;For the purposes of our surveys, we’ll ask people how inspiring they find a given post on their News Feeds, so we’re leaving it up to them as to what they find inspirational. According to feedback sessions we’ve conducted, though, people have told us they find content to be “inspiring” if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9oPKM"&gt;It gives them positive, new ideas to do something different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBo6l2"&gt;It’s information that changes their thinking or perceptions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOOd6Y"&gt;It provokes uplifting and creative thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eaOciD"&gt;As Facebook suggests in its original blog post, “a photo of a national park can inspire someone to spend more time in nature,” but it’s not hard to imagine other photos and posts that are much more controversial earning a similar rating of “inspiring” from some users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8kHbk2GQH7y0UHWVL-XbiLBINgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462821/NRP_NF_Ranking_Product_02.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook is testing a new method for hiding psots in the News Feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J57vnh"&gt;Facebook also says it will ask users what topics they are not interested in, like cooking, sports, or politics (the three types of people) so that it can show them other posts that are relevant to their interests. The company says it’s also testing an easier way to prune posts you might not want to see in your feed via a small “X” in the top-right corner of a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rd2Y1N"&gt;Neither of these changes sounds like they would actually help with Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270659/facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms"&gt;habit of radicalizing users&lt;/a&gt;. If anything,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;depending on how heavily News Feed weighs those answers, it could lead people further down whatever potentially dangerous rabbit holes they’re already exploring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsVFQd"&gt;While the plan seems vague, engaging with users over their News Feed likes and dislikes is broadly good. Facebook has long seemed focused on maintaining and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325355/facebook-growth-ai-go-read-this-ethics-misinformation-bias"&gt;increasing engagement&lt;/a&gt;, at the cost of providing people a healthy environment to talk to family and friends. This survey approach is a small step in the right direction, but it is dependent on people actually participating in the first place, which isn’t guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzDS8i"&gt;Despite this measure of progress, Facebook still seems slow and reluctant to make big positive changes on its platforms. The company made a drastic change to the News Feed after the US election, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612728/facebook-news-feed-us-election-change-mainstream-news-misinformation"&gt;boosting authoritative news sources&lt;/a&gt; but only temporarily. Relying on surveys and hiding its division problem rather than directly addressing it feel like steps back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47R2TD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tF3lQ1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MfJJru"&gt;Congressional Democrats have introduced a bill that would make it easier for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to warn people about unsafe products, by repealing part of a 49-year-old law that limits what information the agency can release publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4hbZZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Sunshine%20in%20Product%20Safety%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;The Sunshine in Product Safety Act (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; comes after reports that exercise machine company Peloton “obstructed CPSC’s investigation” into its Peloton Tread Plus treadmill, according to the members of Congress. The Tread Plus has been involved in some 39 accidents where children were injured, including one death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd5C6N"&gt;The CPSC “was unable to alert the public of the reported incidents related to children, pets, and objects getting pulled under the treadmill until a month later,” according to the congresspeople. “These incidents ranged from mild injury to broken limbs, brain damage, and even death. Some incidents also occurred while the treadmill was being operated and in use by an adult.” The CPSC had to “negotiate with Peloton over the wording and timing of the warning alert” due to Section 6(b).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gThV8StW8BaTg945qX-BEQK_9uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22463270/peloton_plus_treadmill.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Peloton Tread Plus treadmill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fKkteX"&gt;Section 6(b) of the &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/PageFiles/105435/cpsa.pdf?epslanguage=en"&gt;Consumer Product Safety Act (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; restricts what information the CPSC can disclose publicly if it receives a safety hazard report about a product or manufacturer. Congress amended Section 6(b) of the act in 1981, generally requiring the CPSC to keep information confidential unless the company involved has agreed otherwise, or if the two sides have worked out a settlement agreement. There’s an exception where the CPSC can release information if it can prove there is “substantial product hazard” for public health and safety, but a company can sue to prevent the CPSC from revealing information, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMC4wU"&gt;The Sunshine in Product Safety Act would get rid of Section 6(b) entirely if it became law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEt30n"&gt;The CPSC declined to comment Thursday. But CPSC Acting Chairman Robert Adler said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he ”strongly believes repealing section 6(b) would enable the CPSC to provide consumers more safety information, sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZdOpZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported last Friday that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;Peloton had resisted a request&lt;/a&gt; from the CPSC to recall the Tread Plus. The two sides were involved in negotiating over the wording of a warning to alert consumers of the potential dangers of the Tread Plus, and when to release the warning. Peloton did not provide the CPSC with personal information about the child killed in an incident with a Tread Plus — it claims the child’s family asked it not to — until the CPSC presented it with a subpoena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CVuZNS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the treadmills “pose serious risks to children,” according to the CPSC &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhWTS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;Peloton said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the agency “unfairly characterized Peloton’s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC’s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth.” The CPSC, Peloton claims, was “unwilling to engage in any meaningful discussions with Peloton before issuing its inaccurate and misleading press release.” The company told the&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt; that it did not believe a recall of the treadmill was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qHhQF"&gt;On Saturday, the CPSC finally &lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread+"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about Peloton Tread Plus treadmills, saying the machines pose “serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.” Peloton CEO John Foley had said in a March blog post that the company &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;was aware&lt;/a&gt; that a child had died in an accident on the treadmill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBePUI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y&amp;amp;ab_channel=U.S.ConsumerProductSafetyCommission"&gt;The CPSC also posted a video&lt;/a&gt; (please be advised the video is disturbing) showing what could happen in a Tread Plus accident, showing security camera footage of a child being pulled under the treadmill and nearly crushed before he is able to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9yzbK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389301/cpsc-treadmill-peloton-children-risk-injury"&gt;The agency urged consumers with children at home&lt;/a&gt; to stop using the Tread Plus immediately, due to “multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under the rear roller of the product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czUbx1"&gt;“CPSC must be able to move swiftly to warn Americans when products like the Peloton Tread+ and the Fisher-Price Rock ’n Play Sleeper pose a danger to them and their families,” reads a statement from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). “Yet current regulatory constraints allow companies to call the shots on how and when to notify the public about their hazardous products, keeping important safety information from the public.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdwPVn"&gt;The Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play that Blumenthal referenced was a recliner meant to soothe babies to sleep that was &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2019/fisher-price-recalls-rock-n-play-sleepers-due-to-reports-of-deaths"&gt;recalled in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-fisher-price-invented-a-popular-baby-sleeper-without-safety-tests-and-kept-it-on-the-market-even-as-babies-died/2019/05/30/78c2707a-7731-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html"&gt;30 reports of infant deaths&lt;/a&gt;. Blumenthal chairs the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s6UBh"&gt;Peloton did not reply to a request for comment Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1D5HtO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 22nd 5:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Acting CPSC Chairman Robert Adler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University of Minnesota banned from contributing to Linux kernel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kcHO5ryFdC0jjc1aG-EleiMh34g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69171940/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LpXTUS"&gt;The University of Minnesota &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/"&gt;has been banned&lt;/a&gt; from contributing to the Linux kernel by one of its maintainers after researchers from the school apparently knowingly submitted code with security flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1g4Or"&gt;Earlier this year, two researchers from the university &lt;a href="https://github.com/QiushiWu/QiushiWu.github.io/blob/main/papers/OpenSourceInsecurity.pdf"&gt;released a paper&lt;/a&gt; detailing how they had submitted known security vulnerabilities to the Linux kernel in order to show how potentially malicious code could get through the approval process. Now, after another student from the university submitted code that reportedly does nothing, kernel maintainer and Linux Foundation fellow Greg Kroah-Hartman has &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; calling for all kernel maintainers to reject any code submissions from anyone using a umn.edu email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sclXfM"&gt;In addition to not accepting any new code from the university, all of the code submitted in the past is being removed and re-reviewed. It seems like it will be a massive amount of work, but Kroah-Hartman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregkh/status/1384785747874656257?s=20"&gt;has made it clear&lt;/a&gt; that the developer community doesn’t appreciate “being experimented on” and that all of the code from the university has been called into question due to the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KCLrGJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The possibility of bugs slipping through is well-known in the open-source software community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FK3TQq"&gt;The university has &lt;a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/statement-cse-linux-kernel-research-april-21-2021"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt;, saying it’s been made aware of the research and its subsequent ban from contributing. It says it has suspended that line of research and will be investigating how the study was approved and carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="598jsJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/clarifications-hc.pdf"&gt;a statement meant to clarify the study&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said they intended to bring attention to issues with the submission process — mainly, the fact that bugs, including ones that were potentially maliciously crafted, could slip through. Kernel developer Laura Abbot countered this &lt;a href="https://www.labbott.name/blog/2021/04/21/breakingtrust.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the possibility of bugs slipping through is well-known in the open-source software community. In &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnX@kroah.com/"&gt;what appears to be a private message&lt;/a&gt;, the person who submitted the reportedly nonfunctional code called Kroah-Hartman’s &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH5%2Fi7OvsjSmqADv@kroah.com/"&gt;accusations&lt;/a&gt; that the code was known to be invalid “wild” and “bordering on slander.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk5n13"&gt;It’s unclear if that submission — &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20210407001658.2208535-1-pakki001@umn.edu/"&gt;which kicked off the current controversy&lt;/a&gt; — was actually part of a research project. The person who submitted it did so with their umn.edu email address, while the patches submitted in the study were done through random Gmail addresses, and &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnX@kroah.com/"&gt;the submitter claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the faulty code was created by a tool. Kroah-Hartman’s response basically said that he found it unlikely that a tool had created the code, and, given the research, he couldn’t trust that the patch was made in good faith either way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POHNdp"&gt;There’s been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1384877167247511552?s=20"&gt;criticism from some in the open-source community&lt;/a&gt;, saying that Kroah-Hartman deciding to pull any patches submitted by U of M personal is an overreaction, which &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-bans-university-of-minnesota-for-committing-malicious-code/"&gt;could lead to bugs fixed by legitimate patches&lt;/a&gt; being reintroduced. It is worth noting, however, that &lt;a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/"&gt;the plan&lt;/a&gt; is to re-review the patches and to resubmit them if they’re found to be valid. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat now has more users on Android than iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4rkrGQ1WRFN1X8C7_5De7qjUxY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69171930/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iibYMU"&gt;Snap has finally reaped the benefits of building a fully functional Android app. The company &lt;a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Earnings-Slides-Final-4.22.21.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in its earnings report today that its user base mostly uses Android instead of iOS. That overall user base continues to grow, too. During the first quarter of 2021, Snapchat reached 280 million daily active users, an increase of 22 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uqCPD"&gt;CEO Evan Spiegel called the moment Android users overtook iOS users a “critical milestone that reflects the long-term value of the investment we made to rebuild our Android application,” in his prepared remarks today. As a reminder, Snapchat originally launched only on iOS and released its first Android app in 2012. The team later spent over a year rebuilding the app to bring it up to par with its iOS counterpart. As the Android app languished, Snapchat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18024762/snapchat-android-users-loss-q3-2018-earnings"&gt;bled Android users&lt;/a&gt;. It finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/8/18300720/snapchat-android-app-rebuilt-release-speed-bugs-features"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; the final version of that app in 2019, making the app more functional and accessible to global users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxahWJ"&gt;The company says its growth has also fueled it to invest in content abroad. Spiegel highlighted a Snap Original show the company launched in India in March, as well as its efforts to improve language support and feature localization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7ismQ"&gt;Interestingly, new social apps, like Clubhouse in particular, continue to launch on iOS at first, sacrificing the potential Android market locally and abroad. If there’s anything to take away from Snap’s earnings this quarter, it’s not to sleep on Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch chat is getting threaded replies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyOeRCWCtzv53RnBcOsyJl77Ty0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69171825/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kojdoV"&gt;Twitch users will be able to make threaded replies in Twitch chat starting today, the popular streaming platform announced. Threaded replies could make it a lot easier to have side conversations within Twitch chats, which are sometimes chaotic waterfalls of text with no easy way to tell who might be talking to another. Twitch is calling the new feature Chat Replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDqw9F"&gt;To start a threaded reply, just hover over a message, click the arrow that will appear, and then type your message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tV4iPy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Chat Replies help you keep the conversation going, even when chat is going off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try out new message threads, keyboard shortcuts and more, now available to all communities on Twitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/jwrAkCYUU6"&gt;https://t.co/jwrAkCYUU6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DTPr2EFnCB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DTPr2EFnCB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1385337755052425216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nnkGug"&gt;Twitch first launched threaded replies as a 30-day experiment to 50 percent of channels in August 2020, so you may have seen something like it during your travels around the site at the time. In response to that experiment, Twitch is including a few new features with the full release, such as the ability to customize how you want replies to appear in your chat window and keyboard shortcuts. Though chaotic, Twitch chat is a big art of how streamers build communities on the site, so any improvement to it could lead to more vibrant connections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>College student sues Proctorio after source code copyright claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Before Baccalaureate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Www6qWwd0MmN3hSdPzTwuHf7wU=/50x0:5950x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69169817/1232456637.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Marcus Brandt/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEg3w5"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company’s remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It’s the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzQ9k6"&gt;The lawsuit intends to address the company’s behavior toward Johnson in September of last year. After Johnson found out that he’d need to use the software for two of his classes, Johnson dug into the source code of Proctorio’s Chrome extension and made a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443"&gt;lengthy Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; criticizing its practices — including links to excerpts of the source code, which he’d posted on Pastebin. Proctorio CEO Mike Olsen sent Johnson a direct message on Twitter requesting that he remove the code from Pastebin, according to screenshots viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. After Johnson refused, Proctorio filed a copyright takedown notice, and three of the tweets were removed. (They were reinstated after &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on the controversy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sK8Nb1"&gt;In its lawsuit, the EFF is arguing that Johnson made fair use of Proctorio’s code and that the company’s takedown “interfered with Johnson’s First Amendment right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgOb4R"&gt;“Copyright holders should be held liable when they falsely accuse their critics of copyright infringement, especially when the goal is plainly to intimidate and undermine them,” said EFF Staff Attorney Cara Gagliano &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-proctorio-behalf-student-it-falsely-accused-copyright-infringement-get"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7SqdE"&gt;“I’m doing this to stand up against student surveillance, as well as abuses of copyright law,” Johnson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This isn’t the first, and won’t be the last time a company abuses copyright law to try and make criticism more difficult. If nobody calls out this abuse of power now, it’ll just keep happening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nj7LRO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254631/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-proctorio-online-test-proctoring-privacy"},{"title":"An ed-tech specialist spoke out about remote testing software — and now he’s being sued ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9pKcoR"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that schools use to watch for cheating on remote tests. Its use exploded last year with the rise of remote learning; the platform proctored over 16 million exams. The software records students through their webcams as they work and monitors the position of their heads while they take exams. It flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. It also enables instructors to track the websites students visit during the exam period and to bar them from functions like copying and pasting text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etbshw"&gt;Students and instructors around the country have volleyed numerous criticisms against Proctorio, claiming it violates student privacy and has the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374386/proctorio-racial-bias-issues-opencv-facial-detection-schools-tests-remote-learning"&gt;discriminate&lt;/a&gt; against marginalized students.

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ), cited similar concerns about Proctorio in an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IrTuL"&gt;Proctorio has engaged critics in court before, although more often as a plaintiff. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Last October&lt;/a&gt;, the company sued a technology specialist at the University of British Columbia who made a series of tweets criticizing the platform. The thread contained links to unlisted YouTube videos, which Proctorio claimed contained confidential information. The lawsuit drew ire from the global education community: hundreds of university faculty, staff, administrators, and students have signed an &lt;a href="https://blog.communityofpraxis.ca/2020/09/03/in-defence-of-ian-linkletter/"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; in the specialist’s defense, and a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-against-proctorio"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; for his legal expenses has raised $60,000 from over 700 donors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgbqJ1"&gt;“We disagree that sharing confidential information is the same thing as criticism,” Olsen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;at the time. “Posting these kinds of things...it risks students learning how to circumvent the software, and it risks the safety and security of millions of students who use the software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXDX7n"&gt;Proctorio did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the EFF’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmuRhy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 22nd, 3:46PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Erik Johnson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s third crewed mission to the ISS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tIviU0RLZsBKAKAFw9yl-Ndvhg8=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69171211/51130235765_cc815b0c41_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;(NASA/Joel Kowsky)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HXRZ6P"&gt;SpaceX is slated to launch its third crew to the International Space Station early Friday morning, ferrying two astronauts from NASA, one from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the first European Space Agency astronaut to fly a private US spacecraft to orbit. The four-person crew will launch atop SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket at 5:49AM ET on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuHIpk"&gt;The mission, dubbed Crew-2, marks the second operational mission under the Commercial Crew Program, NASA’s public-private initiative to revive its human spaceflight capabilities after a 10-year dependence on Russian rockets. It will mark the first time NASA astronauts fly a reused crew capsule — Crew-2’s ride first flew in May 2020 as SpaceX’s first astronaut mission, carrying Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BW7ogz"&gt;The crew includes NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough, the mission’s spacecraft commander, and Megan McArthur, serving as the pilot. JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet, a French aerospace engineer, will serve as mission specialists. All the astronauts are in Florida ahead of the launch, and they’ll wake up at 11:09PM ET Thursday to prepare for flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Imq9V"&gt;NASA’s live coverage of the mission will begin hours before liftoff, at 1:30AM ET Friday. Liftoff is at 5:49AM ET. The trek to the International Space Station will take a little less than a day — the crew is scheduled to dock with the space station at around 5:10AM ET Saturday, April 24th. They’ll spend six months on the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BFPCCc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TIME IS SPACEX’S CREW-2 LAUNCH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czmgig"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will take off on Friday, April 23rd, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWQqcV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled launch time:&lt;/strong&gt; New York: 5:49AM / San Francisco: 2:49AM / London: 10:49AM / Berlin: 11:49AM / Moscow: 12:49PM / New Delhi: 3:19 PM / Beijing: 5:49PM / Tokyo: 6:49PM / Melbourne: 7:49PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QcT0EO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO WATCH SPACEX’S CREW DRAGON LAUNCH LIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NLS82h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live stream:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA’s live stream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWn6N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTdJ86"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys4RyX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYJj59"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
