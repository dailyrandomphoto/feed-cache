    <title>The Chevy Bolt recall is burning up what’s left of GM’s EV good will</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2df0OL"&gt;General Motors plans to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536601/gm-ev-investment-increase-amount-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;30 new electric vehicles around the world by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and aspires to sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;. But over the last few years, the United States’ biggest automaker has once again squandered the advantages it held in the still-burgeoning field of electric vehicles through bad politics, bad investments, and now most notably, a massive recall of the Bolt — currently its only all-electric vehicle — thanks to around a dozen reported fires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxVzPj"&gt;On Thursday, GM announced that it is extending the Bolt’s production shutdown until mid-October, as it apparently hasn’t been able to get supplier LG to produce replacement batteries that are up to snuff. It will need a lot of them, too, as GM has recalled all Bolts made to date — nearly 150,000. (The company says some vehicles will only need certain modules replaced, while others will get the whole battery pack swapped.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sy4adJ"&gt;In the meantime, GM gave Bolt owners something else to worry about this week, as it advised them to park at least 50 feet away from other vehicles. That’s in addition to the previous guidance owners have received, including parking away from their homes, not charging overnight, not charging above 90 percent, or letting their vehicle’s battery drain below around 70 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kQVCEe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM’s early push into electric vehicles is looking more like a false start&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4PNBN"&gt;All of this has made owning a Bolt a stressful and confusing affair, despite the apparently low odds of a fire. Some owners have tried to get GM to buy back their Bolts — which the company &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/40825/gm-is-buying-back-dozens-of-chevy-bolt-evs-that-pose-fire-risk-due-to-rare-manufacturing-defect"&gt;has done in some cases&lt;/a&gt; — only &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/09/11/chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-risk/5683333001/"&gt;to be rejected&lt;/a&gt;. Updates from the company have been intermittent since the initial recall in November 2020. It took until May 2021 for the automaker to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;announce its first attempted fix&lt;/a&gt; for the problem (which wound up not working), and it wasn’t until July of that year that GM finally admitted what the problem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;was in the first place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvR6gz"&gt;“This has been a very complex recall, but we’ve been moving as quickly as possible to provide our customers with information as we learned new developments alongside our supplier, LG,” Kevin Kelly, who leads Chevy’s PR team, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “We understand and can certainly appreciate the frustration that our Bolt EV owners have experienced over the past few months, but we’re committed to doing the right thing for our customers and we know we have to get the recall repair right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fi4Oo"&gt;“We continue to make progress and will work as quickly possible and inform owners when we have new information to share,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tndxGJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Bolt has been one of the most competent, capable, and affordable EVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SEC1w0"&gt;The Bolt, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/13/12899752/chevy-bolt-driving-impressions-review"&gt;launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, was supposed to help GM accomplish two things: set up GM as the first automaker to match Tesla with a mass-market, long-range electric vehicle, and also help everyone forget GM had once briefly led in this category with the EV1 — before it so thoroughly gave up on its fledgling electric car that it literally crushed most of the &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131994_report-with-ev1-gm-sparked-the-era-of-the-electric-car-but-didn-t-follow-through"&gt;remaining units to pieces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVQoKl"&gt;For a while, it worked. The Bolt never did gangbusters but has been one of the most competent, capable, and affordable electric cars on the market across the last half-decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7ixWs"&gt;But while GM was making modest progress on the road, it started working against that progress in Washington. When Donald Trump became president, GM was first in line with its Detroit peers when the White House opened for business. Just days after his inauguration, they &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/business/detroit-automakers-emissions-standards.html"&gt;reportedly lobbied the president to loosen&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Obama-era clean car standards&lt;/a&gt; so it would be easier to sell more profitable (but more harmful) SUVs and pickup trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBO2BW"&gt;Trump took that inch and stretched it a country mile. His administration spent the next few years slapping together a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;spiteful but shoddy attempt&lt;/a&gt; at a far more drastic rollback of one of his predecessor’s crowning climate achievements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fxiXFz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM then spent time and money encouraging Trump’s deregulatory tendencies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmSCPJ"&gt;Some of those automakers, like Ford, eventually wised up and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;struck a compromise deal with California regulators&lt;/a&gt;, as the legal objections mounted to Trump’s decision. But GM doubled down by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;joining the Trump administration’s defense&lt;/a&gt;, and only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;abandoned that position after Trump lost reelection&lt;/a&gt;. The company maintains it only sided with the Trump administration because it shared the belief that the federal government should have the sole right to set national standards for emissions or fuel economy, though California had a waiver to the Clean Air Act that said otherwise (which Trump fought to to revoke). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVgxwA"&gt;While GM was risking its reputation for the sake of constitutional posturing, it started making similarly questionable moves with its checkbook. First, it &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/gm-wanted-too-much-from-ev-start-up-rivian-opening-door-for-ford.html"&gt;threw its weight around&lt;/a&gt; with buzzy EV startup Rivian. GM wanted exclusive rights to the technology that would power Rivian’s electric pickup truck and SUV in exchange for a sizable investment. Rivian politely declined and then immediately went on to raise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; from the likes of Ford and Amazon on its way to an IPO that could see its value skyrocket to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644601/rivian-ipo-november-december-filing-amazon-ford"&gt;nearly $100 billion&lt;/a&gt; — all without an exclusive deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUYosf"&gt;Then, under intense public pressure from the Trump administration, GM sold a recently-closed plant in Lordstown, Ohio to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;a brand new electric pickup truck startup&lt;/a&gt; called Lordstown Motors run by a guy who had recently left his post in charge of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;another unproven EV startup&lt;/a&gt; called Workhorse. GM also took a small stake in Lordstown Motors and participated in the investment portion of the startup’s merger with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;. GM even had the right to name a board member as part of that deal, but ultimately declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="PsawDU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spurned by Rivian, GM turned its attention to two far shakier startups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dF3zyP"&gt;Shortly after that, GM announced a deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;hydrogen electric trucking startup Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, which had a pickup truck project of its own. But that soured quickly after Nikola’s founder and now former CEO was accused of (and later &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/us-prosecutors-charge-trevor-milton-founder-of-electric-carmaker-nikola-with-three-counts-of-fraud.html"&gt;indicted for&lt;/a&gt;) allegedly lying about a lot of what Nikola was capable of in late 2020. GM abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;backed out&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the Lordstown Motors founder faced similar allegations and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;was eventually pushed out&lt;/a&gt;. GM still holds a small stake in Lordstown Motors, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgiBBC"&gt;GM is already back in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;good graces of the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;. And in a few years, with electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22362072/hummer-suv-electric-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Hummers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370058/gm-chevy-electric-silverado-pickup-truck"&gt;Silverados&lt;/a&gt; cruising the roads powered by the company’s next-generation battery pack, few will remember the company‘s involvement in two sketchy startups, or recall the automaker’s failed attempt at corralling one of the hottest electric vehicle companies to come to market of our time. After all, these were the kinds of metaphorical fires that tend to be easier to extinguish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6QFN1n"&gt;The problems with the Bolt, however, could cast a lasting pall — because this time the flames are real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2NmkT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFSfE6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surface Pro 8 leaks with 120Hz display and Thunderbolt support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rYKK1ThfPq19mcYBiJZixfbIyUw=/1x0:952x634/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69879036/surfacepro8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked image of the Surface Pro 8.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shadow_Leak (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Shadow_Leak/status/1439546343190638597" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8pvjpq"&gt;Microsoft is preparing to launch a new Surface Pro 8 model next week, and a leak appears to have revealed exactly what to expect. Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shadow_Leak/status/1439546343190638597"&gt;Shadow_Leak&lt;/a&gt; has published a photo of the Surface Pro 8 from what appears to be a retail listing. The account claims the Surface Pro 8 will ship with a new 13-inch 120Hz display with narrow bezels and two Thunderbolt ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxwJCH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that the Surface Pro 8 would ship without USB-A ports, in favor of USB-C and Thunderbolt. We also reported that Microsoft has been testing 120Hz displays for the Surface Pro lineup. The leaked image and specs line up with what we’ve heard from sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qfgd9i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft Surface Pro 8 Exposure ✅&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Intel's 11th-generation Core processor&lt;br&gt;- 13" 120Hz High Refresh Rate Narrow Border Screen&lt;br&gt;- Windows 11&lt;br&gt;- Dual Thunderbolt Interfaces&lt;br&gt;- Replaceable SSD Hard Drives&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Microsoft?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Surface?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Surface&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SurfacePro8?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SurfacePro8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ITFftYG4dg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ITFftYG4dg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sam (@Shadow_Leak) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shadow_Leak/status/1439546343190638597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qv43RR"&gt;The leak also reveals Microsoft is moving to removable SSDs on the Surface Pro 8. That matches the Surface Laptop 4 and Surface Pro X, and will make it easier for businesses to swap out drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxB7pV"&gt;Microsoft is holding a Surface hardware event on September 22nd, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;where we’re expecting&lt;/a&gt; the company to announce the Surface Pro 8, a Surface Go 3, a newly designed Surface Book 4, an updated Surface Pro X, and the successor to the Android-powered Surface Duo. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for all the Surface news on September 22nd, from 11AM ET / 8AM PT onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok parent ByteDance adds time limit for kids under 14 on its video app in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin App As TikTok Owner Challenges Alibaba in E-Commerce Ahead of IPO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSDRXJHH_PtyDeh2Q4wGTeQG_vQ=/0x2:5000x3335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69878967/1232774217.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok is branded under the name Douyin in China | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="95SQfz"&gt;The Chinese version of the popular short video app TikTok, known as Douyin, will limit users in China who are under 14 years old to 40 minutes a day, parent company ByteDance &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zp43DhzwanDApoPCIgCvJQ"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgAF2a"&gt;The app’s youth mode keeps it in line with the Chinese government’s new restrictions on access to video games for younger children. Teens under 14 will be able to access Douyin between 6AM and 10PM, but won’t be able to use the app outside of that window, the company said. The rules will apply to “real-name authenticated users” under 14, and the company encouraged parents to help their children complete the real-name authentication process, or activate youth mode when prompted by the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwtNuw"&gt;The Chinese government has been focused on reducing the amount of time Chinese teenagers spend online, which it views as harmful. Last month, its National Press and Publication Administration &lt;a href="http://www.nppa.gov.cn/nppa/contents/279/98792.shtml"&gt;unveiled new rules&lt;/a&gt;, which restrict Chinese citizens under 18 to playing online games only on Fridays, weekends, and holidays, between 8PM and 9PM. Authorities have directed game companies and platforms like Douyin to use real-name identification for all its users; the process requires users to provide a phone number and other identification to access online games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EAY9b"&gt;ByteDance said the content available to users in youth mode will now include educational material like “interesting popular science experiments, exhibitions in museums and galleries, beautiful scenery across the country, explanations of historical knowledge, and so on.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK2aau"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytkzMP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Inspiration4 crew returns to Earth, capping first fully private mission in orbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cap0AEYGZiakNh0FIJapP1iU1a8=/0x2:1616x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69877476/d68946e2_535a_4075_8e3d_8b5f8c249199_image001.10.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://inspiration4.com/press/kennedy-space-center-fl-september-18-2021--after" target="_blank"&gt;Inspiration4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ib5BBw"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule carrying four private citizens plunged through Earth’s atmosphere Saturday night and splashed down off the east coast of Florida, closing out the company’s first all-civilian mission in space. The Inspiration4 crew — the mission’s billionaire funder Jared Isaacman, geoscientist Sian Proctor, physician assistant Haley Arceneaux, and data engineer Chris Sembroski — became the first crew to hang out in Earth orbit without any professionally trained astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VuAZaL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it was a heck of a ride”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GctaKG"&gt;The crew’s splashdown zone in the Atlantic Ocean was roughly 30 miles east of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, where they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;launched to space&lt;/a&gt; atop SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket on Wednesday. Beginning at about 7:02PM ET, Crew Dragon deployed two sets of parachutes — an initial set of two, and a final set of four — to ease its descent toward the ocean. Splashdown happened at around 7:06PM ET. SpaceX recovery teams raced toward the capsule in boats to retrieve the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaZXoi"&gt;“Thanks so much SpaceX, it was a heck of a ride for us, and we’re just getting started” Isaacman told SpaceX’s mission control just after splashing down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H8ggq9abnGYMjp8zFwg98jxZ2dU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22860807/Sep_18_2021_19_12_46.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Crew Dragon, carrying four passengers, splashes down in the Atlantic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BGp4nL"&gt;From an on-time launch at 8:02PM ET Wednesday to an on-time splashdown Saturday, the Inspiration4 mission lasted 71 hours total. The objectives of the orbital trek were two-fold: to raise $200 million for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a non-profit that researchers cancer and gives free care to kids with cancer and other life-threatening diseases, and conduct a scientific study on how the passengers’ bodies react to microgravity. Since launching on Wednesday, St. Jude raised roughly $20 million, putting the total fundraiser at about $153 million of its $200 million goal, St. Jude said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKjhUW"&gt;With the amateur crew strapped inside, SpaceX’s Crew Dragon began its fully autonomous reentry process at around 6:11PM ET, when it ditched its trunk and fired a set of thrusters to lower itself out of orbit and toward Earth’s atmosphere. A live video feed from inside the capsule showed Sembroski taking advantage of some in-flight entertainment — a movie was playing on an iPad strapped to his knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfknUm"&gt;The crew’s journey back to Earth appeared uneventful. They went through an expected, roughly seven-minute communications blackout with SpaceX’s mission control in California due to the sheath of plasma that forms around the capsule during its turbulent atmospheric reentry. During reentry, the exterior of the spacecraft reached temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, but the crew was kept cool by their flight suits and reinforced air conditioning inside the capsule. Crew Dragon streaked across the skies above northeast South America and zoomed toward the Cape Canaveral coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cXHAE"&gt;An initial set of two parachutes deployed as planned, slowing the capsule from 350 miles per hour to 100MPH. Those parachutes were ditched less than a minute later at an altitude of nearly 1,800ft and replaced by another deployment of four main parachutes, which worked to slow the spacecraft down to about 15MPH at splashdown.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Crew Dragon is lifted from the water and placed in its “Dragon nest” — a small pad on SpaceX’s recovery vessel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3YQPG"&gt;The capsule was hoisted out of the water and onto SpaceX’s “Go Searcher” boat roughly a half hour after splashing down. After that, recovery teams opened Crew Dragon’s hatch door and guided the crew out on a platform one by one, Arceneaux leading the pack. Proctor was next, practically grooving her way onto the platform. Sembroski and Isaacman followed. Isaacman’s egress was more of a toddle, his legs shaking a bit as he adjusted to Earth’s gravity. They’ll all get checked out by medical personnel and flown in a helicopter back to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcFNp9"&gt;The crew was in high spirits after stepping out of Crew Dragon, Inspiration4 mission director Scott Poteet told reporters during a post-splashdown press conference. “They’re taking selfies, they’re having a good time, they’re eating, they’re drinking, standing up and walking around.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QfqfLlsilh-f3xZ97bcmg3Naz60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22860872/Sep_18_2021_20_05_50.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Proctor walks out&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ePxcZ0"&gt;For the crew’s three-day trip in orbit, roughly 363 miles high, they video chatted with St. Jude patients, rang the bell on the New York Stock Exchange, and kept in touch with friends and family. Isaacman placed a $4,000 bet to Las Vegas that the Eagles would win the Super Bowl, and at another point, remotely chatted with Tom Cruise. They put on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680152/spacex-inspiration4-first-private-crew-update-in-orbit"&gt;a brief talent show on Friday&lt;/a&gt; in a livestream update — Sembroski jammed on a ukulele, Proctor showed off a drawing she made using a pack of metallic pens, and Arceneaux did somersaults in microgravity. “Hayley is a champ at spinning,” Proctor said as Arceneaux curled up in a ball and started tumbling in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH4vq2"&gt;The crew gathered data for a scientific study examining how microgravity affects the human body. During Friday’s video, Arceneaux showed off a device the crew was using to measure cranial pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txNd1O"&gt;The Crew Dragon capsule, named Resilience, was the same spacecraft that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt; sent a four-person crew of government astronauts to the International Space Station &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22413121/spacex-crew-dragon-resilience-splashdown-nasa-record-iss"&gt;and back&lt;/a&gt;. Few changes were made to the capsule besides a glass dome that was installed where the capsule’s docking door normally is, giving the passengers a 360-degree view of space while in orbit. The upper half of about three passengers could easily fit inside the dome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yaftA6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“very clean mission from start to finish”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8n2Q0L"&gt;Everything went nearly without a hitch, besides an issue with the capsule’s waste management system, or toilet. That was related to ”an issue with a fan that’s part of the system,” but it was quickly resolved, Inspiration4 mission director Todd Ericson said during a press conference. He did not offer additional details of the incident. Another issue during the mission involved a temperature sensor associated with one of Crew Dragon’s thrusters, but a backup sensor kicked in and worked fine, SpaceX’s director of crew mission management Benji Reed said. Overall, it was a “very clean mission from start to finish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ncjEz"&gt;Along with the mission’s official goals, Inspiration4 also showed that trips to orbit aren’t just for government astronauts anymore. Other missions will follow, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;first private mission to the ISS next year&lt;/a&gt;. The company that brokered that trip, Axiom Space, has already signed up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465134/spacex-axiom-space-sign-bulk-deal-private-crew-dragon-missions"&gt;three additional trips to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHRQF2"&gt;“Welcome to the second space age,” Ericson said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says Starlink internet service leaving beta in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Starlink dish pointing at the sky" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yiP41lZgGgcHxcZeOifR-NRR-zU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69877122/npatel_20210512_4552_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9nRkDP"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438748063527575555"&gt;tweeted Friday&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s Starlink satellite internet network would come out of its open beta phase next month. That’s two months later than the August date &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556031/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-users-next-year-telecom-5g"&gt;Musk gave at Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt;, when he also said he expected the service to have “possibly over 500,000 users within 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6N9On"&gt;The Starlink system calls for a constellation of nearly 12,000 satellites in low-Earth orbits that will beam continuous broadband internet service. A terminal costs $499 and there’s a $99 monthly fee for service. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;opened its public beta&lt;/a&gt; test in October 2020, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1429907171639103489?s=20"&gt;Musk said in August&lt;/a&gt; that SpaceX had shipped 100,000 Starlink terminals, which includes a satellite dish and a Wi-Fi router, to users in 14 countries. As the beta ends and more countries are able to get access to Starlink, that 100,000 number is likely to grow, although it’s hard to tell when it might reach the half-million mark that Musk predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37tpFT"&gt;Starlink’s internet service is planned to be sold directly to consumers in rural areas around the world, among other customers, and it’s touting 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds. Reviews of the Starlink service so far have been mixed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="90BfTO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Starlink review: broadband dreams fall to Earth","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Jm49aE"&gt;It’s also worth noting that Musk tends to be extremely optimistic when laying out deadlines for his companies’ product releases, as Tesla customers who waited for that company’s so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563751/tesla-elon-musk-full-self-driving-admission-autopilot-crash"&gt;“Full Self Driving” software&lt;/a&gt; can attest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson’s stunning vintage-inspired electric bikes are going on sale later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylbGEaWQIsmXszY92FPZ3OoWiQ0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876882/S1_Tribute_Front_Right.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zH6ULH"&gt;Nearly a year after announcing plans to spin out its own electric bike company called Serial 1, Harley-Davidson said it will sell a “limited” number of the gorgeous, vintage-inspired models that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;originally said was just a “styling exercise.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGjXts"&gt;The S1 Mosh/Tribute is an homage to &lt;a href="https://ultimatemotorcycling.com/2010/03/09/1903_harley-davidson_serial_number_one/"&gt;“Serial Number One,”&lt;/a&gt; the nickname for Harley-Davidson’s oldest known motorcycle built in 1903. The bike’s design, with its white tires, leather saddle and handgrips, and sleek black frame with gold lettering, harken back to that first prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMO0An"&gt;But under the glossy black paint and honey-colored leather accents, the bike is identical to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564315/harley-davidson-ebikes-serial-1-price-specs-date"&gt;Serial 1’s entry-level Mosh/Cty model&lt;/a&gt;. The S1 Mosh/Tribute (props to Harley for keeping all the vowels this time ) has many of the same features as the Mosh/Cty, including a Gates Carbon Drive belt, Brose mid-drive motor, TRP hydraulic disc brakes, internally routed cables and wires, and integrated lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="04zusU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the company is leaning into its motorcycle roots by relying on exclusives and one-offs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nSsEzd"&gt;The white-toned Schwalbe Super Moto-X tires are exclusive to Serial 1, and the leather saddle and matching leather grips are hand-made from Brooks England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkg2u7"&gt;It’s an update that’s sure to delight many potential customers who were initially disappointed when Harley-Davidson declined to say whether it would put the prototype into production back in October 2020. But it’s also an indication that the company is leaning into its motorcycle roots by relying on exclusive one-offs and limited runs as it tries to build a brand identity in what is turning out to be an incredibly crowded and competitive space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="STOlMs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10759201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrGOHj"&gt;Last month, the company announced a series of exclusive, one-of-a-kind e-bikes that it was auctioning off under its 1-OFF series brand name, with the Schwinn Sting-Ray-inspired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616558/harley-davidson-seral-1-electric-chopper-auction-specs"&gt;Mosh/Chopper as the first offering&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.serial1.com%2Fproduct%2Fmosh-chopper%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F18%2F22679256%2Fharley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-s1-mosh-tribute-exclusive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The winning bid was $14,200&lt;/a&gt;, which... wow.) At the time, the company said that much like in the motorcycle world, customization and personalization would play a big role in how Serial 1 thinks about the types of e-bikes it designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JettMu"&gt;The S1 Mosh/Tribute will serve as a “springboard to launch our S1 Series that will see even more exclusive and highly-desirable Serial 1 eBike models in the future,” product manager Aaron Frank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUrJY8"&gt;Harley-Davidson said it will only make 650 units, half of which will be available for purchase in the US, and the other half in Europe. Interested customers can pre-order one starting today on the company’s website, and deliveries are expected to commence in the fourth quarter of this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook VP disputes report claiming the platform knows about multiple flaws it doesn’t fix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OattcqRglK8jz1Iw9MxyVNDAOFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876762/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dc0VwI"&gt;Facebook’s vice president of global affairs criticized a series of stories by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; that reported the social network is aware of numerous problems across its platforms that cause harm to users, but does little to fix them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBJeWg"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/"&gt;post on Facebook’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Clegg wrote that while it was “absolutely legitimate for us to be held to account for how we deal with” some of the issues outlined in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporting, the stories “contained deliberate mischaracterizations of what we are trying to do, and conferred egregiously false motives to Facebook’s leadership and employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QY7VNv"&gt;This week, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; published a sweeping series of deeply reported stories on Facebook, based on its review of internal documents, concluding that the company’s platforms “are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO7wak"&gt;The stories included details about the XCheck program that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; found exempts celebrities from Facebook’s standard moderation rules; a look at internal research that shows its photo platform Instagram is problematic for younger users’ mental health; how changes Facebook made to its algorithm increased engagement but actually made users more angry; a look at employees’ concerns about how its platforms may be used in human trafficking, and how CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s initiative to promote COVID-19 vaccines drew anti-vax activists to flood Facebook with “barrier to vaccination” content. You can read the full &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files series here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsqHyr"&gt;Two Senators on the Commerce Committee panel that oversees consumer protection said they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;launching an investigation&lt;/a&gt; following the&lt;em&gt; Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; report that Facebook was aware that Instagram could be harmful to teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTi2SF"&gt;Clegg said in his blog post that the allegation that “Facebook conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings are inconvenient for the company” was incorrect. “[W]e fundamentally reject this mischaracterization of our work and impugning of the company’s motives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMBEuW"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clive Sinclair, inventor of the ZX Spectrum personal computer, has died</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Inventor and entrepreneur Sir Clive Sinclair has died at age 81.  | Photo by Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjr23M"&gt;Clive Sinclair, who invented the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, an early personal computer, died of cancer Thursday at age 81, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58587521"&gt;his family confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. Sinclair was an inventor with an impressive list of electronic products to his name, some, like his pocket calculator, were quite successful, while others, like his Sinclair C5 “electric trike” vehicle, were decidedly not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UISHI8"&gt;Born in England in 1940, Sinclair had a knack for creating gadgets. The Sinclair Executive “slimline” pocket calculator, released in 1972, sold well (likely in large part due to its low price ), and at one point was &lt;a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/2608"&gt;displayed at the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLoJXu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/workspace/pc/tales-tech-history-zx-spectrum-207004"&gt;Sinclair’s ZX personal computers&lt;/a&gt; were priced lower than the then-popular Commodore 64, and well-liked by consumers in the UK. The ZX Spectrum (nicknamed “Speccy”)  had a rubber keyboard and a color display, and eventually a library of thousands of games. The first model had 16KB of RAM and sold for £125 (roughly $170). The ZX Spectrum sold some 5 million units worldwide, before it was discontinued in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OLomJg"&gt;But even many of Sinclair’s less successful inventions were later validated; Sinclair’s Black Watch, which used “integrated circuit technology” according to a &lt;a href="https://rk.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/other/gallery/blackwatch_ukad.jpg"&gt;1970s print ad&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t really catch on, but looks it could have inspired some of the fitness trackers everyone wears on their wrists now. Sinclair’s TV80 pocket television wasn’t popular back in the day, but now we all carry little screens around with us wherever we go. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438623391645372420?"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted his condolences&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, saying he “loved” the ZX Spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSXse9"&gt;The Sinclair C5 electric vehicle, which launched in 1985 with a starting price of around  £399 (roughly $550) wasn’t a hit with consumers either; you had to pedal it when the battery died, and when seated the operator was below the line of sight of most cars on the road. Oh, and there was no passenger seat: the C5 was a one-person vehicle. It’s probably a stretch to call it a precursor to the Tesla, but Sinclair was on to something, perhaps just a few decades ahead of the general public.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ndUEgl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5N937V8ZOw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qnZwn8"&gt;“It was the ideas, the challenge, that he found exciting,” Sinclair’s daughter Belinda said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/16/home-computing-pioneer-sir-clive-sinclair-dies-aged-81"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “He’d come up with an idea and say, ‘There’s no point in asking if someone wants it, because they can’t imagine it.’” And doesn’t that last bit sound a lot like a sentiment often attributed to the late Steve Jobs, about why he didn’t rely on market research for product development: “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRpHG9"&gt;Despite receiving a knighthood in 1983 for his contributions to the UK’s computer industry, and being a pioneer in the field of consumer electronics, Sinclair preferred his slide rule to a calculator. He said he found the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/28/clive-sinclair-interview-simon-garfield"&gt;internet and email “annoying,”&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t use them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iHCpi"&gt;In addition to Belinda, Sinclair is survived by sons Crispin and Bartholomew, five grandchildren and two great grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV at Best Buy this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgS4pyfvxQNptZIAgXccbWC55JA=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876143/153092_tv_review_sony_a8_4k_oled_tv_review_image1_bgco4tcqtp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Slim and sharp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgcRHO"&gt;OLED TVs have developed a reputation for being sharp, clean, fragile, but also remarkably expensive. But this weekend you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzVgpkkUy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save a whopping $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; from Sony at Best Buy. At just 2.3-inches thick without its stand, the A8H, much like other OLED screens, is impossibly slim. This makes it ideal for wall mounting especially for anyone in pursuit of that ultra-clean, Ikea catalog aesthetic. In terms of apps, the A8H has access to the Android TV catalog and offers voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple AirPlay2. Besides having 4 HDMI ports that include a single audio return channel, the A8H also has a trio of USB ports and built-in Bluetooth for everything else.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5OkHSV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3arKN"&gt;One of our biggest issues with the Razer Nommo Pro when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17898382/razer-nommo-pro-review-consumers-producers-thx-dolby-stereo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;originally reviewed it in 2018&lt;/a&gt; was the overall cost, but this sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Pro-Certified-Illuminated/dp/B07DNSLL24?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon knocks more than $100 off the original MSRP&lt;/a&gt;, making it a far more attractive prospect. This THX-certified speaker system is one of the best ways to beef up your desktop audio without investing in a dedicated receiver. The system itself is composed of a pair of standing woofers and tweeters, a volume control knob, and a trashcan-sized subwoofer that serves as the hub that connects to your desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JcsGWP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758930"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BIFgP6"&gt;It’s tough to say no to a good pair of Beats, and right now you can grab a pair of the Beats Solo 3 Wireless in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo3-Wireless-Ear-Headphones/dp/B07YVYPNRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096%3Fpreselect%3D79358892%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $131, their second-best price to date. The well-built headphones are compatible with Android and iOS devices and can last for up to 40 hours on a single charge before needing to be topped off via MicroUSB. They sound decent enough, too, and pair effortlessly with iOS devices thanks to Apple’s integrated W1 chip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review in 2016&lt;/a&gt; took some issue with the original sticker price of the Solo 3 Wireless, but this sale definitely makes the on-ear headphones far more appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dTwSmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hjeuE"&gt;If your desktop or PS5 needs a little extra breathing room, right now you can grab the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-970-evo-plus-2tb%2Fp%2FN82E16820147744%3FItem%3DN82E16820147744" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung 970 EVO Plus (2TB) at Newegg for just $250&lt;/a&gt;. No bigger than a stick of gum, this SSD is one of the easiest ways to expand the storage outside of finally cleaning out your downloads folder.....the OTHER downloads folder. These drives can be easily installed on any motherboard with a free M.2 slot, and thanks to a recent firmware update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your PS5 as well&lt;/a&gt;. Besides providing you with more storage space, the faster transfer speeds can help cut down on load times for games as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3LG9e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5aDHQ"&gt;If you’re looking to substantially upgrade your home theatre and are okay with spending an equally substantial amount of money, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-HW-Q950A-11-1-4ch-Soundbar-Dolby/dp/B08X1CH646?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzRYNK7Tv#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have knocked $300 off the incredibly popular Samsung HW-Q950A Soundbar. We haven’t had a chance to test this ourselves, but a quick trip to Google will reveal a list of glowing reviews, from Wired, Reviewed, and Techradar to name a few. Even a cursory glance at this absolute lad of a soundbar reveals that that praise is well warranted. This soundbar includes 11 speakers as well as a pair of upward-firing rear speakers and a subwoofer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyT2OY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759046"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Castlevania composer on returning to her ‘masterpiece’ with new Apple Arcade game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="castlevania grimoire of souls" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JqJ97KkJ4nx4ubdYHf10GK6QjVI=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876046/15_5120x2880.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHFvMA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623498/apple-arcade-castlevania-grimoire-of-souls"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just the long-awaited return of the vampire-whipping series. It also marks the return of some big names, including character designer Ayami Kojima and composer Michiru Yamane, who left Konami in 2008. Yamane previously worked on seminal &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; games like &lt;em&gt;Symphony of the Night&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dawn of Sorrow&lt;/em&gt;, and after going freelance she teamed up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15830788/koji-igarashi-bloodstained-castlevania-interview-e3-2017"&gt;longtime &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; director Koji Igarashi&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102612/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review-switch-ps4-xbox-pc-castlevania"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodstained&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her credits also include &lt;em&gt;Skullgirls&lt;/em&gt;, a few &lt;em&gt;Suikoden&lt;/em&gt; games, and &lt;em&gt;Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, though she calls her work on &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; her “masterpiece.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLjVFr"&gt;Ahead of the launch of &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;, which is out now on Apple Arcade, I had the chance to ask Yamane a few questions over email about her work and career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r8ssJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it feel to return to the franchise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXZSmt"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; series is my masterpiece from my days as a company employee, and it is also the series in which I participated in the largest number of titles. So I’m very happy to be able to participate in this project as a freelance musician again after all these years, and to be able to please the fans of this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTaYIP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For you, what makes a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castlevania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; soundtrack distinct? What are elements that are intrinsically &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castlevania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rdn7AY"&gt;The best thing about it is its worldview. Pipe organs, choirs, church bells, and other instruments and musical styles which are typical of the medieval European era. In particular, baroque and classical music is of course a point of differentiation. In addition to the academic Western classical music, there is also the essence of various music such as Ravel and Debussy, the essence of avant-garde music, and modern music (progressive rock) in odd time signatures. For example, the desert stage contains music with Middle Eastern melodies, or the water stage uses modal melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zRxKT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The best thing about [Castlevania] is its worldview.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi6aW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think the series’ sound has evolved over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdUr4P"&gt;It can be said that it has developed along with changes in the performance of game console. The PSG sound source of NES, followed by the Mega Drive, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2, has increased the range of expression as time has progressed. In the early days of video games, the number of simultaneous sounds was three, but as technology increased, the amount of data that we can handle increased, and the range of musical expression expanded. We can say the same thing for graphics. As the person in charge of music, I feel that as the expression of graphics has expanded, it has become possible to express artistic beauty by linking it to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF0R4T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there anything you wanted to do differently this time around?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoG4sD"&gt;Currently, my life’s work is healing music. Because of this, I create music in a slightly lower tuning “A = 432hz,” which is specialized for healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvtCHV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
