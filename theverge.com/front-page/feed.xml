    <title>Playing with Hasbro’s ultimate toy, the $750 self-transforming Optimus Prime </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a real robot, with some real robot issues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lUkllq"&gt;Growing up, I thought my generation had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; toys: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmaFPA"&gt;Nerf blasters, laser tag, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18311479/nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary-switch-gaming"&gt;Game Boy&lt;/a&gt;, Legos in their prime, &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/super-soaker-oral-history"&gt;genuinely powerful&lt;/a&gt; Super Soakers, and of course, transforming action figures of all kinds. But I never did get into &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; proper, because the slow-to-convert toys felt tedious compared to the show. I wound up settling for simpler toys &lt;a href="http://www.virtualtoychest.com/k/keyforce/keyforce.html"&gt;like Key Force&lt;/a&gt;, all the while dreaming of the day Transformers could transform themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBE4nc"&gt;If you’ve got the money and a hard floor, that day may have finally arrived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPFCtL"&gt;For $750, &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/transformers-optimus-prime-auto-converting-programmable-robot-collectors-edition"&gt;Hasbro will now sell you&lt;/a&gt; a 19-inch-tall Optimus Prime robot that can literally unfold from a semi into a humanoid robot all by itself, and that’s just the start. Created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21057762/robosen-transformer-t9-robot-toy-ces-2020"&gt;by Robosen, a company that’s been building toward this moment for years&lt;/a&gt;, the new Optimus can pose; walk; dance; blast and slice; do push-ups; roll out and drive; even simulate breathing, all while delivering a wide array of original lines from Optimus Prime’s voice actor Peter Cullen himself. &lt;em&gt;It’s awesome&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e4Y-KnbjYIfIfQrm9ypEUuU_1Qw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433512/Apr_09_2021_17_13_10.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CShNQk"&gt;After several lengthy play sessions, I was ready to say it’s one of the coolest toys ever made — until my unit seemingly broke while running some final tests yesterday evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpoSLX"&gt;Before I get into that and some other major limitations, a warning: this toy may sell out, or already be sold out, while you continue to read. Hasbro says &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/transformers-optimus-prime-auto-converting-programmable-robot-collectors-edition"&gt;it’s available&lt;/a&gt; in “limited quantities” starting at 1PM ET today, the same time I published this story, and the company wouldn’t tell me how many that means. I know that’s not much help, but you should have until December, when the first units start to ship, if you decide to get one and later change your mind. (Those who pre-purchased one months ago should be getting them in November.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf4pgn"&gt;Another note: if you click &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4rk5ovyEh8s"&gt;links like this&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find I illustrate a lot of my upcoming points with video clips!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0Hn9zE2Zjk5U3URTIheRvPfNhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777052/shollister_210724_4708_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The red plate behind his head pops right off if you like, but you’ll want it on when he transforms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KXs02G"&gt;Touchy programmable motors in disguise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6wLY7y"&gt;The first thing you should probably understand about the “Transformers Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Robot” is that it’s more &lt;em&gt;robot&lt;/em&gt; than toy — and I mean a dumb, programmable robot, not the intelligent learning kind. Don’t expect a posable action figure you can leave perched on a shelf: it needs a constant flow of electricity to its 27 servo motors to keep itself from collapsing into a pile of robotic joints on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qquf8g"&gt;Don’t expect big action-y strides while walking, either: Optimus has &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/n4nZ2K42sVM"&gt;a remarkably dainty walk&lt;/a&gt; and has to shuffle his feet against the ground to turn, likely because his high center of gravity would make him tip over otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddjw9J"&gt;In fact, it’s such a balancing act that Optimus can’t even stand or walk if there’s the slightest amount of padding on your floor. My first hour with the leader of the Autobots was filled with disappointment as I tried carpet, rugs, mats, and the raised, grout-lined tiles of my kitchen floor &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/P_TJ7UQSDzo"&gt;only to watch Optimus flop on his face&lt;/a&gt;, or listen to constant “LEFT LEG IS STUCK, REBOOT TO RESTORE” alerts belching from the bot’s speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGWw8lmjs6QgRu76r-vBgg-pXfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780186/optimus_prime_exploded_view_robosen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Robosen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s inside Robosen’s Optimus Prime: lots of little black motor boxes, covered by panels and joints. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Epwpgj"&gt;Any time this happens, even if it’s just a wheel that could no longer turn after you drove into a pillow, you need to power off the entire system and start again. Simply repositioning the offending joint doesn’t help: if any of those 27 motors shuts down to protect itself, you’ll be interrupting play for 20 seconds to power down and power up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfEQZg"&gt;At six pounds, Optimus is also heavy enough that I’m wary of having it around younger kids. My four-year-old &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; watching and helping me play, but the bot doesn’t have any smarts to keep it from pinching fingers or toppling over if you bump into it. I even had a scare in the kitchen when the bot instantly powered off &lt;em&gt;and dropped like a stone&lt;/em&gt; when I stabbed a button in the iOS app too many times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr7gnH"&gt;While I’m talking rough edges, you’ll also want to temper your expectations around voice control: Google or Alexa this is not. While Hasbro makes it seem like you can just say, “Hey Optimus Prime” and begin shouting out a wide variety of commands, I found clearly enunciating even the very specific, well-defined phrases in the manual rarely worked, usually doing nothing at all — except the one that makes Optimus convert between semi and humanoid forms. Even then, you have to get the timing right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="h07V6F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmFoXh24Cjk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vleKg5"&gt;But the biggest issue I’ve had, of course, is the one that seems to have grounded my borrowed Optimus Prime for good. I don’t know if it was &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/P_TJ7UQSDzo"&gt;that last fall&lt;/a&gt; or what, but his entire hip joint motor no longer functions as of yesterday evening, and I haven’t had time to ship it back for inspection or even get an answer from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEavLb"&gt;I’m hoping it’s a fluke — because that very first day, when I took Optimus out to my concrete slab patio and stopped relying on voice, I couldn’t stop grinning at this awesome toy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G647Pp"&gt;More than meets the eye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BFYh0W"&gt;Watching a genuine robot Optimus Prime come to life, fire up headlights and taillights, roll out, stand up, flash his electric blue eyes and &lt;em&gt;visibly start breathing&lt;/em&gt; is an absolute trip. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1jRy4N-1loU"&gt;Delivering badass lines&lt;/a&gt;, dance poses, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ku51mDvYNnI"&gt;doing push-ups&lt;/a&gt;: hell yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXm94D"&gt;The high-density clamshell foam carrying case looks and feels great, as do his iconic ion blaster and fully translucent energon-axe — even if it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; weird Robosen &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LscrbNsz7xQ"&gt;chose to tack on machine gun sounds&lt;/a&gt; instead of ion blasts. There are loads of translucent and chromed-out details, too, and you can even flip open Optimus’s side mirrors and wrist communicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oBcyG8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10699627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDxep6"&gt;Originally, I expected the novelty would wear off after a few minutes, after I’d transformed back and forth a few times, listened to a dozen catchphrases and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Pe68vlnlidI"&gt;driven Optimus around&lt;/a&gt;. But after I got my first low battery warning after nearly two hours of play (a good showing for any R/C toy, much less one with 27 motors, lights and sound!), I was already ready to charge it back up and program some new moves myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJfbwF"&gt;Besides voice, there are four basic ways to play with Optimus using the iOS and Android app. First, there’s a limited, direct &lt;strong&gt;remote control&lt;/strong&gt; where you move a virtual joystick to drive or walk around, plus buttons to transform, honk, slice, shoot, or trigger a random “action.” There’s absolutely room for improvement here: the virtual joystick is pretty sloppy, driving’s a little jerky, and for some reason Optimus kept honking when I turned, but it’s a great way to show off a range of motion quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="VCxU2g"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GeJx3PtL0As?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PlHQ82"&gt;Or, you can fire a handful of&lt;strong&gt; actions&lt;/strong&gt; on command: dabbing, firing a series of punches, delivering a gesture-filled speech about freedom, or striking a hero pose, to name a few. You can unlock more actions, voice lines, and original &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; music by doing &lt;strong&gt;missions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4V2oH"&gt;Missions guide you through new poses in one of two ways: either an extremely simple block-based coding system where you drag and drop the desired rotation, speed, and timing for each joint you want to move (say, pulling an elbow, shoulder, and wrist slowly backward for a moment before you quickly pump a fist in the air) — or a method where you actually physically push each of Optimus’ joints into your desired position to create a pose, then build a whole sequence of those poses so Optimus can smoothly move between them. Then, you can freely switch over to the creator mode and build entirely new actions on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXlEFjN5xW7a_WUi8cuIZcnymOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780184/joint_lock_optimus_prime.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can “lock” and “unlock” joints one at a time to make it easier, but it takes a while.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bz0nwY"&gt;The software’s pretty cumbersome, and it can be a painstaking process — both in terms of holding all the bot’s joints upright in the position you want and the trial and error you’ll go through to see which movements Optimus can actually do without tipping. I spent 30 minutes trying to make Optimus stand on one leg, but I’m not entirely sure it’s possible to do that starting from a standing position — which the software&lt;em&gt; always&lt;/em&gt; assumes you will. In fact, there’s no way to program anything for Optimus Prime’s truck form, or make the wheels spin at all in those modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPX20p"&gt;And though the mobile app lets you unlock a USB mode, one where you can access the robot’s internal flash storage and theoretically program your own moves with an easier interface on PC, the company doesn’t have an app available for download yet and hasn’t answered questions about when one might arrive. I tried pulling one of the existing files into the Windows app that lets you program Robosen’s earlier T9 bot, but it immediately crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz6zOV"&gt;Yet, as frustrating as I’m making this sound, none of it killed my enthusiasm: before my unit broke, I was looking forward to programming some dance moves this weekend. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="eC77cX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Kj1-rrh_10?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cjopo1"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vIUe0D"&gt;I won’t be buying one of these. I can’t justify that $750 price tag, now that everyone knows the “it’ll teach my kids to program!” excuse isn’t sound. But I wonder if I’ll come to regret it, the same way I regret not snapping up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16234244/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-set-7541-pieces-800-dollars"&gt;an $800 Lego Ultimate Collector’s Edition Millennium Falcon&lt;/a&gt; when I had the chance — or if, perhaps, an even better version will come along that’s even truer to the ‘80s animated series, one that doesn’t have to turn around before it transforms and hopefully one with inertial sensors to balance itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfLFSg"&gt;I wouldn’t count it out because we now live in a golden era of glorious toys that kids could never afford: $2,200 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.segway.com%2Fsegway-ninebot-gokart-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F22623017%2Foptimus-prime-transformer-auto-converting-programmable-robot-hasbro-robosen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hoverboard go-karts&lt;/a&gt;, $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"&gt;3D-printed Nerf blasters&lt;/a&gt;, $160 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457616/spyra-two-water-gun-toy-pool-not-crowdfunded"&gt;self-pressurizing digital water guns&lt;/a&gt;, $400+ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;portable gaming PCs&lt;/a&gt;, $1,000+ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;self-flying cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235565/samsung-galaxy-fold-phone-status-symbol-price"&gt;folding phones&lt;/a&gt;, and one incredible &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; toy after another (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17464476/radio-flyer-lukes-landspeeder-toys-star-wars-play-test"&gt;Radio Flyer Landspeeder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535512/the-mandalorian-star-wars-hasbro-toy-ship-razor-crest-baby-yoda"&gt;Razor Crest ship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701781/star-wars-boba-fett-black-series-helmet-hasbro-costume-cosplay-toy-san-diego-comic-con-2019"&gt;Boba Fett helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;Mandalorian Nerf rifle&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p id="Dsz4kS"&gt;Heck, Lego has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fcategories%2Fadults-welcome&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F22623017%2Foptimus-prime-transformer-auto-converting-programmable-robot-hasbro-robosen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an entire Adults Welcome campaign&lt;/a&gt; now, highlighting an incredibly detailed line of expensive and oft-nostalgia infused sets like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345026/lego-space-shuttle-nasa-discovery-columbia-hubble-telescope"&gt;the $200 Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oKLYmS"&gt;My generation &lt;em&gt;still &lt;/em&gt;has the best toys, I’ve discovered, because they’re building them for us as adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX2GIX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade is getting a new Castlevania game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bI9eCXa-GFkTcZnrkrg8Qzu4fsE=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721901/15_5120x2880.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRo2hd"&gt;With the exception of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;an anime series on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, the last few years have been quiet when it comes to the gothic action series &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;. It looks like that’s about to change, though: developer Konami just announced a new game coming exclusively to Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z3fkCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFIiYt"&gt;The new title is called &lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s described as “an original side-scrolling action game that features a line-up of classic, well-loved characters from the series’ hit catalogue.” The graphics certainly look like a departure for the series, but there are some notable names on board, including character designer Ayami Kojima and composer Michiru Yamane, both of whom have contributed to the series since the iconic &lt;em&gt;Symphony of the Night&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t have a release date, but Apple says that it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ygusmb"&gt;If the name sounds familiar, it’s probably because Konami previously soft-launched a version of &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt; in Canada &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/09/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-release-date-closing-canada-ios-android-free/"&gt;before shutting it down last year&lt;/a&gt;. That iteration was free-to-play with added microtransactions, a feature that is absent from all Apple Arcade games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXzwRr"&gt;The news comes at a fairly busy time for Apple’s subscription games service. Today sees the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616888/fantasian-part-2-apple-arcade-release-date"&gt;part two of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a classic RPG from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585353/apple-arcade-tetris-beat-skate-city-tokyo-monster-hunter-stories"&gt;the music-focused &lt;em&gt;Tetris Beat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about a Snopes editor who plagiarized other news sites</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Snopes editor reportedly plagiarized other news sites | Image: Snopes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTmUnO"&gt;A startling new &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/snopes-cofounder-plagiarism-mikkelson"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that the co-founder of Snopes, a website known for fact-checking and debunking fake news items, was himself plagiarizing other news outlets under a phony byline, his own name, and a Snopes byline for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI21a7"&gt;According to BuzzFeed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="k38xyT"&gt;...between 2015 and 2019, [David] Mikkelson wrote and published dozens of articles containing material plagiarized from news outlets such as the Guardian and the LA Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GRSBhp"&gt;Snopes did an internal investigation, according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;’s report, and uncovered the plagiarized work, all of which it plans to retract. Snopes’ vice president of editorial Doreen Marchionni told BuzzFeed that plagiarism “had no place in any context within this organization.” The site’s editorial staff also disavowed Mikkelson’s behavior in a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/snopes-cofounder-plagiarism-mikkelson#statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCTjV0"&gt;Mikkelson, who has been suspended from “editorial duties” apologized in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/snopes-cofounder-plagiarism-mikkelson#mikkelson"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; of his own, telling &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; he was sorry for his “lapses in judgment.” According to emails that BuzzFeed viewed, however, Mikkelson had encouraged other writers at Snopes (without success it appears), to rewrite other outlets’ news articles to boost Snopes’ traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BI9j4r"&gt;Snopes has long been treated as a reliable verifier of information online, but what &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed &lt;/em&gt;has uncovered paints a devastating picture of one editor who used unethical practices to try to gain more credibility, and more online traffic, which may end up damaging the site’s reputation as well as his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah4dbY"&gt;Go read &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/snopes-cofounder-plagiarism-mikkelson"&gt;this excellent, thorough report&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; contributing writer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shootingthemess?lang=en"&gt;Dean Sterling Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who dug deep to debunk the debunker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter’s interoperable smart home standard has been delayed to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TnUleY-lT9vUrFyjMppnuo8w0-g=/249x0:1881x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721863/matter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LP3ApU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; — the upcoming smart home standard that looks to help unify Google, Apple, and Amazon’s separate smart home systems into a single cross-functional standard — has been delayed again to sometime in 2022, Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) CEO Tobin Richardson &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/news_and_articles/building-a-standard-that-really-matters/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeTOIq"&gt;While Matter itself has a “feature-complete specification,” the group still has to finish developing the SDK and the certification program by which developers will be able to get both existing and new hardware officially labeled as Matter-approved. While the original goal was to have much of that work done this year, with the first Matter-certified hardware rolling out by the end of 2021, the new timetable pushes that out to sometime vaguely in the first half of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q4DNSn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Matter is the new name of Project CHIP, the partnership that promises to simplify your smart home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ylgY2g"&gt;We still might see some Matter updates earlier in 2022 for existing products like Philips Hue (which has already pledged comprehensive support for the standard on its smart lights). According to &lt;a href="https://staceyoniot.com/does-it-matter-smart-home-standard-is-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;smart home expert Stacey Higginbotham&lt;/a&gt;, however, the delay means that the first new Matter-enabled devices likely won’t be out until the back half of 2022 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hP7vr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://staceyoniot.com/does-it-matter-smart-home-standard-is-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;As Higginbotham reports&lt;/a&gt;, Richardson explained the delay as being caused by several factors, including adding more companies to Matter, the new delta variant-fueled wave of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the simple fact that it's hard to develop a complicated, multi-device connectivity standard like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkqL5Y"&gt;It’s not the first delay for Matter, either, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;first announced &lt;/a&gt;in 2019 with the goal of a late 2020 release. That was shifted to a goal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427139/amazon-apple-google-zigbee-alliance-open-source-smart-home-standard-2021-launch"&gt;of a full launch sometime&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;delayed again to the end of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iCfhP"&gt;Given the number of players and complexity of building a system that unifies smart home products from not just Apple, Google, and Amazon but from over 200 different companies, it’s easy to understand why the Matter team is taking things slowly. But it also means that anyone hoping that the standard would help to simplify their smart home setup will have to wait a few more months (at a minimum) before things start to roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cL16us"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Nest Hubs will warn users about nearby pollution and smoke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Hosts Its Annual I/O Developers Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VAKbPDbBqa3uACAmHsopjPV9y48=/0x38:5160x3478/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721793/1147623879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Nest Hub Max is displayed during the 2019 Google I/O conference at Shoreline Amphitheatre on May 07, 2019 in Mountain View, California. | Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pxbl9f"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/googles-nest-hubs-will-start-showing-air-quality-metric-1847480834"&gt;adding air quality data&lt;/a&gt; to its Nest Hub smart displays. While the new feature is still only available in “select” US markets, it’ll give some users an idea of how much risk they might face from smoke and pollution in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kbiOIs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll give some users an idea of how much risk they might face&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9CIhd"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/thread/120800522/stay-in-the-know-about-the-air-around-you-on-your-nest-display?hl=en"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it will roll out the new feature “over the coming weeks.” An Air Quality Index badge will show up on the clock and weather widget on the Nest Hub’s Ambient screen. Anyone who doesn’t want to see the badge will be able to opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy5ha7"&gt;The data comes from the Environmental Protection Agency, which &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/"&gt;rates air quality&lt;/a&gt; on a scale from zero to 500, with zero being the best air quality. It also color-codes its ratings in categories ranging from “good” to “hazardous” air quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbO4UY"&gt;The EPA calculates risk by assessing five major pollutants: carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, smog, and particle pollution (which includes soot and smoke). Smoke from raging wildfires in the Western US has spread across the country over the past month. &lt;a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/07/21/officials-issue-air-quality-health-advisory-for-n-y-due-to-wildfires-in-california-canada/"&gt;New York state&lt;/a&gt; issued a health advisory in July when smoke arrived from the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPA Air Quality Index" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpSnWK23F20IPo5bbPHiLEryAtA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780748/aqitableforcourse.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EPA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EPA Air Quality Index&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vCth6h"&gt;In places where Google’s new air quality feature is available, Nest Hubs will issue an alert when pollution reaches an unhealthy level or a level that’s unhealthy for “sensitive groups.” The Nest Hub will also respond to the voice command, “What’s the air quality near me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow8Me7"&gt;The EPA’s air quality data is easy to access even if you don’t have a Nest Hub, or if its new features aren’t available in your area. The EPA’s &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/"&gt;AirNow website&lt;/a&gt; lets users plug in their location to get an air quality rating for that area. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/"&gt;EPA’s Fire and Smoke Map&lt;/a&gt;, which has pretty wild visualizations of how far wildfire smoke reaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="CvyA4E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doesn’t always pick up everything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NoRypJ"&gt;While the EPA has a network of thousands of air quality sensors across the nation, it doesn’t always pick up everything. The sensors are expensive to deploy and can be spread far apart from each other, so they can miss higher concentrations of pollution in some areas. Its monitors have also missed “major toxic releases” in the past when equipment failed or was out of operation, a &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21833693/air-quality-index-monitoring-epa-pollution-health-reuters"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6i3n0u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cheaper air quality sensors arrived just in time for the climate catastrophe ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21440343/air-quality-sensors-wildfire-smoke-pollution-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="ox7y59"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why wildfire smoke can be worse than other air pollutants ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22600224/wildfire-smoke-worse-air-pollution"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aNvVpq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Studios still need movie theaters, and they’re making the deals to prove it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zg6cSYA_m-r6JiPO-CsZOOTG4eM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721750/acastro_210813_1777_theater_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzKKDA"&gt;During the course of the pandemic, the future of movie theaters looked grim. Cinema owners teetered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248335/amc-bankruptcy-debt-movies-delay-streaming"&gt;edge of bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; amid ongoing closures and lockdown orders, and streaming services introduced new release models that made clawing back theatrical exclusivity even harder for already struggling exhibitors. Theaters appeared to be facing an existential crisis, close to being snuffed out by a world that no longer needed them for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MEAeX"&gt;But as cinemas have begun to reopen their doors and feature films finally make their silver screen debuts following prolonged delays, the story has started to change. In recent months, a number of studio owners have struck deals with exhibitors — including Regal parent &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/cineworld-regal-warner-bros-deal-theatrical-windows-us-cinemas-reopening-1234719255/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;Cineworld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/cinemark-theater-deals-vod-studios-1234968717/"&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618697/amc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; — to lock in exclusive theatrical releases. It’s a sign that even studios attached to major streaming services believe they still need theaters to make a major release a success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uXQuLK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s no secret that AMC was not at all happy” about films going straight to HBO Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xaOny"&gt;During an earnings call this week, AMC boss Adam Aron formally announced that the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618697/amc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max"&gt;reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Warner Bros. to release films exclusively in cinemas for 45 days beginning in 2022 — a shift away from WarnerMedia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;hybrid release model&lt;/a&gt; that saw all 2021 Warner Bros. films premiere in theaters and on HBO Max on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTTLuF"&gt;“It’s no secret that AMC was not at all happy when Warner decided in December to take movies to the home on HBO Max simultaneously with theatrical release,” Aron said. “Therefore, it’s especially gratifying that Warner is yet again embracing an exclusive theatrical window. And for us at AMC, it’s especially pleasing to be working so harmoniously with Warner Bros. once again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeCbjj"&gt;The deal patches up a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amc-is-pissed-1845804062"&gt;very public falling out&lt;/a&gt; between theater chains and studios last year that followed contentious announcements about streaming-exclusive releases for films that were intended to debut in theaters alone. The issue became so heated that at one point last year AMC said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240637/amc-theaters-universal-trolls-world-tour-disney-warnermedia-digital-streaming"&gt;ban Universal films&lt;/a&gt; from its theaters. Months later, they struck a deal for much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;narrower theatrical releases&lt;/a&gt;, and Aron this week said the two companies had the “best working relationship that we’ve had together in many years.” As for other moviemakers, Aron said that the theater chain was in discussion with every major studio about exclusive releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="B0b7xP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are hearing considerable support in Hollywood.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ja3jUo"&gt;“We are hearing considerable support in Hollywood that an exclusive theatrical window is an important way to build big and successful movie franchises,” Aron said. “Clearly, though, this whole subject is quite topical. It’s very much a work in progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94Lb7P"&gt;AMC has plenty of incentive to paint a copacetic picture of its post-pandemic future on a call with its shareholders, and theatrical exclusivity windows of 45, 31, or as little as 17 days — all of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;theaters have agreed to&lt;/a&gt; in this new pandemic-era environment — are a far cry from the 90-day windows that cinemas typically enjoyed pre-COVID. But negotiations for exclusive exhibition rights certainly indicate studios need these windows to help their films succeed, at least where big-budget releases like &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;, or the forthcoming James Bond film&lt;em&gt; No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt; are concerned, said Shawn Robbins, a chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdb4M7"&gt;“These are the types of films that Hollywood has relied on for decades, and they are the money makers,” Robbins told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by phone. “So from that perspective, having a film exclusively in theaters serves as a launching pad for that revenue stream for the studio while also serving, from the audience perspective, as a communal way to see these movies in a way that really isn’t duplicated in the home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wv7JgU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every business has to evolve and adapt to the times.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8t66kZ"&gt;Still, and perhaps most importantly, the pandemic has so transformed the traditional movie release structure that theaters will need to get creative with their long-term post-pandemic strategies for surviving a devastating blow to their business. AMC has indicated it is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;considering new avenues&lt;/a&gt; for revenue, perhaps by showing sporting events or tapping into the gaming community (though how that would even begin to look is anyone’s guess at this stage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FM0Fpz"&gt;“Every business has to evolve and adapt to the times, and theaters have done it several times over the past century. This is just kind of the first big example of it happening in at least a generation or more,” Robbins said. “We’ve seen expansions and dine-in theaters, bars, premium screens like IMAX and several chains have their own proprietary formats — Regal has RPX and then there’s the Dolby Cinema. I think these types of enhanced viewing experiences are the way of the future for theaters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F43D4p"&gt;Moving forward, theaters may have to rely on these enhanced experiences and things like subscription and loyalty services to boost their business. Ticket bundling or dynamic ticket pricing based on the demand for a movie could also benefit both theaters and paying audiences who may not want to pay the same price to see smaller titles as they do for major releases, Robbins said. In the future, studios will also have to coalesce around a more standardized release model, though that could potentially take several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWXp9S"&gt;At the end of the day, though, studios have shown they need theaters just as much as cinemas need their films. “I think the fact that Warner Bros. has been very vocal,” Robbins said, “and now several times committed to going back to exclusive windows starting next year, really underlines where the future of this is going.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Craig Federighi says Apple’s child safety scanning will have ‘multiple levels of auditability’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MzJYUURQ9UFgjUd0TWsSS-N-4HU=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721417/1232992663.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tPKT38"&gt;Apple executive Craig Federighi says iCloud Photos’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;plans to scan for child sexual abuse material&lt;/a&gt; (or CSAM) will include “multiple levels of auditability.” In &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Federighi — Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering — offered new details about its controversial child safety measures. That includes a claim that the iPad and iPhone’s device-level scanning will help security experts verify that Apple is using the system responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZeals"&gt;Like many companies with cloud storage services, Apple will check iCloud Photos images against a list from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), looking for exact matches with known CSAM pictures. But unlike many services, it will run searches on the device, not fully remotely. “Imagine someone was scanning images in the cloud. Well, who knows what’s being scanned for?” Federighi said, referring to remote scans. “In our case, the database is shipped on device. People can see, and it’s a single image across all countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DjUrf"&gt;Federighi elaborated slightly on how this might give people confidence Apple isn’t greatly expanding the database to include material besides illegal CSAM, particularly in countries with restrictive censorship policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vMPNRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5anlI"&gt;“We ship the same software in China with the same database we ship in America, as we ship in Europe. If someone were to come to Apple [with a request to scan for data beyond CSAM], Apple would say no. But let’s say you aren’t confident. You don’t want to just rely on Apple saying no. You want to be sure that Apple couldn’t get away with it if we said yes,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. “There are multiple levels of auditability, and so we’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country, as far as what images are part of this process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7s92c"&gt;Apple has previously said that it’s only rolling out the system in the United States and that it will &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/apple-says-any-expansion-of-csam-detection-outside-of-the-us-will-occur-on-a-per-country-basis/"&gt;consider launching in other countries&lt;/a&gt; on a case-by-case basis. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple will ship the hash database of known CSAM on the operating system in all countries, but it will only be used for scanning in the US. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; further clarifies that there will be an independent auditor who can verify the images involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7QNze"&gt;Federighi also offered more detail on when the scanning system will notify an Apple moderator of potential illegal content. Apple has said before that a single match won’t trigger a red flag — a measure intended to prevent false positives. Instead, the system generates “safety vouchers” for each match and alerts Apple if the number hits a certain threshold. Apple has declined to publicize the exact threshold, saying this could let abusers evade detection. But Federighi says it’s “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFkTE8"&gt;Some security experts have offered cautious praise of Apple’s system and acknowledged the importance of finding CSAM online. But many have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;criticized Apple’s abrupt rollout&lt;/a&gt; and a lack of clarity on how the system worked. In his interview with the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Federighi acknowledged the confusion. “It’s really clear a lot of messages got jumbled pretty badly in terms of how things were understood,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shut down German research on Instagram algorithm, researchers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hTxCWUkkds8TsSvBS8NwCs9AYUE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721373/wjoel_180319_2394_facebook_006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2cIU7e"&gt;Researchers at AlgorithmWatch say they were forced to abandon their research project monitoring the Instagram algorithm after legal threats from Facebook. The Berlin-based project went public with the conflict in a post &lt;a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook/"&gt;published Friday morning&lt;/a&gt;, citing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;the platform’s recent ban of the NYU Ad Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLeorF"&gt;“There are probably more cases of bullying that we do not know about,” the post reads. “We hope that by coming forward, more organizations will speak up about their experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oCCI6t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the company cannot be trusted”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d2ZbFa"&gt;Launched in March 2020, AlgorithmWatch provided a browser plug-in that would allow users to collect data from their Instagram feeds, providing insight into how the platform prioritizes pictures and videos. The project published findings regularly, showing that the algorithm &lt;a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-algorithm-nudity/"&gt;encouraged photos that showed bare skin&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-algorithm-politicians/"&gt;photos showing faces are ranked higher than screenshots of text&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook disputed the methodology but did not otherwise take action against AlgorithmWatch for the first year of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5j4R1"&gt;In May, researchers say Facebook asked to meet with the project leaders and accused them of violating the platform’s terms of service. Another objection was that the project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;violated the GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, since it collected data from users who had not consented to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZaZKp"&gt;“We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,” the researchers say in their defense. “In other words, users of the plug-in where only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAg0z4"&gt;Still, the researchers ultimately chose to shut down the project, believing they would face legal action from the company if it continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxPzfQ"&gt;Reached for comment, a Facebook representative confirmed the meeting, but denied threatening to sue the project, saying the company was open to find privacy-preserving ways to continue the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBqzDs"&gt;“We had concerns with their practices, which is why we contacted them multiple times so they could come into compliance with our terms and continue their research, as we routinely do with other research groups when we identify similar concerns,” the representative said. “We intend to keep working with independent researchers, but in ways that don’t put people’s data or privacy at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="St1H3e"&gt;The social nature of the Facebook platforms makes it difficult to isolate any single user: even when a user opts in, their feed is necessarily made out of other people’s content, who likely have not consented to participate in the research. Facebook has been particularly sensitive about research projects since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw academic research data ultimately used for commercial and political manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4tNli"&gt;Still, the broader pattern is a troubling one. The algorithms that manage news feeds on Facebook and Instagram are immensely powerful but poorly understood, and Facebook’s policies make it difficult to study them objectively. The NYU Ad Observatory, which tracked political advertising on the platform, saw its researchers banned earlier this month amid accusations of data scraping. In November, the company &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/once-again-facebook-using-privacy-sword-kill-independent-innovation"&gt;made similar legal threats&lt;/a&gt; against a browser called Friendly, which let users reorder their feeds chronologically. CrowdTangle, another popular tool for Facebook research, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle"&gt;acquired by the company in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpjNWE"&gt;Facebook has some mechanisms for researchers to collect data directly from the company, including the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;media_type=all"&gt;Ad Library&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522473/facebook-election-influence-meddling-research-data-democracy"&gt;its Social Science One partnerships&lt;/a&gt;. But AlgorithmWatch says the oppositional nature of their research makes the data inherently untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evBrPu"&gt;“Researchers cannot rely on data provided by Facebook because the company cannot be trusted,” researchers say. “There is no reason to believe that Facebook would provide usable data, were researchers to replace their independently collected data with the company’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSSPEF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s latest keyboard accessories offer an easy way to spruce up your mech  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UEbTk7VniqC_Don12B6I3gJHgCw=/0x0:5946x3964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721084/PBT_Keycap___Coiled_Cable_066___R1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s PBT keycaps can now be bought with a matching USB cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVClQP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fshop%2Fkeyboards%2Fgaming-keyboards-accessories&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; is expanding its range of mechanical keyboard accessories with new keycaps, cables, and wrist rests which offer a convenient way to change the look and feel of your keyboard. The accessories start at $20 for the new wrist rests, ranging up to $50 for a customization kit that includes both colorful keycaps and a matching USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzTSJB"&gt;If you’ve spent any time on forums like the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalKeyboards"&gt;Mechanical Keyboards subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, then you’ll be no stranger to the fantastically colorful keycaps people like to customize their keyboards with. But beyond fast-growing enthusiast stores like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623320%2Frazer-pbt-keycaps-coiled-cable-wrist-rest-abs-caps-mechanical-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Drop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamingrace.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623320%2Frazer-pbt-keycaps-coiled-cable-wrist-rest-abs-caps-mechanical-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Glorious PC Gaming Race&lt;/a&gt;, many of the best caps out there come from limited runs from smaller manufacturers, or with lengthy wait times. Razer’s designs might be more basic, but it’s a major manufacturer which sells through retailers around the world, which makes its products very easy to get hold of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vcvpw9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10699935"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TwdOO3"&gt;First up are new $50 customization sets. These include the same 120 keycaps made of durable PBT plastic that Razer has previously sold as a set for $30, with the addition of a new coiled USB-C to USB-A cable. They’re available in black, white, green, and pink, and feature durable double-shot legends that also let your keyboard’s backlighting shine through. They support both US and UK keyboard layouts, but &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/if-you-want-to-customize-your-mechanical-keyboard-raze-1847460283"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that they don’t support some less common layouts like the 65-percent Blackwidow V3 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmXiJm"&gt;Next up are the $35 Phantom Keycap sets, which are available in black and white. The unique thing here is that the bottom half of the keycap is translucent, which should pair well with backlit keyboards. They’re made of less premium ABS plastic (which tends to develop a shine over time), but come with 128 keycaps in the set, meaning better support for keyboards with less standard layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wrist rests for all the family. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fUICyM"&gt;Finally there are Razer’s new $20 wrist rests for compact tenkeyless and mini keyboards. They’re meant to offer more comfort compared to the rests that come with many of Razer’s keyboards, with a memory foam interior that should be a little easier on the wrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9Sbix"&gt;Razer’s new kits are available on Razer.com now, and the company says they’re coming to more retailers from September 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
