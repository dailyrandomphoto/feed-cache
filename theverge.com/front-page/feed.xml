    <title>Babble Royale turns Scrabble into Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNShDZuvD9HZTSphyRXwIwZ5ILI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283572/ss_dfbfbf247467f68361989aa1eaeb1944e4d31a78.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxQ5az"&gt;There used to be a joke that every game was turning into a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style battle royale, and here to make that bit a reality is &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale,&lt;/em&gt; a new Scrabble-style competitive online multiplayer game from designer Frank Lantz’s Everybody House Games (best known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/10/11/16457742/ai-paperclips-thought-experiment-game-frank-lantz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Paperclips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203463/hey-robot-smart-speaker-alexa-siri-google-assistant-web-free-quarantine"&gt;Hey Robot&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtZHVU"&gt;Despite the fact that it feels like a joke meant to clown on Fortnite, PUGB, and other last-person-standing games in the genre, &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale &lt;/em&gt;is very much a real game, currently available on Steam in early access for both PC and Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1dJpyJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Babble Royale is now live in early access! I think it's the funnest game I've ever worked on. Come see for yourself.&lt;a href="https://t.co/5vxJDAlYXD"&gt;https://t.co/5vxJDAlYXD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/N6WGBpB8AM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N6WGBpB8AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Frank Lantz (@flantz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flantz/status/1471192145453215745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="emrTSK"&gt;Players parachute their beginning tile down into a grid (yes, actually), claiming a spot for themselves to start building words (as you would in Scrabble or Bananagrams) to expand outwards and eliminate other players. As you explore the map, you can spell your way onto tiles to pick up powerups or purchase additional upgrades using money gained by spelling bigger words. As time goes on, a “hot zone” will slowly creep in from the corner of the map, damaging or eliminating players from contention until only one speller reigns supreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdHXa0"&gt;And of course, there are optional cosmetics available to purchase to customize your character (i.e., the letter you parachute in with) with different patterns or hats. Yes, seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54GFvBDRrn4AtjvPwExAJlBGRww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23102448/ss_79f91b9d34922f7511aa1c7c0987ab9d1014a003.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;This is the world we live in now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sHO4nX"&gt;I tried playing a few rounds of &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt;, but while the concept is fun as a high-brow joke on the genre, I bounced off pretty hard on the actual gameplay. You can only play new letters off the last word that you spelled, which means that longtime Scrabble players will have to seriously think about how they play. There were also times where I just was plain stuck, walled in by existing words but unable to play any real ones of my own, leaving me to sit around until the game cleared out some of the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYqH54"&gt;But for those who like competitive word games and don’t mind taking the time to adjust to &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale’s&lt;/em&gt; new strategies and idiosyncrasies, the new title is certainly one of the cleverest spins on the concept so far. The initial launch of &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt; is also still in “Season Zero” as an early access launch, with more features and content planned for the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cln7VP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1759440/Babble_Royale/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is available to download for free now on Steam. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4jXkQ8uM8UoHOmLgQAZJSNPkZc=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149161/Kids.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts that will cultivate curiosity, creativity, and so much more &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="j0Yebj"&gt;Kids can be tricky giftees. They want toys, of course, but the sheer abundance of available options can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know where to start. And while you could make life easier by asking your kids what they want, they’ll likely bombard you with a laundry list of items, some of which might not be realistic. Besides, there are other factors to consider, including your budget and whether a gift is age-appropriate or safe for your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rG96i"&gt;With little time left before the holidays and shipping deadlines hanging overhead, we’ve decided to do the hard work for you. Below, we’ve compiled a list of gifts suitable for kids of all ages, ranging from tried-and-true classics like the Lite-Brite ($13) to newer additions, such as the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids ($120), Wekapo’s Inflatable Lounger ($38), and Wing’s second-gen electric bike ($910). There are also a number of STEM toys and educational gifts for younger children, as well as a few designed to spur their creativity on paper and get them moving outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwExzX"&gt;Take a look, and see what kind of fun stuff you can gift the kids in your life this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 console bundles in-store on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNavx3OJfdavVFpChqU7EzA-Ad0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282982/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;GameStop has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a special in-store sales event&lt;/a&gt; for the hard-to-get Sony PlayStation 5 console, taking place on December 17th. The restock event requires &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergegamestopinstoreps5&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt; — which normally runs $14.99 per year but is currently discounted to $9.99 once added to your cart. GameStop &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/12-17_PS5Event_StoreList"&gt;lists all its participating retail locations&lt;/a&gt; on its site, which spans over 700 stores across the US. While this event is being hosted at many locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkZMTo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/exclusive-ps5-restock-at-gamestop"&gt;According to Matt Swider’s &lt;em&gt;The Shortcut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GameStop will have around 60 disc-based PS5 bundles at participating stores. The bundles will supposedly consist of a PS5 console, &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, a third-party DualSense charging station, and an additional Sony DualSense controller. Some stores may also include a $50 GameStop gift card. Additionally, Swider claims a similar in-store event for the Xbox Series X is expected next week on Thursday, December 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Dqxf"&gt;Despite launching over one year ago, Sony’s PlayStation 5 is still very difficult to buy. If you have been struggling to luck out on recent online console restocks from GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, or other vendors, this may be one of the few remaining chances to score a PS5 in time for the Christmas holiday. GameStop sells its new consoles in bundle form only, so while you should not be paying more than MSRP, you can expect to potentially pay upwards of $700 or $800 depending on what accessories are being bundled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVbhtx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5:02PM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about expected quantities, bundle contents, and an upcoming Xbox Series X restock, as detailed in &lt;/em&gt;The Shortcut&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta alerts 50,000 users to targeting by ‘surveillance-for-hire’ companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4mG9WX89EGCFALMf6_zLv2iw220=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283496/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWV9vd"&gt;Facebook’s parent company Meta has alerted 50,000 users of Facebook and Instagram that their accounts were spied on by commercial “surveillance-for-hire” schemes around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEjhSd"&gt;The users were targeted by seven entities and located in more than 100 countries, according to an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-action-against-surveillance-for-hire/"&gt;update posted on Meta’s news page&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1ug8q"&gt;Targets included journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists, the post said. The surveillance was uncovered in a monthslong investigation in which Meta identified spying groups and removed them from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psQWhT"&gt;“These companies are part of a sprawling industry that provides intrusive software tools and surveillance services indiscriminately to any customer — regardless of who they target or the human rights abuses they might enable,” wrote Meta’s director of threat disruption, David Agranovich, and head of cyber espionage investigations, Mike Dvilyanski. “This industry ‘democratizes’ these threats, making them available to government and non-government groups that otherwise wouldn’t have these capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6mdpR"&gt;A more detailed &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Threat-Report-on-the-Surveillance-for-Hire-Industry.pdf"&gt;threat report&lt;/a&gt; released by Meta named six out of the seven companies, and listed one of the entities as unknown. Four of the seven — Cobwebs Technologies, Cognyte, Black Cube, and Bluehawk CI — are based in Israel, with the other three in China, India, and North Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0NZD"&gt;In a statement provided to NPR, Black Cube &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/16/1064628654/facebook-bans-surveillance-firms-that-spied-on-50000-people"&gt;described itself as a “litigation support firm”&lt;/a&gt; that used investigation methods compliant with local laws in every jurisdiction in which it operated. Black Cube was previously employed by Harvey Weinstein to try to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/harvey-weinstein-black-cube-new-york-times"&gt;block publication of a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; that sparked the #MeToo movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKDhXi"&gt;“The disclosure by Facebook of actions it has taken to disrupt and remove seven private firms selling surveillance services to regimes that abuse human rights, makes it abundantly clear that more must be done to stop this mercenary marketplace,” said Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) in a statement. “By enabling indiscriminate surveillance against journalists and political dissidents, among others, these companies pose a clear threat to human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pdhsap"&gt;Meta’s report also referenced the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which last month was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798917/apple-nso-group-spyware-pegasus-cybersecurity-research"&gt;sued by both Apple and Meta&lt;/a&gt; for selling spyware used to compromise iPhone and WhatsApp messages. Yesterday, Google researchers &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html"&gt;published details of a “zero click” exploit&lt;/a&gt; developed by NSO Group to hack targets’ phones just by sending a message — a level of offensive capability described by the researchers as comparable to that possessed by nation state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgeJvD"&gt;The company has already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;blacklisted by the US government&lt;/a&gt; for selling software used to spy on journalists around the world. A group of lawmakers including Adam Schiff recently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-lawmakers-call-sanctions-against-israels-nso-other-spyware-firms-2021-12-15/"&gt;called for the imposition of stricter sanctions&lt;/a&gt; on a group of surveillance companies, including NSO Group, that would freeze company bank accounts and bar employees from traveling to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM announces Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is stepping down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GM’s Cruise Reveals First Vehicle Made To Run Without Driver" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_3fYM2AXHLvpbL6EwxrWpHNgYI=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283484/1195279039.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T4teru"&gt;Dan Ammann, the CEO of Cruise, the autonomous vehicle company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors, is stepping down, &lt;a href="https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/leadership-changes-cruise"&gt;the automaker announced late Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Kyle Vogt, the co-founder of Cruise and its chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TH4phn"&gt;Ammann is the latest CEO of an AV company to step aside as the industry struggles to meet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;its own over-inflated expectations&lt;/a&gt; about the future of driverless cars. Earlier this year, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x7RK2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM didn’t provide a reason for Ammann’s departure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdknG"&gt;GM didn’t provide a reason for Ammann’s departure except to say he was leaving to “pursue other opportunities.” A spokesperson for Cruise declined to provide any additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckW2Np"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/11/11195808/gm-cruise-automation-self-driving-acquisition"&gt;GM acquired Cruise in 2016&lt;/a&gt; to speed up its self-driving car development program. Ammann, who was then the president of GM, oversaw the acquisition and later assumed the role of CEO of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVvUbo"&gt;In 2020, he presided over the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;the Origin&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first purpose-built autonomous vehicle. Under his leadership, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331794/cruise-acquires-voyage-self-driving-car-merger"&gt;acquired rival AV startup Voyage&lt;/a&gt; and raised enough investment to bring its valuation up to $19 billion. And earlier this year, he outlined a plan to scale up Cruise’s fleet to 1 million vehicles by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma0ODq"&gt;But Ammann also oversaw some setbacks, most noticeably the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;delay a planned launch of a robotaxi service&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco in 2019. The company has yet to commit to a new date but has implied it will be in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o87ylB"&gt;“GM is deeply committed to its vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion, and AV technology will play a critical role in realizing it,” GM said in a statement. “Under GM’s ownership to date, Cruise has seized the leadership position in commercial autonomous ridesharing and has created significant value for both GM shareholders and Cruise’s minority shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Show 15 review: Alexa’s on your wall</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This Echo Show on the wall is the fairest of them all, but it’s not that smart  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fkjUWo"&gt;The original idea for Amazon’s Echo Show was a large, screen-based device that would offer up relevant, glanceable information for the modern family, replacing outdated devices like bulletin boards, paper calendars, and sticky notes on the fridge. In 2017, Amazon couldn’t quite achieve that vision for a price that a modern family would be willing to pay. So, instead, it released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15865292/amazon-echo-show-alexa-review"&gt;small, squat seven-inch touchscreen smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; that, frankly, did little more than Amazon’s screen-less Echos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08tjb1"&gt;But it was a start. And as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;Echo Show has evolved over the ensuing four years&lt;/a&gt;, the company finally has a device that it thinks fits that original vision: the Echo Show 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CaGBMJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10927033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lnGwZr"&gt;The $249.99 Echo Show 15 is billed as a shared hub for families to see things like upcoming calendar appointments, to-dos, digital sticky note reminders, and shopping lists. It’s also an excellent kitchen TV (not a high bar, to be fair). Of course, it does everything other Echo displays and speakers do, thanks to the presence of Amazon’s smart voice assistant, Alexa. This includes playing music, showing weather reports, streaming video, controlling smart home gadgets, telling fart jokes, all the stuff you’ve come to rely on Alexa for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiQzbX"&gt;A very solid piece of hardware, the Echo Show 15 is a stunning device. It looks impressive on your wall when called into action, and otherwise blends into the background as a digital photo frame displaying art or family photos. It fills a niche that no device has reliably conquered to date: a wall-mounted tablet to replace the plethora of analog paper tools busy households traditionally rely on to communicate with each other. You can use it on your countertop with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LF68JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an optional stand&lt;/a&gt; if you can find the room — at 15.8 x 9.9 x 1.4 inches, this thing is huge — but the wall is the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPagWr"&gt;The concept is good. But the execution is underwhelming. As is a theme with Amazon devices, on day one there is plenty of room for improvement on the software front. There’s a lot crammed onto this admittedly large screen, but ultimately while the Echo Show 15 tries to be something for everyone, it ends up struggling to be particularly useful for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MF2A_rhwtifc1hZKLtpphgu2sno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086571/dseifert_211208_4924_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 can be mounted on the wall or on a counter (with an additional stand) in either portrait or landscape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nh8WoI"&gt;In terms of specs, the Echo Show 15 is a 15.6-inch screen with a 1080p touch display, with the processing power of the new Amazon AZ2 neural edge processor behind it — the first Show to use Amazon’s latest chip. It has a new homescreen layout that divides its time between the standard rotating Echo Show content (which you can customize) and a new feature: widgets. You can also have it just display art or photos (stored in Amazon Photos or Facebook, nowhere else, sadly), fulfilling its picture frame ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9qkkL"&gt;Aesthetically, the Echo Show has a black frame with a white mat, resembling a standard picture frame. Tech-wise it looks like the Samsung Frame TV and the Facebook Portal had a baby. It comes in one color, and you can’t change the familiar Alexa blue background behind the widgets — I’d like to see some customization options all around. Two 1.6 speakers on either side (or top and bottom in portrait) provide decent if slightly tinny sound, and a small row of buttons on the top or side (depending on orientation) offer volume up / down, mute, and camera shutter controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IemQc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Show 15, like Goldilocks’ proverbial porridge, is just the right size. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVSlRy"&gt;The widget concept is a nice addition, and the potential is huge — especially as Amazon has released an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;API that developers can use&lt;/a&gt; to add widgets to their Alexa Skills. Currently, however, you’re stuck with a dozen or so Amazon widgets that are limited in their usefulness. They include calendar and reminders (you can import calendars from Google, Apple, and Microsoft), shopping list, sticky notes, smart home controls, a to-do list (Alexa only), weather, your commute, photos, maps, music and audio, reorder suggestions, Alexa suggestions, and your Amazon deliveries. A new What to Eat option offers up recipes and nearby delivery suggestions from partners such as Domino’s and Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQXLDZ"&gt;In our app-driven world, you likely already have favorite tools that do most of these things, and frustratingly, you can’t port any of them to the Show. It’s all Amazon, for now. There’s also limited customization, and while you can rearrange and resize some widgets, if you have any enabled they take up almost half the screen. While the Show 15 is noticeably snappier than others in the family, it’s not super responsive and takes two or three seconds to respond to taps and swipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixMTZl"&gt;Interestingly, the widgets take the Show from being a voice-first device (which is something I’ve always struggled with) to one with a lot more touch functionality. It’s the most tactile Show to date, and the widgets invite you to come on in and stay awhile as you check your calendar, browse shows to watch on the expanded Video Home screen, and attempt to control your smart home from the (limited) Smart Home widget (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 is best suited for wall mounting and can be set to just display photos until someone approaches it when it switches to the widget format.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wnwvA0"&gt;While the Show 15 is designed as a hub for family organization, it is not a communication device. My biggest disappointment here is its 5-megapixel camera that produced pixelated, blown-out images during my Alexa calling and Drop-In testing. (Zoom is not yet supported, but Amazon says it will be coming next year.) Despite the souped-up processor, video constantly freezes and lags, making it unusable for an actual conversation. It also doesn’t have the auto-framing of its Echo Show 8 and Show 10 counterparts, both of which have a more robust 13-megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYEELh"&gt;It seems Amazon was looking for a differentiator from the Show 10, which Amazon tells me is its “communication device.” The rotating 10 can follow you around a room while you talk, keeping you in the frame as you chop veggies or unload the dishwasher. But who really is going to have a Show 10 and a Show 15 in their kitchen? Two $250 devices in one room seems like legitimate overkill. If they had bumped up the camera in the 15 to make video calling better, this would be a much more useful device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tMWfWH5Of2w9mWGgnCUTYm4_mcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086566/jtuohy_211209_4924_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slimline design allows room for speakers without a super bulky form factor when mounted on the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdP4cW"&gt;The best feature of the Show 15 is its size. To date, screens for the kitchen have either been too large (see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18170285/ge-google-netflix-spotify-exhaust-vent-smart-display-kitchen-hub-ces-2019"&gt;GE Appliances’ monstrous screen&lt;/a&gt; built into an over-the-range hood) or too inflexible (Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/4/11591780/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-hands-on-price-release-date"&gt;Family Hub fridge&lt;/a&gt; with a portrait tablet built in). The Show 15, like Goldilocks’ proverbial porridge, is just the right size. The 15.6-inch screen’s housing is just shy of 10 inches tall and 16 inches wide and is designed to fit under standard kitchen cabinets or between two doorways in an open plan house, Chris Green, VP of industrial design at Amazon Lab126, tells me. It’s also very flexible. You can mount it on the wall in either a portrait or landscape orientation, and thanks to the included, cleverly designed mount, it’s easy to swap it from one to the other when your use case changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9xrNQ"&gt;A compelling reason to buy this is for a good-quality, compact screen for watching TV while in the kitchen. It’s the first Echo Show to support full HD resolution streaming from Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, but it’s missing key players such as Disney Plus and HBO Max. Sling TV support is coming soon, which will bring another option for watching live TV (Hulu Live being the other).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUy1Pd"&gt;One downside, however, is the 16:9 ratio of the screen means you get two black bars when watching widescreen movies. The white picture frame design also doesn’t lend itself to immersive viewing — but for a kitchen TV, it’s a nice device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A52ML6"&gt;A new feature that makes this more useful is picture-in-picture. This allows you to view a security camera feed or video doorbell while also looking at other content. So, you can have a baby monitor running while you’re following a recipe. The Show can stream video from any Alexa-compatible camera and if you have a Ring video doorbell, it will pop up a live feed on the screen when someone rings the bell and you can talk to them through the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0bW7gOlLQJadV3kaZ35UuBT2fmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086569/dseifert_211208_4924_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The volume, mute, and camera cover buttons are on the top or side of the device, depending on how it’s mounted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogzfXFtrv833Pn71YwgIFCnkxKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086556/jtuohy_211207_4924_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mounting system works with a wall mount or stand (pictured) as well as other mounting accessories made by Sanus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frPXIA"&gt;In my testing, I initially assumed I’d want it in the landscape orientation — and for TV viewing, that was the best option. But for the family hub features — shopping lists, calendars, and even widget use — it was more helpful in portrait as you see more information on the screen. This was especially true for smart home control. And while you can’t pin a full-screen widget (it always reverts to the home screen), the full-sized portrait smart home widget shows 12 separate tiles for your devices, compared to just six or seven in the landscape. Frustratingly, you only get individual devices to control in the widget (no groups) but in the full-screen mode, you do get the option to use groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qSOoK"&gt;Setting up the Show is an easy process; once powered on, you walk through a series of screens to connect to Wi-Fi and accept Amazon’s litany of terms and agreements. New here is the option to add Visual ID (Voice ID and enabling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Amazon Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt; may also be new to you if you haven’t set up a Show in a while). These are all optional, but the Visual ID — a new feature that leverages that AZ2 processor — uses the camera to serve up relevant content such as calendar appointments, commute times, and notes from family members, depending on who is standing in front of it. It can even be used to gate content to kid-safe things if you set it up to recognize a child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl9Ffc"&gt;This is great in theory, but in my testing, it repeatedly failed to identify who was there and sometimes couldn’t see anyone at all. The Show can also recognize your voice, but that regularly failed in my testing, too. Amazon says the processing for the Visual ID happens locally, and the identifying information is stored on the Echo Show 15 itself, not in the cloud. The facial profiles aren’t shared across devices, so you need to set it up with each Echo Show 15. This feature is also coming to Show 8 and Show 10, according to Amazon’s press materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuKQkd"&gt;I ran into several issues setting up Visual ID and Voice ID for my family members, specifically my children. If you have Amazon Kids profiles set up already, you just tap on those in your account settings and walk through the process. I had no problems setting up my daughter’s Voice and Visual ID, but when it came to my 13-year-old son, the Show kept thinking he was my daughter. He was not amused. After the third time Alexa recognized him as a 10 year-old-girl, he was done with the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="UVPGxP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10927032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkuwd9"&gt;Visual ID was also buggy in everyday use — it seemed to like my daughter the best, often mistaking me and my husband for her. But occasionally, it just wouldn’t work at all, stubbornly refusing to see me as I stood in front of it. When it did work, the only real personalization features were recently played music. It can offer up different calendars based on who is viewing, but in the time I had to review the device, I wasn’t able to reconfigure all my family’s individual Apple and Google calendars to sync with Alexa. Instead, I ported in a shared Google calendar we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UieyI"&gt;I’d advise setting up the device first and trying it out in a couple of locations before committing to a wall mount, although that was my preference after spending a week testing it. The wall mount option is nowhere near as daunting as I’d anticipated. Amazon provides a paper template, and you’ll want to break out a level and a drill, but it’s mostly painless and not much more work than hanging a large picture or artwork on the wall. Drill holes for four screws, attach the wall mount, and you’re done. The Show slides onto the mount thanks to four grooves in the back and you can switch between portrait and landscape at will without having to re-drill anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO6Lyb"&gt;A tabletop stand sold separately &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LF68JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $30&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t offer as much flexibility (you need a screwdriver to reconfigure the orientation). For &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LFLKMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40&lt;/a&gt; there’s an option that will let you change from portrait to landscape without having to break out a screwdriver. An &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LCK96Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;under-cabinet mount for $50&lt;/a&gt; lets you tilt and swivel. I tested the $30 stand, and it’s solid and well-made but very large. The footprint this thing takes up on a countertop (289 square inches in our test setting) is too big for a lot of kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYHPYI"&gt;The biggest issue with wall mounting is going to be cable management. If you’re okay with a cord going down your wall and you have a nearby outlet, you’re all set. But if you’re like me, you are going to want to route this through the wall or devise another way to hide the cable. Amazon’s Chris Green tells me that snaking the cable through the wall as you might with a TV is perfectly fine, but you know — at your own risk and endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WE51ru"&gt;The Show 15 comes with a five-foot cable, potentially making placement tricky (a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LK8V8G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;six-foot extension cord is available for $13&lt;/a&gt;). I had nowhere in my kitchen to wall mount this, as all my walls are tiled, except for one corner of the room that would have made the perfect spot, but there’s no outlet anywhere nearby. I ended up placing it in portrait mode in a main hallway that we use to come in and out of the house. While we sacrifice the TV aspect this way, it’s actually a more useful place for some of those visual reminders, and I have the lights for the three closest rooms set up on the smart home widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UoIDdJ2917DmPN_k4Mdnvq4UOPA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086559/jtuohy_211207_4924_0008.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 is the largest smart display available today, here you can see it dwarfs the 10-inch Nest Hub Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CCcONQ"&gt;Speaking of the smart home side, it’s a big disappointment. There’s no Zigbee radio built in for connecting devices and the three or four individual devices you can access from the smart home widget limit its usefulness for managing your connected home. You can’t pin the full-screen smart home control to the display; it will always revert to the homepage. You also can’t tap the widget to get to it, you have to swipe down and tap the Smart Home button from the menu. I couldn’t even get a voice command to bring it up. It was not designed with the smart home front of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TInvot"&gt;However, if that’s not your primary use case, this can be a handy tool for household organization. That is once some software updates roll out to fix those Visual ID bugs and a few non-Alexa widgets start appearing. As of today, it’s only helpful if you are all-in on Amazon for organization of your shopping, reminders, and to-do lists. If you’ve been wanting a wall-mounted smart display, this is really your only ready-to-use option and will be a great addition to your kitchen if you’re happy with the limited ecosystem. But if you like using other services, I’d advise waiting to see what widgets third-party developers come up with before picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOZJaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 4:55PM ET, December 16th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated that it wasn’t possible to use the Echo Show 15’s camera as a motion sensor for Alexa Routines. That is incorrect, you are able to trigger routines using the camera as a motion sensor. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>French regulator tells Clearview AI to delete its facial recognition data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7XzDRkhNuEGpavF93LZLPqN11U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283387/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y92EHK"&gt;France’s foremost privacy regulator has ordered Clearview AI to delete all its data relating to French citizens, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/clearview-gdpr-breaches-france/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9okCes"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/reconnaissance-faciale-la-cnil-met-en-demeure-clearview-ai-de-cesser-la-reutilisation-de"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the French agency CNIL argued that Clearview had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;violated the GDPR&lt;/a&gt; in collecting the data and violated various other data access rights in its processing and storage. As a result, CNIL is calling on Clearview to purge the data from its systems or face escalating fines as laid out by European privacy law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17t1MP"&gt;Clearview rose to prominence in 2020 after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the company’s massive data collection efforts. In particular, the company offered the unique ability to identify subjects by name, drawing on data scraped from public-facing social networks. Subsequent reporting showed the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-trump-investors-friend-facial-recognition"&gt;deep ties to right-wing political activism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table"&gt;widespread use within US law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85rDny"&gt;CNIL’s motion is similar to a recently issued order in Australia, and it likely won’t be the last such order to come out of the EU. (Clearview has contested the order.) While CNIL only has jurisdiction over infringements on the rights of French citizens, other European regulators are sure to follow suit if the case is successful. Similar complaints have already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455446/clearview-ai-legal-privacy-complaint-privacy-international-facial-recognition-eu"&gt;filed by Privacy International&lt;/a&gt; in Greece, Italy, and Austria. Last year, the ACLU launched a similar case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;in US federal court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHt20q"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, CEO Hoan Ton-That insisted the company’s data was collected legally. “We only collect public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law,” Ton-That wrote. “My intentions and those of my company have always been to help communities and their people to live better, safer lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic is giving away 15 free games during its holiday sale, and the first is Shenmue III</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWtnNjlmR5Fx0OGa0mCdQoL4q5A=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283311/epic_games_store_holiday_sale_15_days_of_free_games_day_1_shenmue_3_1920x1080_695145bd5ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shenmue III is one of 15 games Epic is giving away.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HbubWI"&gt;Epic Games’ annual holiday sale is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/massive-discounts-and-limitless-10-off-coupons-hit-the-epic-games-store"&gt;now live&lt;/a&gt;, and in addition to offering some nice discounts on many titles, the company will also be giving away 15 free games. Epic is also bringing back the Epic Coupon, which gives you $10 off games that cost more than $14.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAdbHD"&gt;The first freebie is &lt;em&gt;Shenmue III&lt;/em&gt;, which began life as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/16/8788395/shenmue-3-kickstarter-funded-release-date"&gt;hugely popular Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. The company hasn’t said what games are next, and Epic spokesperson Nick Chester declined to comment on what games are coming down the pike — you’ll have to check the store every day to see what Epic is offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SPY0jN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Epic Coupon is a good deal, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lERu6F"&gt;While you’re browsing the store, you’ll want to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/massive-discounts-and-limitless-10-off-coupons-hit-the-epic-games-store"&gt;Epic Coupon in mind&lt;/a&gt;. It gives you $10 off &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; title that’s more than $14.99 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has no limit to how many games you can use it with, so feel free to load up your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826563/epic-games-store-shopping-cart"&gt;(newly added) shopping cart&lt;/a&gt;. The sale runs until January 6th at 11AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voao6P"&gt;Epic has also kicked off its annual holiday event in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; where players can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22838346/fortnite-holiday-event-2021-spider-man-tom-holland"&gt;unlock free stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast delays new data caps for at least another year, which is weird because it should be forever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xfinity Truck" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJDzORT4mbTVd85ltEwp_Ow2XuA=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283297/1209128540.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WccXr5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"&gt;The majority&lt;/a&gt; of Comcast Xfinity internet customers have suffered ridiculous and unnecessary data caps since 2016, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;planned to extend those caps&lt;/a&gt; to a dozen more US states this year. But after taking well-deserved flak for attempting to bilk customers in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Comcast delayed them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;once&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291469/comcast-delays-northeast-data-cap-rollout-2022"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and now a third time — now they won’t arrive until 2023 at the earliest, &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-tech/comcast-will-keep-data-caps-out-of-the-northeast-in-2022/d/d-id/774117"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joTtsb"&gt;“We don’t have plans to implement our data usage plan in our Northeast markets in 2022 at this time,” a Comcast spokesperson told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep8n5h"&gt;Does that mean the planned 1.2TB data cap for those states is gone for good, or is Comcast simply biding its time? Hard to say. Technically, “We don’t have plans ... at this time” is a turn of phrase with plenty of wiggle room: Comcast could make new plans tomorrow if it wanted. It just wouldn’t be good for the company’s public image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F36JWM"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Light Reading &lt;/em&gt;suggests it &lt;em&gt;might actually &lt;/em&gt;be an end to that plan, because Massachusetts State Representative Andy Vargas (D) is &lt;a href="https://whav.net/2021/12/15/rep-vargas-calls-comcasts-abandonment-of-data-caps-and-penalties-a-huge-win/"&gt;claiming a political victory&lt;/a&gt; — he says he helped get Comcast to abandon the expansion of its data caps altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wClm3f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Comcast, which postponed its planned data caps and penalties on northeast customers when it came under fire at the peak of the current pandemic, has abandoned the plan altogether.&lt;/p&gt;— Andy X. Vargas (@RepAndyVargas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyVargas/status/1471109200466096132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HBvge"&gt;To which I say: what about the rest of us? The majority of Comcast internet customers are already limited to that same 1.2TB unless we pay Comcast an extra $30-a-month surcharge for unlimited data, or paying $10 per 50GB per month when we go over, and the same logic Vargas and co. used should apply to the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2qweK"&gt;In case you’re not convinced that data caps are unnecessary, here’s a snippet of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;a popular story I wrote almost exactly one year ago&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yttV3K"&gt;Forget for a moment that Comcast itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2015/11/7/9687976/comcast-data-caps-are-not-about-fixing-network-congestion"&gt;was caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; explaining that data caps have nothing to do with network congestion. Forget that the CEOs of several smaller ISPs &lt;a href="https://money.com/internet-data-caps-bogus-ploys/"&gt;have admitted that internet capacity is anything but scarce&lt;/a&gt;. Forget that Comcast &lt;em&gt;disabled its own congestion management system&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/comcast-says-it-doesnt-throttle-heaviest-internet-users-anymore/"&gt;because it found it was unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. Forget even that Comcast is a wildly profitable company whose cable division spends &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-4th-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only a tenth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of its yearly revenues on keeping that network strong. The proof that data caps are a swindle is something you probably witnessed yourself earlier this year: Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179330/comcast-t-mobile-coronavirus-data-caps-hotspots-fcc"&gt;suspended their data caps&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and the internet kept on working without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EbzsOU"&gt;Just remember: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365753/wow-wideopenwest-internet-cable-data-cap-pizza-excuse"&gt;internet data caps are not like pizza&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt8PPE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tVoNJf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A cable company that prided itself on no data caps says you’re getting data caps because pizza","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365753/wow-wideopenwest-internet-cable-data-cap-pizza-excuse"},{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="y4rQuu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian will build a second, $5 billion EV plant in Georgia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQHOO7n2P-3RVw1E8Cavhn-HJwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283222/mclark_210923_4776_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZoFg65"&gt;Amazon-backed EV startup Rivian is going to build a second factory in Georgia where it will assemble up to 400,000 electric vehicles per year. The company &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521359139/d236890dex992.htm"&gt;made the announcement on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; alongside state representatives after months of speculation over where it would look to expand its manufacturing footprint. Rivian will start construction of the $5 billion facility in the summer of 2022 and expects to start making vehicles there in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsqZEZ"&gt;Rivian is already building its first electric pickup trucks at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois. The company also said Thursday that it has shipped its first two SUVs. It is also committed to producing 100,000 custom delivery vans for Amazon, so it has been searching for a place to create a factory from the ground up for future vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Exafpi"&gt;Rivian &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/rivian-in-talks-to-build-ev-factory-near-fort-worth-texas"&gt;had been in talks with Forth Worth, Texas&lt;/a&gt; to build the new factory there and was evaluating “multiple locations” as recently as August. The new factory in Georgia will be built about an hour east of Atlanta and will employ 7,500 workers. Rivian says it plans to build a “co-located” battery cell production facility in the area as well. It’s not immediately clear how much Rivian is getting in state and local incentives, but the &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/rivian-confirms-ev-factory-thousands-of-jobs-coming-to-georgia/CUH7ZNS5URGODNQG7CEUU2FCVY/?outputType=amp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which broke the news last week that the factory announcement was coming — says the figure is expected to be “staggering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aNyaec"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Construction begins in 2022, first vehicles come off the line in 2024&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7WFr12"&gt;Founded in 2009, Rivian took a slow path to where it is today. It didn’t come out of stealth mode until 2018, shortly before it debuted the pickup truck (the R1T) and SUV (the R1S) at that year’s LA Auto Show. Since then, though, it has been on an incredible rise. It has hired thousands of employees, collected billions of dollars in funding from Amazon, Ford, T. Rowe Price, and others, and recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;went public in one of the biggest IPOs in US history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2biot"&gt;The startup’s grand ambitions come with a high price tag, though, as it has said it expects to spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;$8 billion through the end of 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian revealed Thursday that it lost $1.23 billion in the third quarter of 2021 alone, though it is finally generating revenue as it delivered the first 11 R1T pickup trucks — good for $1 million in sales. The startup says it has produced 652 R1 vehicles to date and delivered 386, including the first two R1S SUVs, but that it will fall “a few hundred vehicles short of our 2021 production target of 1,200.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bObzz6"&gt;Rivian finished the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash, but says that the proceeds of its IPO and other recent funding rounds have already boosted that figure to $19.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a6Q5T"&gt;Rivian has taken around 55,000 preorders for the R1T and R1S combined and has said that it will take two years to make all those vehicles alongside the Amazon delivery vans. (In Thursday’s regulatory filing, the startup said the number of preorders has gone up to 71,000). But the company has other future models in the works and plans to sell non-delivery vans to other commercial customers, so it needs more capacity. The Illinois plant is currently only able to make as many as 150,000 vehicles per year, though Rivian has said it believes that can be stretched to 200,000 by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eMSBh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
