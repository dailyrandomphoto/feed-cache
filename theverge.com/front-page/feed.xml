    <title>HTC now lets you directly buy Vive repair parts through iFixit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="vive space pirates" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDLJoseY5BG2s1yOIbK3VXUqmAU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192939/Vive_Space_Pirates.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QicUrB"&gt;HTC has partnered with iFixit to make its Vive virtual reality systems more repairable, selling a list of screws, cables, adapters, and other standalone components directly to consumers. &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2021/04/26/vive-ifixit-repair-partner/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, HTC says the move is aimed at helping people whose headsets are out of warranty or potentially no longer being sold. iFixit also offers repair guides for the original Vive, the Vive Pro, the original Vive controller, and the Vive Pro Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH1pe4"&gt;HTC confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this is the first time consumers have been able to order many of these replacement parts directly. A few listings, like a $3.99 controller lanyard, wouldn’t be hard to find through other sellers. But VR headsets are specialized and niche devices, so if you want a replacement foam pad ($19.99) and set of headphones ($59.99) for your Vive audio strap, or you’ve lost the power adapter for your link box ($19.99), this is a lot more reliable than hunting for an unofficial replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhvlgy"&gt;The Vive, first released in 2016, has always been a relatively modular headset compared to the Sony PlayStation VR or Oculus Rift and Quest lineup. HTC has released several upgrade kits with features like wireless streaming and eye tracking, some of which have been later integrated into standalone headset packages. (Its latest module is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323093/htc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price"&gt;a lip tracker&lt;/a&gt;.) The consumer-focused Vive Cosmos — which iFixit doesn’t list an official guide for — comes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145156/htc-vive-cosmos-series-announced-elite-play-xr-faceplates"&gt;multiple variants&lt;/a&gt; with different swappable faceplates. The entire Vive ecosystem is built on top of Valve’s SteamVR, and some pieces are cross-compatible with the Valve Index. As HTC keeps building out its ecosystem, a home repair option seems like a natural fit for the brand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Legal chatbot firm DoNotPay adds anti-facial recognition filters to its suite of handy tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCu15NxD4Hvg6YLXLpwvlClMmPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192915/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BPTk4B"&gt;Legal services startup &lt;a href="http://donotpay.com/"&gt;DoNotPay&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its army of “robot lawyers” — automated bots that tackle tedious online tasks like canceling TV subscriptions and requesting refunds from airlines. Now, the company has unveiled a new tool it says will help shield users’ photos from reverse image searches and facial recognition AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PKCte"&gt;It’s called Photo Ninja and it’s one of dozens of DoNotPay widgets that subscribers can access for $36 a year. Photo Ninja operates like any image filter. Upload a picture you want to shield, and the software adds a layer of pixel-level perturbations that are barely noticeable to humans, but dramatically alter the image in the eyes of roving machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my0SDE"&gt;The end result, DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is that any image shielded with Photo Ninja yields zero results when run through search tools like Google image search or TinEye. You can see this in the example below using pictures of Joe Biden:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0s0eovwN3CpJp68Xibogpus36c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473043/biden_before.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DoNotPay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before Photo Ninja, you get plenty of results from Google Image Search (top) and TinEye (below). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4bGsXLquZL1HZBh3R_G4V6bJH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473044/biden_after.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DoNotPay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After Photo Ninja, the image yields no results in reverse image searches. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fwNIrj"&gt;The tool also fools popular facial recognition software from Microsoft and Amazon with a 99 percent success rate. This, combined with the anti-reverse-image search function, makes Photo Ninja handy in a range of scenarios. You might be uploading a selfie to social media, for example, or a dating app. Running the image through Photo Ninja first will prevent people from connecting this image to other information about you on the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dknKn"&gt;Browder is careful to stress, though, that Photo Ninja isn’t guaranteed to beat every facial recognition tool out there. When it comes to Clearview AI, for example, a controversial facial recognition service that is &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table"&gt;widely used by US law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;, Browder says the company “anticipates” Photo Ninja will fool the company’s software but can’t guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KHLg1m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Photo Ninja isn’t a silver bullet to beat facial recognition services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aHEWQK"&gt;In part, this is because Clearview AI probably already has a picture of you in its databases, scraped from public sources long ago. As the company’s CEO Hoan Ton-That said in an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/fawkes-tool-protects-photos-from-facial-recognition.html"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year: “There are billions of unmodified photos on the internet, all on different domain names. In practice, it’s almost certainly too late to perfect a technology [that hides you from facial recognition search] and deploy it at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFCMNz"&gt;Browder agrees: “In a perfect world, all images released to the public from Day 1 would be altered. As that is clearly not the case for most people, we recognize this as a significant limitation to the efficacy of our pixel-level changes. Hence, the focal point and intended use case of our tool was to avoid detection from Google Reverse Image Search and TinEye.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U5bOj"&gt;DoNotPay isn’t the first to build this sort of tool. In August 2020, researchers from the University of Chicago’s SAND Lab created an open-source program named Fawkes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353810/facial-recognition-block-ai-selfie-cloaking-fawkes"&gt;performs the same task&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, Browder says DoNotPay’s engineers referenced this work in their own research. But while Fawkes is a low-profile piece of software, very unlikely to be used by the average internet consumer, DoNotPay has a slightly larger reach, albeit one that is still limited to tech-savvy users who are happy to let bots litigate on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM295M"&gt;Tools like this don’t provide a silver bullet to modern privacy intrusions, but as facial recognition and reverse image search tools become more commonly used, it makes sense to deploy at least some protections. Photo Ninja won’t hide you from law enforcement or an authoritarian state government, but it might fool an opportune stalker or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRQ2fS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Orochi V2 wireless gaming mouse has astoundingly long battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Orochi V2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPv-tkN9EDCFqABemC33NTPURS4=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192711/razerorochilede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Id1t33"&gt;Razer’s new $69.99 Orochi V2 is a wireless gaming mouse that promises &lt;em&gt;extremely &lt;/em&gt;long battery life. It can apparently last up to 950 hours on a single AA battery when it’s in Bluetooth mode or up to 425 hours if you toggle its wireless switch to use the 2.4GHz Hyperspeed mode that can deliver lower-latency performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFcwY7"&gt;Alternatively, you can use an AAA battery for a slightly lighter weight. Razer says you’ll get approximately a third of the longevity this way compared to an AA battery. Still, it’s nice that either size of battery can power this mouse for many, many hours. Razer includes a USB-A dongle near the battery slots, which is accessible by lifting up on the mouse’s magnetically attached shell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GHs3rB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Available in white or black, or you can customize it for $20 more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nJwHLo"&gt;Good battery life is useful for any kind of workload, but it’s especially nice to have for gaming, which is what the Orochi V2 was designed for. This mouse feels similar in some ways to the Razer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20947669/razer-wireless-basilisk-gaming-pc-mouse-ultimate-x-hyperspeed-battery-life-price"&gt;Basilisk X Hyperspeed&lt;/a&gt; — another budget-friendly battery-powered mouse with two wireless modes. The Orochi V2 has a textured scroll wheel, angular main mouse buttons that are slightly concave to keep your fingers steady in-game, and two thumb buttons. It’s a smaller mouse overall than the Basilisk X Hyperspeed, yet Razer built it to cater to several grip styles, including claw, palm, and fingertip grips. It is symmetrically designed, though not ambidextrous. A concave thumb rest and the two thumb buttons cater to right-handed gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Orochi V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZrb7MscFmdDJDBUsd9Z2OEvvR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471480/razerorochiv2batteries.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It can hold a AA battery or a AAA battery but not both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EHeTuT"&gt;As for the specs, the Orochi V2 comes in matte black or white and weighs around 71 grams with a AA battery or 64 grams with a AAA battery. It features mechanical mouse switches that have a 60-million click lifespan and uses Razer’s 18K DPI 5G optical sensor. The mouse’s underside features PTFE feet that help it glide easily across a mousepad. Near the scroll wheel, the Orochi V2 has a DPI switcher to adjust sensitivity. It doesn’t have any LEDs, aside from the power indicator next to the DPI-switching button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2RgMN"&gt;The Orochi V2 in black is available at &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-orochi-v2&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRazer-Orochi-V2-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse-Black%2F735296861&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The white-colored model is selling at &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0916MW7CG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Best Buy, and &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-orochi-v2&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a different color or design, Razer is launching a site where you can create an Orochi V2 with a custom look, picking from (according to the company) “over 100” different designs. The customized model costs $89.99 — a $20 premium over the standard option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Orochi V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJlZuron84VBvFMoGxgNPrEu-xc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471469/orochiv2customs.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sampling of the designs you can get on the Orochi V2 for an extra $20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VhMsOb"&gt;The company has also released universal grip tape for your tech. It’s a $9.99 kit filled with different sizes of textured tape that you can stick to a mouse, keyboard, controller, or anything else you want to add some grip to. That’s available on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091DD8FTH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixar’s next animated short expands the complex world of Soul</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="22 vs. Earth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aYJz8fupmrB_lYpvERZlKH8uoFA=/381x0:1667x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192686/22vsEARTH_ONLINE_USE_ss882_1g_cs.sel16.428_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JM2t0b"&gt;From the very beginning of Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, 22 — a soul who refuses to come down to Earth — is cynical. She hates the idea of inhabiting a body or finding her inspiration, instead being content with spending eternity in the “great before,” a space meant to prepare souls for their human lives. Viewers don’t really get a sense of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; she feels that way — but that’s about to change in the upcoming animated short &lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMZLQS"&gt;“I didn’t want the short to be a mirror of what she was like in the feature,” says director Kevin Nolting, who also served as lead editor on &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;. “In looking at what the story would be, the interesting thing for me is what makes her who she is in the feature. This is one of those incidents. In the beginning she was one of those innocent souls; what was the process to make her the cynical soul she is when Joe Gardner shows up? This is just one step in that process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfnUcD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt; is a prequel, though it’s not clear how long before &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; it’s set. In it, 22 — once again voiced by Tina Fey — tries to gather a crew of adorable, innocent souls in order to stage a rebellion of sorts. Things, naturally, don’t go according to plan. Nolting notes that the story takes place around the “mid-point” of 22’s story. “For maybe a few hundred years she’s gone through this series of disappointments, and now she’s going to do something about it,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mkp4UT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I operated on the assumption that people would’ve seen the feature”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yXes6i"&gt;It’s the kind of origin story the team at Pixar considered including in &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, but they ultimately decided against it so they could keep the focus on protagonist Joe Gardner. The team also explored a few different ideas within the &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;universe for the short, including stories based on both Terry — the stuffy accountant from the “great beyond” — and another on Mr. Mittens the therapy cat. But Nolting says 22’s origin “just seemed to be the most natural fit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Y5bIi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJUnC2j9rgo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TLPd8F"&gt;It did introduce some problems, though — namely, figuring out who the audience is. Many of Pixar’s shorts are standalone stories, but given how complex the universe of &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; is, Nolting and the team decided that &lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt; had to be a companion piece. It was just too difficult to explain how its vision of the pre- and afterlife worked in a film that lasts just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5UDtq"&gt;“We struggled on the feature [film] where we had 90 minutes to play with,” explains Nolting. “We struggled with how do you introduce this world, how do you make the rules clear, while making it dramatically interesting. So to have to do that all over again, and in a five minute short, that would eat up all the time. I operated on the assumption that people would’ve seen the feature, they’re familiar with 22, they’re familiar with the mechanics of the &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCVeEb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;22 vs. Earth&lt;/em&gt; will debut on Disney Plus on April 30th, and it manages to capture many of the same feelings of existential angst as &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; — just in a much smaller and cuter package. For Nolting, it was this mix of flavors that made the project so interesting. “I just love the contrast of the innocent and the cynical,” he says. “That was the big appeal for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Complete with software features that make it easy to join parties, record, and share video clips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mbWWFf"&gt;As the high-profile disputes about what content you can play on your iPhone rage on between Apple, Epic Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Google, and Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, a company called Backbone is focusing instead on making sure you get the most out of the games that are currently available. Like Razer did with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;Kishi controller for iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and as other companies have with snap-on controllers of their own, Backbone is introducing one for $100 that it calls the Backbone One. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21525741%2Fbackbones-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy it from Backbone’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JltN1G"&gt;With the controller fully extended, it can fit any iPhone running iOS 13 or later, starting with the iPhone 6S and including the new iPhone 12 lineup. It’s great for Apple Arcade games that support controllers. &lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; play wonderfully with the One. And, for popular games like &lt;em&gt;COD: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; that don’t have controller support switched on from the start, Backbone curates visual tutorials that appear before it launches to walk you through the steps to turn it on in the game’s settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj5Dex"&gt;Since the Backbone One launched, it now works with &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;the xCloud iOS beta&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176273/google-stadia-ios-beta-live-now-mobile-safari-iphone-ipad-cloud-gaming"&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Even playing games like &lt;em&gt;Hades &lt;/em&gt;through the Steam Link app (with my PC connected via Wi-Fi) felt surprisingly natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1n-iRgtg4cNfJG9iV9Qy9fsR30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989942/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analog stick is sized similarly to the ones built into the Joy-Con for Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwtkqN-w96Qpe_ZU3kc0i5S13g4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989940/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The triggers are also similar to those on the Joy-Con, yet these have a more satisfying travel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBU5X5"&gt;Unlike most controller accessories made thus far, the Backbone One is a hybrid of tightly integrated hardware and software. If we’re looking at the hardware, it’s arguably the best of its kind yet. Both sides of this controller have rounded edges that fit naturally in my hand. I praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;design of the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;, but this has a more subtle look that doesn’t cover up as much of your phone’s edges. Each button has a more responsive, tactile click, and the analog sticks feel roughly the same size as Nintendo’s Joy-Con for the Switch. Speaking of the Joy-Con, the One’s rear triggers actually feel &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58jOQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9545130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dT19br"&gt;The Backbone One features passthrough Lightning charging, with support for Lightning headphones if you have a set. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, giving you another way to listen to audio — even if your iPhone doesn’t have the port itself. As for power consumption, Backbone says the One itself demands less power from your iPhone than many wired Lightning earbuds do. I didn’t notice more battery usage during gameplay with the controller attached than I normally would without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4p9F_Zg3IM1_Vae-Y_dIeslxJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989938/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miraculously, the One adds a 3.5mm port, so bust out those wired headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfRkKTciPYMa4kacwguTUQNRdnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989939/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lightning port supports passthrough charging, as well as audio for Lightning EarPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gqUO"&gt;The hardware alone might make it worth the purchase, but the software is what really makes it unique. The One doesn’t require its companion app to work with any iOS game that supports a controller, but using the app turns your iPhone into a game console of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jz4iFB"&gt;Pushing the controller’s orange Backbone button while the One is connected to your phone will open up the Backbone app, which looks like an operating system. There, you’ll find all of your installed games cleanly laid out in an almost tvOS-esque interface. The app also shows new games available for download in the App Store that support controllers. To add games to the Backbone interface, just tap the orange button when you first boot up each new game. This app takes advantage of the iPhone’s excellent haptics to buzz when you flip around the menu, and the company made its own satisfyingly subtle vibration effect that you’ll feel while quickly flying through a bunch of tiles in the interface with the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-efuXwQzJPeyAGX1M8hsh_zbU_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989937/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A full look at what you’ll see when you press the orange Backbone button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru0rOB"&gt;Scroll down a little more in the app, and you’ll find photo and video clips you’ve saved and those from friends. This controller has a dedicated button to let you snap a screenshot in-game, or even record a video clip, which are features that should be familiar to anyone who’s used a modern gaming console. Notably here, though, is that you can press and hold that button for a moment to bookmark key moments on the fly. The Backbone button illuminates a red LED while you’re recording, so it’s easy to see at a glance when you’re live. Backbone handles recording and accessing clips much more elegantly than the Xbox One, PS4, PC, or Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmj6IX"&gt;After a video clip is saved, you can then trim and share the clip in the Backbone app, as well as via iMessage or any social media apps you use. One special thing to note is that Backbone says it can record 1080p clips at 30 frames per second in the HEVC / H.265 codec (supported on the iPhone 7 and newer), so you’ll have higher-quality video without sacrificing as much storage space as other codecs require. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDEF3SLBaPKkIkl_SrS9MuVoyhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989936/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0011.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone button pulses red to indicate when you’re recording the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oSMZng"&gt;Yet another software feature you’ll get with the controller is the ability to create parties and voice chat with friends in the app. These parties operate independently of the game you’re each playing (you don’t even need to be playing a game), so it’s a good way to connect even if you aren’t all into &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, for example. If you’re into recording clips with your friends, the video recording feature will pick up your voice in the mix, along with everyone else’s in the party (indicated by the small orange light near the iPhone’s top bezel in iOS 14). Each participant can choose to mute their mic by double-pressing the left-most button that has three horizontal dots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgmECWkKc--QQXEotbQMAmPsNHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989935/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can start or join a party to voice chat through the Backbone app with other users for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CHeiZ4"&gt;Snapshots, video recording, and organizing parties for voice chat are just a few ways in which Backbone takes the reins in iOS to create a more interesting experience than Apple itself offers to gamers. It also offers rich presence notifications, chiming in with a notification — whether you’re in the Backbone app or not — to tell you when a friend has logged on, or with an invite that you can click to join a party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxoO9S"&gt;On its face, the Backbone One is just a controller — and a very good one, at that. But with software enhancements that take advantage of iOS in some clever ways, Backbone makes the iPhone feel like a bona fide gaming platform that I want to remain a part of. When the hardware and software are all working together, with the ability to easily join up with friends and record clips, the One feels like a gaming experience that somehow beats Apple to the punch of fleshing out its own gaming ambitions. It is no longer just like a phone strapped into a few pieces of plastic but the start of something very special. And for $100, without monthly charges to use its software and party tools, it’s an appealing price if you do a lot of mobile gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BackBone One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IEqzM-niSipNq1wH_IfrUwzzutc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989945/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone One controller supports all the way back to the iPhone 6S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bFdquo"&gt;As well as it works on iOS, the Backbone One seems perhaps better suited to launch on Android, given that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t available on Apple’s App Store. Though, since the One launched, Google Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming services have come to iOS, giving you more content to play than before. Backbone wouldn’t comment when I asked about an Android-specific version of the One. But this iOS controller is already worth the cost of admission if you’re an Apple Arcade subscriber or just enjoy a few one-off games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIGiuB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHPQc6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone confirmed that &lt;/em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;em&gt; is supported by the One. Also, I’ve updated this review to note that Google Stadia and xCloud are both accessible on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_G4X8M_S6lSPjjJ01aHa2-DOPBw=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192532/app_tracking_transparency.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YSB2td"&gt;Apple’s latest iPhone update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, brings a host of new features that customers will likely see and enjoy — better Face ID unlocking when wearing a mask (for Apple Watch users only), new emoji, support for PS5 and Xbox Series X controllers, and more. But the new update also adds a much more important and  controversial new feature: App Tracking Transparency. That’s Apple’s name for a privacy feature that’s shaping up to be the company’s next big fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nivnR1"&gt;The change has been a contentious one. Apple originally announced the feature alongside the rest of iOS 14 last June &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;but has delayed the release until now&lt;/a&gt; to give developers more time to adapt to the changes. It’s finally live, though, setting the stage for what could be a massive fight between the Cupertino tech giant and competitors like Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EygHYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ddAD0r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ad tracking work on iOS before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHQP3A"&gt;Before iOS 14.5, developers could use a host of tools to track user data from within an app. Advertisers could then use it in conjunction with similar data from around the rest of the web to broadly identify information about a user and use that profile to better target them with advertisements (and sell those advertisement opportunities to other companies and businesses that want to focus on their specific marketing segments). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDglwp"&gt;The main tool that’s been available to developers until now has been an Apple-controlled system that’s been around for almost a decade, Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), but developers could also use other third-party tools and methods to cobble together user data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8konp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does App Tracking Transparency change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFboTG"&gt;Technically, App Tracking Transparency alone doesn’t make any seismic changes to how iOS handles ad tracking. Users have been able to opt out of IDFA-based tracking before, but the new update puts the choice front and center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cA4LSg"&gt;It forces developers to give users a choice: once updated to iOS 14.5, every single company that wants to track users and their data across different apps and websites now have to ask permission first using a standardized prompt created by Apple, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rry80Qr7Mx3BYeP6skQNsVKCPmI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472867/Untitled.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vMoguF"&gt;If users say that they’re cool with being tracked (by clicking the “Allow” button) everything works just like it did before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQSOr0"&gt;If they click “Ask app not to track,” though, then that developer can’t track customers using their data in that app, or sell that data to other companies. Not with Apple’s IDFA system, and not with their own systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZzoxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any exceptions or alternatives? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOPxXN"&gt;There are a few exceptions to Apple’s new app tracking rules. First, companies that own multiple apps can track users across those different apps — for example, Facebook can use data it gathers from Instagram to target ads in its main app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz4j61"&gt;And Apple is offering new, in-house tools for developers to use instead. One tool, SKAdNetwork, can tell a company how many times its app was installed after an ad was seen. Another, Private Click Measurement, can tell them how many times users clicked on an ad for a product within an app. Apple says that both of those methods are designed to prevent companies from getting information about a specific user, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkeMqz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are people annoyed about this? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ijBDL"&gt;App Tracking Transparency has been praised by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small"&gt;which called the concept&lt;/a&gt; of making companies ask before they track users on the internet an “obvious baseline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0cwxe"&gt;But not everyone likes the system, and the strongest objections to App Tracking Transparency have been from Facebook. It says Apple’s new system will make it harder and more expensive for ad networks to easily target customers, which in turn will hurt small businesses that rely on highly targeted ad campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5HLD0"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;taken out full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; contesting the changes and argued that Apple’s changes could also hurt websites that rely on lucrative targeted ads to make ends meet, forcing them to subscription services or paywalls for content that used to be free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqDODr"&gt;While Facebook’s main arguments appear altruistic, it’s also important to note that Facebook itself stands to lose out here. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Ffacebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court%3Firclickid%3D3NsQiH1XqxyLTgawUx0Mo38dUkB0YO0p3xAMRo0%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_medium%3Dcpa%26utm_campaign%3D10078-Skimbit%2BLtd.%26utm_term%3Dtheverge.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F27%2F22405474%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, the kinds of ads that Apple’s new rule impacts aren’t a huge part of Facebook’s business model — less than 5 percent of Facebook’s $84 billion annual ad revenue — but it’s still a noticeable chunk of change, especially considering that Facebook’s internal estimates reportedly expect around 80 percent of iOS users to opt out. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwQxjzz2i6KUlQ00H5M-q9f8O4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472878/Untitled_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qabc7d"&gt;Apple is also giving companies a chance to make their case for allowing ad tracking. Developers will have control over &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;to show Apple’s prompt, specifically to give apps like Facebook, NBC News, or BBC a chance to make their case to users about why they should allow tracking. And Facebook is doing just that, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;letter to users&lt;/a&gt; that tries to sell them on the idea of getting more relevant advertisements and supporting small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCw19r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can companies just track me anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfLYzE"&gt;Apple’s prompt disables its own IFDA system on a system level, so if users turn down apps, developers can’t access it. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/"&gt;Apple says that companies&lt;/a&gt; are also “required to respect your choice beyond the advertising identifier” when it comes to other means of tracking user data, and companies that do try to sneak around the rules could be subject to the same consequences as any other developer violating App Store terms of service, up to and including having their app removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVgODg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Apple’s apps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwQjMA"&gt;Apple says that its apps will abide by the new rules, too — as a matter of policy, the company claims that its first-party apps already don’t track users across other apps and websites, which is why you won’t see it appear on Apple’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsLNuh"&gt;That said, Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; still have some tracking that it uses to serve personalized ads within the App Store, Stocks, and Apple News apps. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;As detailed here&lt;/a&gt;, Apple uses information like location, keyboard language settings, device type, OS version, mobile carrier, and more to serve customers more relevant ads within its apps. It also uses account information and past purchases to lump customers into market segments to better target ads within those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svZ1Pm"&gt;The difference is that Apple only uses that information within its own apps, doesn’t link it to additional profiles from third-party sources, and doesn’t sell that data. Apple also has an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074"&gt;additional toggle&lt;/a&gt;, located in “Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Apple Advertising,” to disable that tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l9VcBN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there antitrust concerns?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnhA1Q"&gt;It’s a major tech story in 2021; of course there are antitrust concerns. A group of German advertisers have &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a48d9aa-244b-4945-b2a0-01c68683544a"&gt;already filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; about the new system, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-scores-legal-win-in-france-over-app-privacy-changes-11615971737"&gt;French regulators&lt;/a&gt; shot down an initial antitrust complaint in March, noting that the system “doesn’t appear to be abusive” on Apple’s part.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjahJE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I be spammed by these toggles forever? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZX2mQ"&gt;Nope. Apps can only request once, when you first open them after the update. Developers who don’t want to track you don’t have to show the prompt at all. There’s also a global setting switch that lets users just opt out of all apps by default in Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking, and toggling off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” That menu also allows users to grant (or revoke) permission from apps after the initial prompt has been shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsBf0X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TOuZV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android bug exposed COVID-19 contact tracing logs to preinstalled apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fjod4osZrT7F3sPyapD1KKlmVR4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192462/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NLHCgq"&gt;The Android version of Google and Apple’s COVID-19 exposure notification app had a privacy flaw that let other preinstalled apps potentially see sensitive data, including if someone had been in contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19, privacy analysis firm AppCensus &lt;a href="https://blog.appcensus.io/2021/04/27/why-google-should-stop-logging-contact-tracing-data/"&gt;revealed on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Google says it’s currently rolling out a fix to the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9CuNX"&gt;The bug cuts against repeated promises from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and numerous public health officials that the data collected by the exposure notification program could not be shared outside of a person’s device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="is3v9q"&gt;AppCensus first reported the vulnerability to Google in February, but the company failed to address it, &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/04/27/google-promised-its-contact-tracing-app-was-completely-private-but-it-wasnt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Fixing the issue would be as simple as deleting a few nonessential lines of code, Joel Reardon, co-founder and forensics lead of AppCensus, told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s such an obvious fix, and I was flabbergasted that it wasn’t seen as that,” Reardon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycFRlR"&gt;Updates to address the issue are “ongoing,” Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Markup. &lt;/em&gt;“We were notified of an issue where the Bluetooth identifiers were temporarily accessible to specific system level applications for debugging purposes, and we immediately started rolling out a fix to address this,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY2WLg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;exposure notification system&lt;/a&gt; works by pinging anonymized Bluetooth signals between a user’s phone and other phones that have the system activated. Then, if someone using the app tests positive for COVID-19, they can work with health authorities to send an alert to any phones with corresponding signals logged in the phone’s memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKEbeg"&gt;On Android phones, the contract tracing data is logged in privileged system memory, where it’s inaccessible to most software running on the phone. But apps that are preinstalled by manufacturers get special system privileges that would let them access those logs, putting sensitive contact-tracing data at risk. There is no indication any apps have actually collected that data at this point, Reardon &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/04/27/google-promised-its-contact-tracing-app-was-completely-private-but-it-wasnt"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wn0lk1"&gt;Preinstalled apps have taken advantage of their special permissions before — &lt;a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/03/27/preinstalled-android-software-is-pilfering-your-data-say-researchers/"&gt;other investigations&lt;/a&gt; show that they sometimes harvest data like geolocation information and phone contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cylVRN"&gt;The analysis did not find any similar issues with the exposure notification system on iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsHzGF"&gt;The problem is an implementation issue and not inherent to the exposure notification framework, Serge Egelman, the chief technology officer at AppCensus, said in a statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/v0max/status/1387016943526244356"&gt;posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. It should not erode trust in public health technologies. “We hope the lesson here is that getting privacy right is really hard, vulnerabilities will always be discovered in systems, but that it’s in everyone’s interest to work together to remediate these issues,” Egelman said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $10 on the latest 3D Mario platformer for the Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCCK-zekYlrmrVisrZSDAuMOYyc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192407/Switch_SM3DWBowsersFury_screenshot_28_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s arguably one of the best Mario games, if only because you can turn into a cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="20j3WY"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H9M7LDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-3D-World-Bowser-s-Fury-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-00045496594022%2F381081868&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, you can score a $10 discount on &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch. This discount brings the cost of the Wii U remake, which includes the new &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; open-world expansion, down to $50. Sales on this title have been rare, since it came out recently. If you’ve done everything in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; and are looking for some more 3D-style Mario platforming, this one is worth picking up. Just so you know, this is for the cartridge version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4c23w2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10468219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FQH4Qc"&gt;Affordable and fast rarely go together when you’re talking about M.2 NVMe SSDs, but you can get a 1TB model from SanDisk that possesses both qualities today at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733115867493280374" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Its Ultra model is just $100&lt;/a&gt;, down from its usual $115 price. Best Buy discounts this model on a somewhat frequent basis, and we’ve covered this deal before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8urAs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/hww8re/ssd_sandisk_ultra_1tb_internal_pci_express_30_x4/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Redditors say&lt;/a&gt; that this model lacks DRAM cache, which could make it slower than some pricier models, but it should get the job done for other people who aren’t as discerning. If you’re upgrading from a SATA HDD or SSD, you stand to benefit the most with its speed improvement. As for where you can install it, your motherboard needs an M.2 2280 slot, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RVC6F9Y/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy an enclosure&lt;/a&gt; for this SSD and turn it into a fast external drive for your PC or game console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DQQYX0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10357138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4jkqU"&gt;We shared this deal a couple of times last week, but it bears repeating if you’re after a budget-friendly soundbar. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8532386-13142092?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Ftcl-alto-8-2-1-sound-bar-with-subwoofer-4%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s Alto 8 Plus is $70 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;, and it has a subwoofer built in. Additionally, it features Amazon’s Fire TV 4K hardware built in, so you can get the latest TV shows and movies by plugging it into your TVs HDMI port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="omZUN1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="EbpAPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TWSrSF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Latitude 7320 Detachable is Dell’s newest convertible Surface Pro competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 7320 Detachable with the kickstand extended, angled to the left. The screen displays a blue striped pattern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqIuxNgZ40aG3HedkwdtMFrco6k=/0x203:5358x3775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192311/Latitude_7320_Detachable_front_angled_right.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9v98ZB"&gt;If I asked most people to name a laptop with a detachable keyboard, they’d probably say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;“Surface Pro.”&lt;/a&gt; But there is a number of Windows alternatives out there, for business users and consumers alike. Dell’s newly announced Latitude 7320 Detachable looks to be vying for the top spot in the enterprise market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTXVVn"&gt;Like Dell’s previous Latitude detachable models, the Latitude 7320 Detachable is a powerful Windows tablet with a kickstand and detachable keyboard deck aimed at mobile business users. The 7320’s most significant update is that it includes Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors, up to a Core i7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="somnRb"&gt;The new model also has a 3:2, 1920 x 1280 touch display with support for its own stylus (the 7320 Detachable Active Pen). Dell says this is “the world’s fastest charging stylus pen available on a commercial detachable tablet.” The company claims it will charge up to 100 percent in just 30 seconds and will last for 90 minutes of continuous use on one charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Uc7LcJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dell Latitude 9510 2-in-1 review: this battery means business","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WjCh0A"&gt;Like other modern Latitudes, the 7320 Detachable supports the AI-powered Dell Optimizer software, which improves the device’s performance and battery life over time based on your behavior. Dell claims it’s “the world’s most intelligent business PC.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyqqR6"&gt;The device supports Intel’s vPro platform and can come with Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Enterprise as well as Windows 10 Home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSfQsZ"&gt;The Dell Latitude 7320 Detachable is available for purchase now. Models start at $1,549. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SideQuest’s new Android app can sideload VR games to your Oculus Quest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cE6UcZ2L07mp7Smkj8Vngh7SYI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69192257/akrales_190429_3371_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzKFEC"&gt;SideQuest has launched &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=side.quest.mobile"&gt;an Android app&lt;/a&gt; that lets you do the same neat trick as its desktop app: sideload VR content from outside the official Oculus Store onto your Quest or Quest 2 VR headset. The free app, which releases today, lets you browse SideQuest’s offerings and transfer content over Wi-Fi or a USB cable. That means you don’t need a PC to install VR games, demos, and apps from SideQuest’s community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNFUOu"&gt;SideQuest’s storefront is full of games and apps that are worth trying. Some that I’ve enjoyed recently include &lt;em&gt;Gorilla Tag&lt;/em&gt;, a free game that launched on SideQuest (now available via &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fdeeplink%2F%3Faction%3Dview%26path%3Dapp%2F4979055762136823%26ref%3Doculus_desktop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ App Lab&lt;/a&gt; for early access titles) that’s gotten some well-deserved attention. You play as a gorilla, and you play tag, but the controls and graphical style make it unique and hilarious. Also, there’s &lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/2651/doom3quest"&gt;a free, fan-made mod&lt;/a&gt; that moves your &lt;em&gt;Doom 3&lt;/em&gt; install in its entirety from your Steam folder to the Quest headset, with excellent VR controls and graphics that seem to rival what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361736/doom-3-vr-edition-review-ps4-psvr-aim-controller"&gt;my colleague Sam Byford experienced in the PSVR version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdgt8h"&gt;If you want to get started, this YouTube video below from the Cas and Chary VR channel walks through all of the steps. I highly recommend following along with the video, as the process is easy but not exactly cut-and-dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzYDci"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y37CYAzYfDk?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=114&amp;amp;start=114" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5XXka"&gt;Compared to Oculus’ highly curated Store, SideQuest provides developers an alternative to seeking app approval from Oculus so they can more easily release free projects or list paid ones that link out to a third-party store like &lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; or Patreon. Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262794/oculus-update-app-lab-vr-early-access-sideloading"&gt;Oculus launched App Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which lets developers distribute games through its platform but without a public store listing. You’ll find several of those linked within SideQuest as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIzg9O"&gt;If you have an Android phone and a Quest headset, this is a must-try and an easy way to get more use out of your VR headset.&lt;/p&gt;
