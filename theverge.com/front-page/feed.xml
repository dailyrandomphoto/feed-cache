    <title>Discord is no longer banning r/WallStreetBets — it’s helping them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hK3nzoAWcwhd6yHEdl9KuvMpfI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735747/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="izl1Wn"&gt;Discord is now helping the r/WallStreetBets team moderate its new server. The company originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;banned the group yesterday&lt;/a&gt; due to “hateful and discriminatory content” and revealed it had sent repeated warnings to the team managing the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iDzDm"&gt;Those warnings, for whatever reason, were ignored, but now the r/WallStreetBets team and Discord are working together. Discord staff are actively working with the server’s team to help with moderation. At least one Discord staffer, who is now in the new WallStreetBets server, is also helping with infrastructure problems related to the rapid growth the community is experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZJkXq"&gt;“WallStreetBets members have set up a new server and we are working with them,” says a Discord spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We will welcome the group back so long as they improve their moderation practices and follow our Community Guidelines. We have reached out to the moderators to provide them with support and advice, like we do for many of our large communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JceCGA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Discord has turned into a virtual trade floor with memes, stonks, and chaos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="31iES1"&gt;Discord was left in an awkward position yesterday, after the largely unmoderated server suddenly grew in size and got out of control. It could either let hate speech continue in a community it wouldn’t normally ban or act to shut it down after repeated warnings. The ban appears to have worked to get the r/WallStreetBets moderators to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOL67h"&gt;Hours after the ban, the moderators of the subreddit criticized Discord publicly. “We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don’t get to hang out with your friends anymore,” said the r/WallStreetBets subreddit moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FqbcK"&gt;The new WallStreetBets Discord server currently has 296,000 members, and it continues to grow every second. It has played a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;central role in the subreddit’s ongoing mission&lt;/a&gt; to drive up the price of GameStop and AMC stock. We’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;following the Discord server growth over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;, and while it was full of profanity and racial slurs yesterday, whatever work Discord is doing behind the scenes appears to be working to reduce that content today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc9pqa"&gt;There are now fewer people screaming in calls, using racial slurs, or blasting music to the hundreds listening in. The memes are now mainly emoji and text, rather than images that often included offensive material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwMglC"&gt;We’ve asked Discord exactly what is being done to improve moderation for text-, image-, and audio-based communications and how the company was able to resolve its differences with the WallStreetBets. The company wasn’t able to provide details at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft made a giant climate pledge one year ago — here’s where it’s at now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Offices Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buFoTifosoQt4k7bm3W9yCjQh7Y=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735376/1230784777.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iDzTqO"&gt;One year after pledging to remove all of its historic and future planet-heating emissions within a few decades, Microsoft says it has already slashed its carbon footprint by 6 percent. It’s an incremental change that’s in line with what’s needed globally to address the climate crisis, but there is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cCwnfF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmvLM1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068799/microsoft-carbon-capture-climate-change"&gt;Last January&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pledged to do something that, at the time, was pretty unheard-of: it planned to become carbon &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; by 2030. That gave the company a deadline to capture more planet-heating carbon dioxide than it emits. Not only would it target future emissions, but the company also pledged that, by 2050, it would remove the equivalent of all the carbon dioxide it’s released since being founded in 1975. It made those promises even though the technology to make it all happen doesn’t yet exist at commercial scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUkQXL"&gt;Now, we’re beginning to get a glimpse of what’s actually feasible for Microsoft to achieve. Some of the reduction in climate pollution it accomplished last year was a result of the economic toll of the pandemic. Microsoft will need to continue making cuts year on year without the help of a global crisis. The sustainability report it released today also showed how much the company can actually rely on carbon-removal technologies — which, at the moment, is not very much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGRldy"&gt;When companies set goals to become carbon neutral, or carbon negative in Microsoft’s case, the company &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; saying it will stop pumping out greenhouse gases altogether. What it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do is cancel out some portion of its greenhouse gases by paying other companies and nonprofit organizations to trap and store carbon dioxide. The tricky part of these corporate sustainability pledges is that it’s not usually clear how much carbon dioxide the company plans to cut altogether versus how much it will continue to pollute and then pay to remove from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L34FTJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today there is no real existing carbon removal ecosystem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUBsUq"&gt;In Microsoft’s case, we now know that the company plans to cut its emissions “by more than half” by 2030. That implies that, in the future, it intends to rely on carbon-removal schemes to make up for almost half of all its carbon emissions. In its &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Mxso"&gt;2020 fiscal year&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft released 11,164,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Since making its carbon-removal pledge last January, the company says it purchased contracts to capture 1.3 million metric tons of CO2, over 11 percent of its total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vf5Btl"&gt;Companies can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by funding reforestation projects or technology that captures the greenhouse gas from the air. So far, Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/01/28/sustainability-year-progress-decade-action/"&gt;relied mostly on forests&lt;/a&gt; to suck up and store its carbon emissions. Less than 1 percent of the carbon Microsoft said it removed from the atmosphere last year was seized through emerging direct air capture technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tg9SR"&gt;“Today there is no real existing carbon removal ecosystem and the world must build a new market on an unprecedented scale and timeline, from nearly scratch,” Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/01/28/one-year-later-the-path-to-carbon-negative-a-progress-report-on-our-climate-moonshot/#_ftn1"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post today. Microsoft started a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund last year to accelerate the growth of that “ecosystem,” but much more will be needed to make carbon removal a successful strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIhUAA"&gt;Companies relying on forests to erase their carbon footprint comes with pitfalls, too. Although the strategy is now being folded into the umbrella term of “carbon removal,” it’s typically been described in the past as carbon “offsets.” Offsets have gotten a bad rap because &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into them have shown that they haven’t actually succeeded in permanently trapping carbon dioxide. Companies can claim that they’re canceling out their effect on the climate, when in reality, they’re not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q8eAKi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not the rocket that will take us to the Moon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qRPGfn"&gt;Microsoft funded three conservation projects through the Nature Conservancy, which was the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; last year. Some of Nature Conservancy’s forest preservation projects allowed companies to claim they were shrinking their carbon footprints, when in reality, the forests were not threatened — so there was no additional benefit they were adding to the climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2XNs9"&gt;Microsoft acknowledges that its reliance on these kinds of conservation projects is a “big weakness” in its initial work. “Reflecting the state of the market today and our immediate need for carbon removal, nearly all the carbon removal solutions we are purchasing are short-term and nature-based,” Smith wrote. “This is not the rocket that will take us to the Moon. The world needs to invent substantially stronger technology-based solutions than are available today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGmdt3"&gt;The world, including Microsoft, also needs to double down on efforts to stop polluting in the first place. Microsoft has laid out some plans on how it will do that. It’s tying executives’ pay to their performance on sustainability initiatives. The company said it will also work with suppliers to cut down their pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1LW8yX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft needs to double down on efforts to stop polluting in the first place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk4NqX"&gt;It also incentivizes teams within the company to come up with ways to make their products more sustainable. One notable result from the program: the company updated the Xbox to reduce the power it uses when it’s in “standby mode” from 15W to less than 2W. (Side note: &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/noah-horowitz/latest-game-consoles-environmental-winners-or-losers"&gt;settings still make a really big difference&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to making the console as energy efficient as possible, according to the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wa4wGmhhe5XriaaSkHgj2zb_rVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21880659/6_390Microsoft_0374_1920x1280_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft sunk a data center to the bottom of the Scottish sea in 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qQXK7Y"&gt;Microsoft will also have to figure out how to reduce emissions from its data centers, which suck up a lot of energy and are a vital part of its business. It’s already looked into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436746/microsoft-project-natick-data-center-server-underwater-cooling-reliability"&gt;storing servers under the sea&lt;/a&gt;, which could save energy by keeping the servers cool naturally without requiring refrigeration. Data centers on land can also use up a lot of water as part of their cooling systems. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448896/microsoft-environmental-pledge-water-scarcity-data-centers"&gt;pledged last year&lt;/a&gt; to conserve and replenish water where it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyP6q4"&gt;Microsoft’s goal of halving emissions by 2030 falls in line with science-based targets. In order to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, the global economy will need to roughly halve emissions by 2030, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;landmark report&lt;/a&gt; by leading climate scientists. By 2050, the world will need to gut emissions to near zero. Carbon removal may offer a small assist, but to get to the Moon, the heavy lifting will have to come from elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is testing clips on live streams and VODs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3XqbaSQbtRVshlRyA2KsN3hgY4=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735325/youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVCqa1"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/95526465"&gt;is introducing clipping&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to make short clips of live streams or videos — starting today with a small group of creators. Those clips can be anywhere between five and 60 seconds in length and will have a new URL associated with them. Creators and viewers will be able to create clips by clicking on the clip icon, though the feature is currently limited to desktop and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9LNE4"&gt;It’s a smart move from YouTube, because clipping is something of a live-streaming industry standard. You can more easily share live video content via a short video clip that can be passed around social media, rather than requiring viewers to skim through a potentially hourslong stream. Every platform from Twitch to the dearly departed site Mixer has decided that it’s something their creators need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6PrDZu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we are launching an experimental version of Clips on YouTube. Check out videos on the Creator Insider channel and test it out yourself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clips are 5-60 sec, shareable, segments of content (Live/VOD) that live on top of the original video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info: &lt;a href="https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj"&gt;https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DVWNQ2BoEx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DVWNQ2BoEx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lester (@Chen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Chen/status/1354837070460555264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94ajXm"&gt;YouTube adding the feature is just another signal that the online video titan intends to beef up its live-streaming operation. As is the conventional wisdom in streamer spaces, clips help channels grow. A good clip that goes viral can bring in a huge influx of new viewers — and in streaming, where visibility is a big part of creating a sustainable income, that’s half the battle. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AOC and others call for investigation into Robinhood’s GameStop freeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Postmaster General To Testify To House Committee About Department’s Ability To Handle Mail In Voting" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GhKMnI6YzDtGV3_BUfqMyrQ80n8=/0x0:4629x3086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735142/1228188159.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Williams-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLwuX8"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called on Congress to investigate the Robinhood app after it banned small investors from buying stock in companies like GameStop. Over the last week, Reddit users have rushed to buy the bemoaned video game retailer’s stock, inflating its price in what some are calling the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1352683263001812992?s=20"&gt;squeeze of a lifetime&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eg8HrC"&gt;In a Thursday tweet, Ocasio-Cortez called Robinhood’s decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock in companies like GameStop and Blackberry “unacceptable,” and that’d she’d “support a hearing if necessary.” Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, which &lt;a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/about/jurisdiction.htm"&gt;has jurisdiction to oversee the stock market&lt;/a&gt; and “securities and exchanges” more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQkLNZ"&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) retweeted her message, saying “Fully agree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8ZgM0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted the House Financial Services Committee for comment on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Thursday, but it didn’t immediately respond. When reached for comment, the Senate Finance Committee directed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to the Senate Banking Committee. The Senate Banking Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9UBSYD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fully agree.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/rW38zfLYGh"&gt;https://t.co/rW38zfLYGh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkbdjR"&gt;Other progressive Democrats have also made statements on the GameStop shorts, calling for further regulation of the financial industry. “It’s long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs — and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1IiAA"&gt;Silicon Valley progressive Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) put out a statement Thursday saying, “We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,” he continued. “We need more regulation and equality in the markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVAgCy"&gt;Later on Thursday, Khanna retweeted Ocasio-Cortez, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1354835649250078722?s=20"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;, “We need an investigation into RobinhoodApp’s decision and who influenced that. And this shows the need for a financial transaction tax on hedge fund shorting and SEC regulations on short selling practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjej19"&gt;It’s unclear if Congress will move forward with an investigation into Robinhood or the GameStop situation at large. At a press conference Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said “interesting, isn’t it?” when asked about the GameStop shorts, but did not forecast any actions Congress planned to take regarding the situation. The committees with jurisdiction have yet to make any major announcements either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2poBYf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 1/28/20 at 1:35PM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article previously said that Reddit users “shorted” GameStop stock. This was incorrect; instead, users rushed to buy the stock, inflating its price. The Verge regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxGGmj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5cc3a2257d544b4d45f0448d6de0ce29&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple retakes second place in smartphone shipment rankings as sanctions bite Huawei</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-6LsWukqqwnnP59jaU2neKAvi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734773/akrales_201018_4238_0435.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pesyUj"&gt;Apple overtook Huawei to reclaim its spot as the second-bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world in 2020, according to new research reports from &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung was still the leading seller in terms of number of smartphones shipped, while Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo took the next three spots, according to Counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwdPw2"&gt;It was just under a year ago that the same research analysts reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;Huawei had overtaken Apple&lt;/a&gt; to take second place in 2019. But since then, US trade sanctions seem to have hit Huawei hard. The Chinese company’s smartphone shipments were 21 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Counterpoint, and Huawei dropped out of the top five entirely in the fourth quarter of the year. It’s the first time in six years Huawei hasn’t been in the top five, Canalys notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmUFPMliIJ3tH4ZYKyDlfXYvSGY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265688/msedge_yHAlKBDDrF.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020" target="_blank"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s smartphone shipments dropped out of the top five in Q4 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QAHESd"&gt;Although Huawei was still able to hold on to the number three spot overall, thanks to domestic sales in China (where it reportedly shipped 70 percent of its phones in 2019), Xiaomi seized the opportunity to expand internationally and saw shipments increase by 17 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. However, the fastest-growing smartphone brand in 2020 was reportedly Realme, which shipped 65 percent more phones than it did in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhyalT"&gt;Apple’s gains were more modest, increasing by 3 or 5 percent year over year depending on whether you ask Counterpoint Research or Canalys. The latter notes that Apple shipped the most iPhones ever in the fourth quarter of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q13uhFOoULy8NsTeIXRBNF4PxbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265691/msedge_cg52VaBVpy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/" target="_blank"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterpoint Research reports that Apple overtook Huawei last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HxLL2G"&gt;Although it’s still the bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world, both reports suggest that Samsung’s smartphone business is losing market share. Both Canalys and Counterpoint say its shipments fell 14 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s still around 50 million smartphones ahead of second place Apple, but the gap appears to be narrowing. Counterpoint says that the South Korean electronics giant is facing stiff competition from Apple at the high end of the market and from Chinese manufacturers in the midrange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9173w"&gt;Overall, the entire smartphone market was reportedly down compared to 2019. Canalys reports that shipments were down 7 percent, while Counterpoint reports a bigger 10 percent decline. Counterpoint blames the pandemic and resulting lockdowns for the drop, but notes that shipments began to pick up in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After buy ban, GameStop hypebeasts are looking for a Robinhood alternative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tB_SWRTdr9yrUDqwCWGKo4Dh5WE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734726/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Smd00e"&gt;In the wake of Robinhood’s surprise trading block, a new class of Reddit investors are looking for apps that will let them plow their money into their favorite stocks. On Thursday morning, Robinhood announced that it would temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;block investors&lt;/a&gt; from purchasing or trading companies including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond, and Nokia, all of which have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;unexpected rallies over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;. But for the online communities that fueled those rallies, the block is being treated as an outright betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCypZ"&gt;Discussion about switching ramped up on Twitter and in investment discords after Robinhood halted buying and trading on stock, citing “recent volatility” in the market with the aforementioned stock as the reason it prevented additional trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HG1HjA"&gt;Since the decision, Robinhood’s app on the App Store has received thousands of one-star reviews as a form of practice known as review bombing. On the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, angry Robinhood users are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x130/class_action_against_robinhood_allowing_people_to/"&gt;calling for a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; because “allowing people to only sell is the definition of market manipulation,” according to one post. There’s even a new subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/"&gt;specifically for suing the company&lt;/a&gt;. Another Robinhood &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewNiss/status/1354821478613540864"&gt;user tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that after years of being on the platform, the move felt like a “slap to the face,” adding “to be regulated in a time of absolute prime opportunities is an embarrassment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDJVPq"&gt;On Twitter, beloved rapper and Fyre Fest promoter Ja Rule did not mince words: “Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmLLDl"&gt;Robinhood has been central to much of the chaos within the financial sector over the last few days. Investors from r/WallStreetBets or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;its private Discord server&lt;/a&gt; used the personal finance app to inflate GameStop and other stocks as a blow against Wall Street hedge funds. But now that Robinhood has taken steps to stem the rally, the r/WallStreetBets community feels betrayed — and is already looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FoWbo1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwG0Kz"&gt;The list of brokerages that have stopped allowing trades and buys of the aforementioned stock continue to grow: Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354828729713881091"&gt;and WeBull&lt;/a&gt; have all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354828730674372610"&gt;halted trading&lt;/a&gt;. TD Ameritrade has placed “restrictions on &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; transactions in $GME and other securities,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those restrictions “may include actions like increasing margin requirements, or limiting certain types of transactions, like short sales and those that may involve unlimited risk,” the spokesperson added. After publication, Public, an app similar to Robinhood, also stopped its users from trading and buying certain stock. The company issued a statement on Twitter, noting, “Our clearing firm, Apex Holdings, has decided to halt the buying of $KOSS, $GME, and $AMC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoShqP"&gt;“We disagree with this decision and are working hard for our members to resolve the issue,” the statement continues. “We’ll provide updates here as they happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxnXvm"&gt;Prior to the halt, Public continued to allow buys and trades without restriction, although the app “added Safety Labels to help inform and provide context to our users before they make a trade,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hgz8G1"&gt;For Robinhood competitors like Public, it was a golden opportunity for a short period. In fact, Public even doubled the free stock slice &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/public/status/1354810368191733770"&gt;for member referrals&lt;/a&gt;. Popular YouTube personality Casey Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354794425528934405"&gt;tweeted on Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt; just after the Robinhood halting began that “everyone complaining about @RobinhoodApp delisting GameStop and I’m over here on @public about to get Bill Gates rich.” He later said that no one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795210765606913"&gt;should take investment advice from him&lt;/a&gt; and that he’s an investor in Public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;“Also im an investor in public and i hope this ridiculous behavior from Robinhood brings attention to superior companies (like Public),” Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795211713470467"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xstnn2"&gt;Switching to a competitor will still add some friction — and might cost investors valuable time in an exceptionally volatile situation. When creating an account on Public, for instance people may have to wait a few days for their application to be approved, according to a message that appears during the signup process. If people are trying to get in on GameStop and AMC while the magic rally is still in effect, that delay might defeat the purpose — although at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter had their account approved in the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YZqB5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u78AiF"&gt;Most apps also allow investors to &lt;a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/2673094-can-i-transfer-another-investment-account-to-public"&gt;transfer their portfolios&lt;/a&gt; from other brokerages, including Robinhood, which could be faster. But there’s still likely to be a significant delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsfbgR"&gt;Webull is another investment app, and the FAQ states that “in most cases, account application is approved automatically.” Webull’s website also states that people can trade in the same day if “you deposit via ACH before 4:00 pm on a trading day” — basically, if funds are transferred from something like a bank to Webull. The site also states, however, that people “will get a provisional credit (up to $1000 depending on the incoming deposit) of buying power after your deposit,” which gives people “provisional buying power to trade.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XbLN8"&gt;Transferring stocks from one app to another, or flocking to another app to buy stocks, seems tedious — but as long as it’s unclear when Robinhood and other brokerages will allow purchases, GameStop’s new stockholders are left with no other choice. At the time of publication, GameStop’s stock was sitting at $155 — down from yesterday’s high of $468, but still more than triple where the stock was last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AVdH3"&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich,” popular YouTube creator Ricky “FaZe Banks” Bengston &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Banks/status/1354786829388500998"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “You guys fkn blew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjCjvW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 28th, 1:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story has been updated to note that Public stopped allowing users to buy and trade certain stock. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDul1v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 28th, 1:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said that TD Ameritrade halted purchases of certain stock. TD Ameritrade still allows stock to be bought, but there are restrictions in place, like increasing margin requirements. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Parler down, QAnon moves onto a ‘free speech’ TikTok clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJaQaBGiiPD0KJU3xLkNLW7vHk0=/69x0:444x250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734686/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clapper&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7b6NKq"&gt;After this month’s deadly attack at the Capitol, QAnon has been widely banished from the internet. Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have all banned Q-related content, and the right’s favored platform, Parler, has been forced offline for weeks. But it hasn’t all disappeared. A new platform called Clapper, a “free-speech” TikTok clone, is becoming a home for QAnon followers.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD5LiA"&gt;Clapper launched last July as a “Free Speech Short Video” app — it’s basically TikTok, but the company promises a lot less moderation. In the six months since its launch, the app has been downloaded over half a million times, with a considerable amount of that growth coming in just the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yjqtb"&gt;Once you download Clapper, you can start scrolling through a “For You” page that works similarly to TikTok’s. But instead of seeing popular creators like Charli D’Amelio, the feed looks like if &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/youtube-suspends-oann-violating-its-covid-19-policy-n1248845"&gt;One America News Network&lt;/a&gt; made a short-form video app. There are airsoft and fishing videos with people calling themselves “patriots,” but also plenty of anti-vax misinformation and videos calling out Democrats as “pedophiles.” According to Clapper’s website, #trump2020 and other political hashtags are some of the most popular on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dmDR2Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While the app might have been meant as a semi decent TikTok clone, it’s now taken the place of Parler”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="twvXL8"&gt;“Don’t be fooled,” one review read on the Google Play Store. “While the app might have been meant as a semi decent TikTok clone, it’s now taken the place of Parler in terms of [QAnon] and Bigots taking it over as their own little echochamber. If you enjoy bigotry and conspiracy theorists, by all means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSCNFp"&gt;Some QAnon influencers have built sizable followings on the app, playing off hashtags like #WWG1WGA and #thestorm that would be blocked on Instagram or Twitter. One user, named Josh Sardam, has made videos supporting Q-Anon adjacent Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and made comments about individuals being a part of the “NWO,” or new world order. In another private messaging group titled “2021 The Great Awakening,” Sardam shares memes and theories with the closest fans, some of whom give Patreon-style donations to support the work. All told, Sardam reaches nearly 30,000 followers on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKiZxQ"&gt;For every user turned off by the presence of Q content, there are others who are drawn in. Like Parler and Gab before it, Clapper has become a popular home for conservatives who disagree with the moderation decisions of large tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and especially TikTok. Scrolling through Clapper-related hashtags on TikTok, like #joinclapper, there are dozens of videos of users announcing their transition to the TikTok free-speech clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nL82QW"&gt;“Clapper’s almost exactly like TikTok, but it’s got better content and they don’t censor people like a bunch of communists,” one TikTok user, with the username @your_favoritebiker, posted last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LC6jWH"&gt;Clapper CEO and co-founder Edison Chen realizes a lot of the app’s recent growth has come from QAnon believers and right-wing political accounts, but he isn’t losing sleep over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGI2go"&gt;“There are lots of conservatives and political people,” Chen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think they feel less censorship here and they’re kicked out from the other social media platforms. So they come to us, and it brings some opportunity to us but [it] also comes with some challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09803i"&gt;Clapper is based in Dallas, Texas, Chen said, and has fifteen employees. Users upload “thousands” of videos a day, Chen said, and Clapper has only two US employees and ten outside of the country who field content reports. In a follow-up email, Chen said that Clapper targets millennial and boomer users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5uvZp"&gt;When asked if Clapper allows QAnon content on its platform, Chen first told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that moderation largely relies on reports from its users, but content that could incite violence is prohibited. Later, Chen said that Clapper had “identified” several QAnon-related users and was conducting an investigation into whether they violated the app’s community standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70ktyp"&gt;“Some of the users on our app are talking a lot about QAnon, and we are still working on it to further investigate if they truly are against our community guidelines,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCF68V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Read our official announcement and response to the events at the U.S. Capitol. &lt;a href="https://t.co/KnOT4Y8vDA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KnOT4Y8vDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Clapper (@NewsClapper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NewsClapper/status/1348308885304733697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8fqROi"&gt;Earlier this month, Clapper content helped the FBI identify an Ohio man who attended the Capitol riot. Justin Stoll was arrested by the FBI and charged with making online threats and witness tampering on January 15th, &lt;a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/wilmington-ohio-man-arrested-fbi-participation-us-capitol-riot-1-15-2021"&gt;according to ABC 6 News in Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. In videos posted to Clapper, Stoll made threatening comments before the riot, saying “Basically, if you are an enemy combatant, you will be shot on sight I know this is the end-all flag.” Stoll also posted videos outside of the Capitol alongside other rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yx1Vrn"&gt;Clapper responded to the deadly attack at the Capitol &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NewsClapper/status/1348308885304733697?s=20"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; on January 10th saying, “As many Americans, we watched in horror as a violent mob breached the US Capitol in the name of ‘political protest.’ In the aftermath of these events, we want to re-emphasize that the Clapper platform has a zero tolerance on violence of any kind, as well as individuals who incite violence for personal or political gains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uv1ts"&gt;Chen said that Clapper did not set out to be a right-wing conservative political platform, and that the company wants to highlight ordinary users’ lives. “Today’s social media platforms push most traffic to big creators while the creator in the middle and the normal user don’t get the opportunity to speak and be seen,” Chen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1QO3i"&gt;Following &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Wednesday interview with Chen, he sent a follow-up email including examples of the less political side of Clapper, highlighting accounts from a &lt;a href="https://newsclapper.com/FatPanda208?r=E7JZQG0PKQ"&gt;truck driver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://newsclapper.com/thegaryjonesjr?r=E7JZQG0PKQ"&gt;country music singer&lt;/a&gt;, and a “&lt;a href="https://newsclapper.com/AttaGirl_Axes?r=E7JZQG0PKQ"&gt;girl with axes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5pSwI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open Roads is a game about riffling through the past while your mom watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHM3fndX65Ep2EpKjldDSpRyBPs=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734545/ss_a408fa5bef976c37712481bf5f628f526802df2a.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1gqgv"&gt;In Steve Gaynor’s attic, there is a box that does not belong to him. He bought his Portland home from a family who put the house up for sale after the death of its elderly owner. Months later, Gaynor and his wife discovered a cardboard box full of letters and other artifacts from a stranger’s life. “There was this backstory about this person who had been part of this family that was all contained inside this one cardboard box,” Gaynor said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcJsyK"&gt;It’s an anecdote almost too good to be believed: a co-founder of Fullbright, a studio known for pioneering “walking sim” games, living out his very own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/15/4621514/gone-home-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style adventure. Gaynor wondered not just about the box’s owner, but the possibilities of these found items: “How can we express that feeling of discovering those things together?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TxEab"&gt;The answer might just be Fullbright’s new project, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167445/fullbright-open-roads-the-game-awards-keri-russell"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a mother-daughter road trip starring Keri Russell as mom Opal and Kaitlyn Dever as teen Tess. Announced late last year, &lt;em&gt;Open Roads &lt;/em&gt;is a first-person exploration game where players dig through abandoned places for clues about a family member’s past. “It’s a game that in a lot of ways continues our tradition of what we have been doing at Fullbright,” says Gaynor. It’s a story-driven experience, where the mystery is personal and built around relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCU1dXXCAqdWeLLG-hfT7e9tw2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265600/ss_a3aa4fb682b940da1896c5e14a91dc3cf82cd2cd.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6YhPQq"&gt;But where past games allowed the player to be a true voyeur, left to riffle through personal objects and history at their leisure, &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt; has perhaps the most diligent of all possible companions: your mom. “You can get away with a lot when it’s just you being in the space,” says Gaynor. “There’s this sort of permission to be transgressive in a certain way in our other games, where we kind of say it’s okay to dig deep into other people’s personal stuff. I think in some cases in &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;, it just becomes part of the conversation.” Opal will have her own opinions about what you find, as well as history to share through her eyes. How and why she interjects, and what that says about her perspective, as well as her relationship to Tess, is part of the game’s fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vkpof"&gt;And then there’s Tess, the player character. &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt; is Fullbright’s first venture into playing with branching dialogue, a choice that Gaynor says serves to express who Tess is, rather than impact the game’s outcome. “You’re kind of on a path along this journey with Opal, but within that you have a lot of control as Tess with how you want to relate to your mom,” he says. How confrontational or supportive a player wants to be, for example, is their prerogative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRjIvM"&gt;In the past decade or so, game narratives have grown to love the so-called sad dad — watching figures like Joel from &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; become a surrogate father to Ellie, or &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s Kratos on a journey with his son. But mothers in games have yet to be represented with such complexity or even commonality. Those relationships can be fickle and emotionally convoluted. In other words, they’re ripe for engaging stories. “What’s more interesting to us to put on screen? What is a story that’s not getting told as much?” says Gaynor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="53bV5N"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGngJgAXM6Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrr7O"&gt;Influenced by stories like &lt;em&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/em&gt; and girlhood experiences from members of the team, including Gaynor’s co-writer and wife, Rachel, Fullbright wanted to pay homage to experiences they’ve had in their own lives. &lt;em&gt;Open Roads &lt;/em&gt;is a matriarchal story, with Tess and Opal digging into the unknown life of Tess’ grandmother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NFoMc"&gt;“I feel like there’s this moment in all of our lives where you have the grandparent that passes away,” says Gaynor. “In being exposed to the stuff they’ve left behind and having to sort through it, you discover things about them that maybe you never knew or that you’d forgotten about.” Part of that means playing with the idea of an unreliable narrator. Memories get jumbled, and personal experience colors recollection: “Can I find the real truth through the exploration that we’re doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xe5ll2"&gt;As for the attic box, Gaynor hasn’t been able to find the family to which it belongs. “It’s not ours to do something with,” he says, unwilling to throw it away. It serves as a reminder of what it felt like to put together the pieces of someone’s life with a loved one. “We wanted to pay homage … to that experience of finding out more about who those people really were, maybe after the point where you’re really able to talk to them about it,” he says of &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;. “Maybe it makes [the player] think about their own experience with those moments in their life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfRRIN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf8Iwl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtqox3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kHo1Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Oversight Board overturns hate speech and pandemic misinformation takedowns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AA9L5yBKvYRr-TwghAkRcg3QVXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734307/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0ZI1U"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board has issued its first round of rulings, upholding one removal and overturning four decisions involving hate speech, nudity, and misinformation. Together, the rulings take an expansive view of what users can post under the current policies, based on concerns about vague rules and protecting freedom of expression online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l94zG4"&gt;The Oversight Board — composed of experts outside Facebook — accepted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;first set of cases&lt;/a&gt; in December. While the original slate included six incidents, a user in one case &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-KBHZS8BL/"&gt;proactively deleted their post&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the decision moot. Facebook has pledged to follow its rulings within seven days and respond to recommendations for new policies within 30 days. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-oversight-boards-first-decisions/"&gt;In a response to the rulings&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook said it had already restored all the content in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NADL0w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One case objected to Facebook’s automated takedown system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9M5USU"&gt;The five cases covered posts across four continents. In Brazil, the board &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-KBHZS8BL/"&gt;ruled in favor&lt;/a&gt; of a woman whose Instagram post about breast cancer was automatically removed for nudity. Facebook had already restored the photo, but the board objected to the initial removal, saying the fully automated decision “indicates the lack of proper human oversight which raises human rights concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VZWm7"&gt;Two other cases show the bounds of what the board considers hate speech. &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/436612660860568-oversight-board-upholds-facebook-decision-case-2020-003-fb-ua/"&gt;A panel upheld&lt;/a&gt; Facebook removing a Russian post with a demeaning slur against Azerbaijani people. But it &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/773985406543781-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2020-002-fb-ua/"&gt;overturned a decision&lt;/a&gt; in Myanmar, saying that while the post “might be considered offensive, it did not reach the level of hate speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYzqJa"&gt;The post was written in Burmese, and the decision was based on some fine translation differences. Facebook initially interpreted it as saying “[there is] something wrong with Muslims psychologically,” but a later translation rendered it as “[specific] male Muslims have something wrong in their mindset,” which was deemed “a commentary on the apparent inconsistency between Muslims’ reactions to events in France and in China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eccuU7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A post about Muslims in Myanmar was considered “offensive” but “did not reach the level of hate speech”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1VPTSG"&gt;As the Facebook board acknowledges, Myanmar is in the grips of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/23/myanmar-is-still-committing-genocide-against-rohingya-says-rights-group"&gt;an ongoing genocide&lt;/a&gt; against the Rohingya Muslim minority, incited partly through inflammatory Facebook posts. However, it declared that “statements referring to Muslims as mentally unwell or psychologically unstable are not a strong part of this rhetoric,” and “while the post might be considered pejorative or offensive towards Muslims, it did not advocate hatred or intentionally incite any form of imminent harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgmchb"&gt;Other decisions hinge on Facebook explaining its policies badly, rather than the specific content of the post. &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/141077647749726-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2020-005-fb-ua/"&gt;A US-based post&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, compared a quote from Nazi propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels to American political rhetoric. Facebook determined it violated hate speech policies because it didn’t explicitly condemn Goebbels, but “Facebook is not sufficiently clear that, when posting a quote attributed to a dangerous individual, the user must make clear that they are not praising or supporting them,” the board said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="D9ITgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board still hasn’t decided whether Facebook could ban Trump&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gqk6sT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/325131635492891-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2020-006-fb-fbr/"&gt;Another case&lt;/a&gt;, from France, referred falsely to hydroxychloroquine as a “cure” for COVID-19. But the reference was part of a comment about government policies, not an encouragement to take the drug, and the board said this didn’t rise to the level of causing “imminent harm.” The board said that Facebook’s rules about medical misinformation were “inappropriately vague and inconsistent with international human rights standards,” and it’s encouraged Facebook to publish clearer guidelines about what counts as “misinformation,” as well as a transparency report about how it has moderated COVID-19-related content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2TIcX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook suggests it won’t take a softer line on COVID-19 misinformation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tuwH0j"&gt;Facebook says it will apply the precedent from these rulings to similar content on the network, although it didn’t give a specific number of posts that were affected. It’s still formulating policy changes, but it discussed the medical misinformation case specifically, saying that its takedown approach “will not change” while the pandemic is ongoing. However, it plans to publish updated COVID-19-related policies soon. “It is critical for everyone to have access to accurate information, and our current approach in removing misinformation is based on extensive consultation with leading scientists, including from the CDC and WHO,” writes content policy vice president Monika Bickert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jh17sS"&gt;The Oversight Board says it will soon take on a new slate of cases, which can be drawn from user appeals or referred directly by Facebook. It will also open a public comment period for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;highest-profile case so far&lt;/a&gt;: whether Facebook and Instagram should indefinitely suspend former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0JCmM"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board — effectively a “supreme court” for the social network — was criticized for a slow rollout after its initial announcement last year. A separate group of activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/29/21472092/real-facebook-oversight-board-stunt-activism-limitations"&gt;calling themselves the “Real Facebook Oversight Board”&lt;/a&gt; have also called it too narrowly focused on putting content back online, rather than addressing whether Facebook should moderate &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; strictly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUCnsq"&gt;Stanford Cyber Policy Center &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/persily/status/1354806193005293570"&gt;co-director Nate Persily noted&lt;/a&gt; that individual decisions aren’t the only thing at stake in this set of rulings. “The results in these decisions are less important than the signals/precedent set for how the board will operate, how it considers its jurisdiction, what info about [Facebook] and its posts will be revealed in the decisions, and how ambitious the Board will be in checking Facebook,” he tweeted after the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lccNSA"&gt;Similar to a national Supreme Court, the Oversight Board’s decisions are supposed to help clarify Facebook’s complicated rules. Unlike a democratic nation, however, the company can easily change its own moderation policies, and Facebook is under no legal obligation to abide by the board’s rulings.&lt;/p&gt;
