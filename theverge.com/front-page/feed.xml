    <title>GitHub’s automatic coding tool rests on untested legal ground</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItMtla"&gt;Just days after GitHub announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555777/github-openai-ai-tool-autocomplete-code"&gt;new Copilot tool&lt;/a&gt;, which generates complementary code for programmers’ projects, web developer Kyle Peacock &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kylpeacock/status/1410749018183933952"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; an oddity he had noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKOT13"&gt;“I love to learn new things and build things,” the algorithm wrote, when asked to generate an About Me page. “I have a &amp;lt;a href=“https://github.com/davidcelis”&amp;gt; Github&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeEanH"&gt;While the About Me page was supposedly generated for a fake person, that link goes to the GitHub profile of David Celis, who &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can confirm is not a figment of Copilot’s imagination. Celis is a coder and GitHub user with popular repositories, and even formerly worked at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AUzXo4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not surprised that my public repositories are a part of the training data for Copilot”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YYRQBj"&gt;“I’m not surprised that my public repositories are a part of the training data for Copilot,” Celis told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding that he was amused by the algorithm reciting his name. But while he doesn’t mind his name being spit out by an algorithm that &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;parrots its training data&lt;/a&gt;, Celis is concerned at the copyright implications of GitHub scooping up any code it can find to better its AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbbGo3"&gt;When GitHub announced Copilot on June 29, the company said that the algorithm had been trained on publicly available code posted to GitHub. Nat Friedman, GitHub’s CEO, has written on forums like &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27678354"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the company is legally in the clear. “Training machine learning models on publicly available data is considered fair use across the machine learning community,” the Copilot page says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ais6Cu"&gt;But the legal question isn’t as settled as Friedman makes it sound — and the confusion reaches far beyond just GitHub. Artificial intelligence algorithms only function due to massive amounts of data they analyze, and much of that data comes from the open internet. An easy example would be &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/"&gt;ImageNet&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the most influential AI training dataset, which is entirely made up of publicly available images that ImageNet creators do not own. If a court were to say that using this easily accessible data isn’t legal, it could make training AI systems vastly more expensive and less transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fJLBv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The details change when an algorithm generates media of its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sidyMb"&gt;Despite GitHub’s assertion, there is no direct legal precedent in the US that upholds publicly available training data as fair use, according to Mark Lemley and Bryan Casey of Stanford Law School, who &lt;a href="https://texaslawreview.org/fair-learning/"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; last year about AI datasets and fair use in the &lt;em&gt;Texas Law Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdB7mk"&gt;That doesn’t mean they are against it: Lemley and Casey write that publicly available data should be considered fair use, for the betterment of algorithms and to conform to the norms of the machine learning community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cg2jW"&gt;And there are past cases to support that opinion, they say. They consider the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/technology/google-books-case.html"&gt;Google Books case&lt;/a&gt;, in which Google downloaded and indexed more than 20 million books to create a literary search database, to be similar to training an algorithm. The Supreme Court upheld Google’s fair use claim, on the grounds that the new tool was transformative of the original work and broadly beneficial to readers and authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njyVJS"&gt;“There is not controversy around the ability to put all that copyrighted material into a database for a machine to read it,” Casey says about the Google Books case. “What a machine then outputs is still blurry and going to be figured out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAARqQ"&gt;This means the details change when the algorithm then generates media of its own. Lemley and Casey argue in their paper that if an algorithm begins to generate songs in the style of Ariana Grande, or directly rip off a coder’s novel solution to a problem, the fair use designation gets much murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRPmwe"&gt;Since this hasn’t been directly tested in a court, a judge hasn’t been forced to decide how extractive the technology really is: If an AI algorithm turns the copyrighted work into a profitable technology, then it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility for a judge to decide that its creator should pay or otherwise credit for what they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdNq2u"&gt;But on the other hand, if a judge were to decide that GitHub’s style of training on publicly available code was fair use, it would squash the need for GitHub and OpenAI to cite the licenses of the coders that wrote its training data. For instance, Celis, whose GitHub profile was generated by Copilot, says he uses the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, which requires attribution for derivative works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsKpEg"&gt;“And I fall in the camp that believes Copilot’s generated code is absolutely derivative work,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNAMcb"&gt;Until this is decided in a court, however, there’s no clear ruling on whether this practice is legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWipmf"&gt;“My hope is that people would be happy to have their code used for training,” Lemley says. “Not for it to show up verbatim in someone else’s work necessarily, but we’re all better off if we have better-trained AIs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to fast forward through a TikTok video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ga0Y7iUpJ7UBfJb7SCL_sgEQwYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550013/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ibhOk"&gt;TikTok videos aren’t what you would call long, but sometimes you might want to skip a few seconds ahead — especially now that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;videos can be up to three minutes long&lt;/a&gt;. Or you may have a favorite moment that you want to replay, over and over and over... Either way, TikTok has recently added a way to go forward and back on its videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydh7Et"&gt;When you’re playing a TikTok video, look at the bottom of the video for a faint white line. You will probably not see it in all videos; after some experimenting, I found that I was mainly finding it in the longer videos. If you do see it, then you can use it to go forward and back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Q99wyA"&gt;You should also see a slightly thicker white line progress as the video progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0LUOns"&gt;Touch the thicker white line and it will highlight, with a dot at the end indicating how far you are in the video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ehjpzS"&gt;Press the dot and use it to move the video ahead or back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shorter TikTok videos may not have the white line." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hMDi_ra1DjSeN0ANXaIb9D-4po=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702174/Screenshot_20210706_154801.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorter TikTok videos may not have the white line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Longer videos will have a line you can use to move forward or back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGJjxdC-1XZzCnOIjNO475LHFyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702176/Screenshot_20210706_150200.png"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A bigger, better Switch screen is exactly what I wanted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8E7Bw9rRHzDVohygVGo5XCcokg=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69549747/Untitled_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Switch will be released this October.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SttNm7"&gt;At least in many of the corners of the internet I’ve been reading all day, the response to the OLED Nintendo Switch has not been all that positive. It’s no surprise, really — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;credible reporting&lt;/a&gt; had suggested a more powerful model with 4K output, but the final product features the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;same internals&lt;/a&gt; as the current Switch. If you prefer to play Nintendo games on your TV, the new version’s bigger OLED screen isn’t going to do anything for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pzizem"&gt;I’m still buying one, though. A proper screen upgrade has been my most-wanted Switch feature ever since the console came out, and now more so than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy2SDF"&gt;I swapped my launch-model Switch for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; when it came out in 2019. Most of the Switch’s appeal is in its portable nature, I figured, so why not go all-in on a sleeker, more compact version with an actual D-pad? Well, turns out there are lots of reasons not to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q9uiyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Don’t count out the Nintendo Switch Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"},{"title":"Nintendo never needed to fix the Switch; it’s not broken","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="at7H2s"&gt;The Switch Lite is perfect for a lot of games, but damn near unusable for a bunch of others. The screen is just too dang small to read all the text in &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;, or to make any sense of the action in &lt;em&gt;Astral Chain&lt;/em&gt;. Cross-save functionality would make it a great portable &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; machine for when I’m away from my PC, except that I can barely see what’s happening on-screen. And for obvious reasons, you can forget about &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juIp1j"&gt;It’s not like the regular Switch’s 6.2-inch display is vastly bigger, but it does make a difference, and at least there you have the recourse of playing the worst offenders on your TV if need be. The Switch’s biggest strength is the way it runs the same games in TV and handheld modes, but inevitably some titles are going to be better suited to one than the other, and the Switch Lite only gives you one option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEAEX6"&gt;The new OLED Switch should solve the issue altogether. It has a TV dock, of course, but even in handheld mode I’d expect the bigger screen to make the aforementioned games a lot more playable, without causing a noticeable increase in the size of the console itself thanks to slimmed-down bezels. And the OLED panel technology should, in theory, also make them look much better, with deeper blacks and more vibrant colors. The LCD panels in the current Switch models are adequate at best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVTLyKi0ljOaK1hcvE-m98nG3i0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703114/E5nez6yXMBcUNZ3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Switch’s kickstand looks to be much-improved.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgy1vp"&gt;This is mostly just about me regretting the move to the Switch Lite, but I think the OLED Switch could be a solid upgrade from the launch model too. The kickstand looks much improved, and the bigger screen should make it more practical to play local multiplayer games in tabletop mode. And according to Nintendo, you’ll get the same boost to battery life that was introduced with 2019’s refresh to the original Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dep8N5"&gt;I do have some reservations about the OLED Switch. At $350, it feels like a price hike considering the regular Switch has sat at $299 since its 2017 launch. I really hope the screen doesn’t use a PenTile-style sub-pixel matrix commonly found in OLED panels, for example, because that would probably look pretty rough at 720p and 7 inches. (My guess/hope is that it will use a full RGB layout, like the PS Vita did almost ten years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEyaFJ"&gt;Mostly, though, I’m just glad I’ll be able to play more Switch games again. The Lite caused my Switch playtime to fall off a cliff over the last couple of years, and although it is very cute, I’ll be happy to see the back of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is returning to normal after experiencing issues on Tuesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Vm9DtfraPKvdj4wCShP5xIBDEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547917/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Id3eZN"&gt;The TikTok app “should be returning to normal” after it experienced issues on Tuesday, according to the app’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokSupport/status/1412579355973373953"&gt;support account on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iImJ0g"&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, I wasn’t able to log in to the app on either the web or my phone. When I tried, I got the following message, which felt like it was downplaying what was going on: “There is a small problem with the server, fixing it now.” Now, though, I am able to log in and use TikTok on iOS and the web as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vDyz4T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;...Annnnnd we're back! Your app experience should be returning to normal. Thanks for bearing with us, everyone ✨&lt;/p&gt;— TikTokSupport (@TikTokSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokSupport/status/1412579355973373953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cHgXoK"&gt;During the worst of the issues, they appeared to be fairly widespread, with more than 40,000 user reports of problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/tiktok/"&gt;on DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOFhZw"&gt;There were also many people on Twitter posting during the downtime using the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tiktokdown?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#tiktokdown hashtag&lt;/a&gt;. I gotta say, the memes on this hashtag were pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSLpCl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 6th, 9:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: TikTok says the service is returning to normal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conservative social networks keep making the same mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US capitol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hX8I-wtDg9JIz1B9Eu5fxZZnUIw=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548863/us_capitol_5.1419979475.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;On the rise and fall of Gettr&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QSEfG0"&gt;One question I have wondered a lot over the past few years is &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/was-parler-inevitable"&gt;whether the rise of a large-scale conservative social network — a Fox News of Facebook — is inevitable&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;the rise of Parler&lt;/a&gt;, we finally got a good test case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ts4Yag"&gt;Here was an app backed by the Mercer family, who previously championed Breitbart News, Donald Trump, and Cambridge Analytica, among other conservative causes. It was promoted relentlessly by top conservative media personalities, including Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and Dan Bongino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGSF4j"&gt;And it arrived amid a contentious election in which mainstream platforms’ responsible content moderation — labeling and removing misinformation; promoting reliable information about how to vote — was castigated by many conservatives as outrageous censorship and/or interference with the democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DEN8j"&gt;Then came the January 6th Capitol attack. Parler had been rife with calls for violence leading up to and during the insurrection, and in keeping with the platform’s “free speech” ethos, most had been allowed to stand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple responded by removing it from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;; Google later followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LuvTgq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The moment now seems to have passed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bmWg1X"&gt;By May, Parler had fired its CEO, shored up its content moderation practices, and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440005/parler-apple-app-store-return-amazon-google-capitol"&gt; returned to app stores&lt;/a&gt;. But, as &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/conservative-social-media-apps-decline-parler-d73956ff-ad6c-4657-a0bf-8e8122fa7948.html"&gt;Sara Fischer reported in &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;, the thrill appears to be gone. According to data from Sensor Tower, Parler downloads went from 517,000 in December to 11,000 in June. It’s part of an overall decline in the popularity of alt-platforms — and in conservative media generally — since former President Trump left office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OQxlL"&gt;At the height of election fever, Parler indeed had a moment. But the moment seems to have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="P9AkqV"&gt;
&lt;p id="swzwUq"&gt;The withering of Parler has not dissuaded other conservatives from attempting to build something similar. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reported that former members of Trump’s team were behind Gettr&lt;/a&gt;, an app whose stated mission is “fighting cancel culture, promoting common sense, defending free speech, challenging social media monopolies, and creating a true marketplace of ideas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqPNAg"&gt;This is more or less what Parler set out to do. (Like Parler, Gettr is also essentially a Twitter clone.) But Gettr, by virtue of not having been used to help coordinate a violent insurrection against the government, started with a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P87oG6"&gt;The slate remained clean for… a few minutes. It quickly became apparent that despite the involvement of former Trump spokesman Jason Miller, Trump himself had &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22559493/gettr-jason-miller-trump-app-social-media-facebook-twitter-free-speech-cancel-culture"&gt;no intentions of actually joining Gettr&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, multiple hashtags with racist and anti-Semitic slurs hit the app’s trending section, according to &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;, and multiple reports found a torrent of porn. (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-smut-is-flooding-trump-s-new-social-network-1847226591"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; porn&lt;/a&gt;, in particular.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IukZMR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A growing number of accounts on Jason Miller's new right-wing "Gettr" site posting "Sonic the Hedgehog furry porn" are being banned from the platform -- and now there is a push among leftist users to argue that "furry porn is protected under the first amendment."&lt;/p&gt;— Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1412423956993351694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBPbJ"&gt;Then the &lt;em&gt;Daily Beast &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpworld-app-is-bankrolled-by-fugitive-chinese-billionaire"&gt;reported that the whole thing had been funded by a fugitive Chinese billionaire&lt;/a&gt;. Then &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adgodev/status/1410667547335217169"&gt;Gettr’s source code was found out in the open&lt;/a&gt;. Then &lt;em&gt;Salon&lt;/em&gt; reported that a bug allowed hackers to easily download the personal information of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1412047951636140032"&gt;anyone who had created an account on the site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi8BHH"&gt;It’s all going so badly that you almost wonder if the app’s founders intended it this way, my &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/announcing-sidechannel-a-new-community"&gt;Sidechannel&lt;/a&gt; co-host Ryan Broderick &lt;a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-republican-social-network-filled?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNDEyNjIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM4MzA0NDM0LCJfIjoiZHhYckEiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjUyNTYzNjMsImV4cCI6MTYyNTI1OTk2MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTkzMTciLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.9ZXLxc9FMYPYNz7G2nStddoymPBPfgn8azGLCeh-NnE"&gt;writes at &lt;em&gt;Garbage Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BkqAcc"&gt;I’m also beginning to wonder if all these apps are their own grift in a way. Loudly launch a site no one will ever use, claim it’s a free speech sanctuary for Republicans, do the rounds on all the right-wing news outlets, and wait for it to fill up with the worst people on Earth, refuse to moderate it, wait for Apple to ban it from the App Store, and then go back to the right-wing news outlets and screech about liberal cancel culture impacting your ability to share hentai with white nationalist flat earthers or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HocnLR"&gt;When I first read this paragraph I assumed Ryan was exaggerating to make a point. Given the extremely predictable turmoil that emerged from Gettr’s content policies, though, I wonder if there isn’t something to this: a false-flag social network, set up only to watch it burn to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="A51Eps"&gt;
&lt;p id="j28MwW"&gt;But let’s say the whole thing isn’t a put-on. What should we take away from the Gettr debacle, and the Parler debacle before that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JezqiM"&gt;Lots of questions about social networks are hard. This one isn’t. If you create a place for people to upload text and images, you have to moderate it — and moderate it aggressively. You have to draw hard lines; you have to move those lines as society evolves and your adversaries adjust; you have to accept difficult trade-offs between users’ well being and their right to express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L85FmD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apps like Parler and Gettr offered their conservative users an attractive mirage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="weZW6X"&gt;Apps like Parler and Gettr offered their conservative users an attractive mirage: a free-speech paradise where they could say the things they couldn’t say elsewhere. It never seemed to occur to anyone that such a move would only select for the worst social media customers on earth, quickly turning the founders’ dreams to ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoSwXA"&gt;In a sane world, next-generation conservative founders would accept as a given that they would have to police their apps for racism, dangerous misinformation, and other harms. In return, they could use their editorial discretion to promote their favorite culture warriors, rig the trending topics as they wished, and possibly even attract enough advertisers to make the whole thing financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3P7YMW"&gt;To be sure, active content moderation is a necessary but not sufficient, condition for running a viable platform. Even if Parler and Gettr had scrubbed themselves entirely of coup talk and Sonic porn, enthusiasm for them may have waned for any number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzKe4N"&gt;But when you consider why these apps failed as quickly as they did, lax content moderation is surely among the biggest reasons. Most people will only spend so long in a virtual space in which they are surrounded by the worst of humanity. If Parler or Gettr will be remembered at all, it will be because they created networks for conservatives that not even conservatives could stand to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian hackers reportedly attacked GOP computer systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2H7Dgvsu5v_4Wooon6qitDNmeEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548680/acastro_170621_1777_0007_v2_0001_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvWhrV"&gt;Russian state hackers affiliated with the group Cozy Bear were reportedly behind an attack last week on Synnex, a contractor that provides IT services for the Republican National Committee (RNC), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. The attack may have exposed the organization’s information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLvpgG"&gt;When asked by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;a spokesperson for the RNC denied the organization’s systems had been hacked, but confirmed that one of its IT providers Synnex, had been exposed. The RNC provided the following statement in reference to the attack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hLZvbb"&gt;Over the weekend, we were informed that Synnex, a third party provider, had been breached. We immediately blocked all access from Synnex accounts to our cloud environment. Our team worked with Microsoft to conduct a review of our systems and after a thorough investigation, no RNC data was accessed. We will continue to work with Microsoft, as well as federal law enforcement officials on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fQkwN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.synnex.com/news/press-release-details/2021/SYNNEX-Responds-to-Recent-Cybersecurity-Attacks-and-Media-Mentions/default.aspx"&gt;In a statement released on July 6th&lt;/a&gt;, Synnex further confirmed “it is aware of a few instances where outside actors have attempted to gain access, through Synnex, to customer applications within the Microsoft cloud environment.” The company claims it is reviewing the attack alongside Microsoft and a third-party security firm. Manipulating enterprise software that interacts with Microsoft’s cloud rather than going after Azure or Office products directly shares some similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;the SolarWinds hack in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXnVJ4"&gt;And that connection would make sense: members of Cozy Bear working with SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html"&gt;are largely suspected to be behind the manipulation of the SolarWinds software for illegal ends&lt;/a&gt;. The SolarWinds breach potentially exposed information &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;from over a hundred companies and government organizations&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;compromised the tools of cybersecurity companies&lt;/a&gt; designed to prevent these kinds of attacks, like FireEye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOXGHD"&gt;There’s also parallels to draw between a breach of the RNC and the hack of the Democratic National Committee and Hilary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016. That breach, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12259258/wikileaks-leaked-democratic-national-committee-emails-personal-information"&gt;the leak of thousands of emails on WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568660/russia-dnc-hack-indictments-gru-mueller-guccifer-dcleaks"&gt;the indictment of 12 members of GRU&lt;/a&gt;, a Russian military intelligence agency with connections to another group of ursine-inspired Russian hackers called Fancy Bear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CngieM"&gt;The RNC attack arrives among a flurry of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and companies in the US. The list is long, but in the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;insurance provider CNA&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;IT software provider Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, have all been the victims of ransomware attacks. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests Cozy Bear’s attack could have used these ransomware hacks as a kind of cover, and even if they didn’t, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763608/microsoft-russia-election-hack-gru-phishing"&gt;attacking political targets is an ongoing problem&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t always end in a dramatic leak.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft issues emergency Windows patch to fix critical ‘PrintNightmare’ vulnerability</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ztCMQtMSzjjbES4NsAzCbqtpmik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548401/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pSKaLh"&gt;Microsoft has started rolling out an emergency Windows patch to address a critical flaw in the Windows Print Spooler service. The vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560435/microsoft-printnightmare-windows-print-spooler-service-vulnerability-exploit-0-day"&gt;dubbed PrintNightmare&lt;/a&gt;, was revealed last week, after security researchers accidentally published proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code. Microsoft has issued &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527"&gt;out-of-band security updates&lt;/a&gt; to address the flaw, and has rated it as critical as attackers can remotely execute code with system-level privileges on affected machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYsi0z"&gt;As the Print Spooler service runs by default on Windows, Microsoft has had to issue patches for Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows 8.1, Windows RT 8.1, and a variety of supported versions of Windows 10. Microsoft has even taken the unusual step of issuing patches for Windows 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065122/microsoft-windows-7-end-of-support-lifecycle-millions-pcs"&gt;officially went out of support last year&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has not yet issued patches for Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, and Windows 10 Version 1607, though. Microsoft says “security updates for these versions of Windows will be released soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiHdo3"&gt;It took Microsoft a couple of days to issue an alert about a 0-day affecting all supported versions of Windows. The PrintNightmare vulnerability allows attackers to use remote code execution, so bad actors could potentially install programs, modify data, and create new accounts with full admin rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xy6i3F"&gt;“We recommend that you install these updates immediately,” says Microsoft. “The security updates released on and after July 6, 2021 contain protections for CVE-2021-1675 and the additional remote code execution exploit in the Windows Print Spooler service known as ‘PrintNightmare’, documented in CVE-2021-34527.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t count out the Nintendo Switch Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjYughWEFUARdUXTjCu3rO0RBrw=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548349/switch_oled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YD4F1B"&gt;The Nintendo Switch is&lt;em&gt; fine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;Like Alex says&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no pressing reason for Nintendo to replace it right now. But does that mean &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;today’s new OLED variant&lt;/a&gt; has utterly dashed our dreams of a more powerful Switch Pro, one that might play games like &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Hyrule Warriors, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers &lt;/em&gt;without chugging? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMkDED"&gt;I wouldn’t rule out a Switch Pro just yet, partly because I have a hard time believing Nintendo can resist pumping out as many models as the market will hold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbCrZH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m on vacation today but just gonna leave this here for no particular reason &lt;a href="https://t.co/qo5B3xFHRY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qo5B3xFHRY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cgartenberg/status/1412453918387417093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X2DKgt"&gt;And partly because, if I were Nintendo, I’d be saving a Switch Pro for a moment it’ll truly count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3ekGz"&gt;Today, Nintendo would have to battle chip shortages and the pandemic game development slowdown to replace a console that’s... already flying off the shelves? But fast forward to 2022, and the company might have a more pressing reason to make a Switch with more horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V2EyXi"&gt;An easy choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LdxRIR"&gt;If we assume the rumors are true, Nintendo has been toying with a more powerful Switch for several years now, but repeatedly decided to hold back. In March 2019, longtime game industry reporter Takashi Mochizuki wrote that a new Switch &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-to-launch-two-new-switch-models-11553494773"&gt;would have “enhanced features targeted at avid videogamers,”&lt;/a&gt; only for Nintendo to announce a model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;that simply added additional battery life&lt;/a&gt;. This March, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade"&gt;Mochizuki got far more specific&lt;/a&gt; about a new OLED Switch due this year. One with “an upgraded Nvidia Corp chip with better graphics and processing” and 4K graphics when streamed on the TV thanks to Nvidia DLSS. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;But as we now know&lt;/a&gt;, the OLED model doesn’t have a new CPU, period. It’s got the same guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34KQtb"&gt;You can argue that’s because the Switch doesn’t really need a new chip — and we do argue it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; — but Nintendo might have had an uphill battle to get new CPUs to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfRUyr"&gt;Remember, we’re in the middle of a historic chip shortage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;a shortage with seemingly no end in sight&lt;/a&gt;, where giant companies are buying up all the chip-building capacity they can from an incredibly small number of players that actually produce the silicon. TSMC, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;which reportedly produces&lt;/a&gt; 92 percent of the world’s cutting-edge chips (and as much as 60 percent of the rest) is &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/22/tsmc-to-prioritize-apple-and-automaker-silicon-orders-as-global-semiconductor-shortage-continues/"&gt;said to be prioritizing Apple and hard-hit automakers&lt;/a&gt; over other firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kGEIv4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KakcPi"&gt;Even if Nvidia designed a new Tegra processor, built some sample parts, and Nintendo designed a new Switch Pro around it, that doesn’t mean Nintendo’s suppliers could necessarily produce the chips — particularly not at the quantities you’d need to meet demand and fill store shelves. There could be dire Switch Pro shortages, not unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;the shortages we’ve been seeing&lt;/a&gt; for the PS5, Xbox Series X, and every single decent Nvidia and AMD graphics card now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnVNzq"&gt;But Nintendo doesn’t need to fight for additional capacity if it sticks with today’s Nvidia Tegra chips. It just needs TSMC to keep the existing chips coming, where it’s already got quite a bit of capacity: the production lines now provide enough chips for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;over 28 million consoles a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PRbVl"&gt;Besides, while Nintendo has successfully surfed shortage waves in the past to drum up tremendous sales (most famously with the Nintendo Wii but also the early Switch), a Switch Pro shortage might hurt more than it helps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzLMiK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Don’t rock the boat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pvnanp"&gt;The existing Nintendo Switch has been the best-selling console in the US &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/06/nintendo_switch_has_been_the_us_best-selling_console_for_30_months_in_a_row"&gt;for 30 months in a row&lt;/a&gt;, and global sales were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;up 44 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the first three months of the year. Nintendo probably doesn’t want to risk that momentum with a mixed message about how you can’t easily buy a Switch, or how the new more powerful Switch may or may not play the same games as the old one (a mistake it made with the Wii U, and arguably with the New Nintendo 3DS). It’s also not clear if Nintendo has any games ready to show off and justify the power of a Switch Pro anyhow — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; sequel&lt;/a&gt; is now due in 2022, we’ve heard little about &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;since Nintendo rebooted development&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019, and &lt;em&gt;Bayonetta 3&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t have a release date. While it’s possible Nintendo has surprises up its sleeves, the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;hasn’t made game development easier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoCyRH"&gt;When Nintendo introduced its first Switch revisions in 2019, and again today, experts explained that mid-cycle refreshes are designed primarily to keep the momentum going. Nintendo’s done this with portables for years, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1412409245585248261"&gt;NPD analyst Mat Piscatella explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UAJhaQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Back in the day, Nintendo portable revisions would stabilize the demand curve and firm up ASPs. They were about maintaining sales performance, and preventing the pull of price drops and stale inventory. The Switch OLED is right out of this successful playbook.&lt;/p&gt;— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1412409245585248261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Ip1L"&gt;And while the OLED Switch doesn’t need a new Nvidia chip to keep that momentum today, there’s nothing stopping Nintendo from dropping a new processor into that OLED Switch (perhaps even literally) in the future, if Nintendo feels the need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvDjrZ"&gt;One of the striking things about the full-size Nintendo Switch’s refresh in 2019 was just how little the internal design changed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/5/20755253/nintendo-switch-lite-smaller-battery-new-processor-fcc-filings"&gt;We dove through teardown photos back then,&lt;/a&gt; and the new motherboard and processor almost looked like a drop-in replacement: same size, same layout, same battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVedwv"&gt;Perhaps next year — when Nintendo’s once again feeling the pressure to keep Switch sales high, no longer needs to fight for chips, and has a system-selling video game like the &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; sequel primed and ready to go — it’ll try again. Nintendo can drop that new-and-improved Nvidia Tegra chip into this year’s OLED-equipped Switch, give it a snappy name like New Nintendo Switch i Max Plus Remake Intergrade, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;maybe add some Bluetooth headphone support&lt;/a&gt;, and call it a day. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go is still incredibly relevant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dL92dWUh-Vy_lkFbwuvcjvNaIIs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548297/jbareham_160711_1134_0036_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iids08"&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is turning five years old this week, it’s still going strong with upcoming events, some notable fans, and what appears to be a whole lot of profit. It looks like Niantic’s &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; brought in over $5 billion since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/5/12102432/pokemon-go-release-date-ios-android-app-available"&gt;its launch in July of 2016&lt;/a&gt;, averaging around a billion dollars per year, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-five-billion-revenue"&gt;according to Sensor Tower analytics&lt;/a&gt;. The game started out as a viral sensation but has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;obviously had staying power&lt;/a&gt; over the five years that it’s been around. Sensor Tower claims that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; players spent $1.3 billion in 2020, besting its record-setting 2019 revenue by around $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsKdsD"&gt;Sensor Tower’s data seems to indicate that the game not only survived the pandemic, but came out stronger. It’s a bit surprising, at least to me, given how few people I know who still play. Sensor Tower cites Niantic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178230/pokemon-go-coronavirus-niantic-updates-temporary-discounts-inside"&gt;updates to the game&lt;/a&gt; as one of the reasons for the game’s 2020 success, as the company made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;more suited to a world&lt;/a&gt; where people couldn’t necessarily go for walks or gather in large crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcUiXC"&gt;While Niantic hasn’t released its own numbers or reasons for the success, we do know it plans to keep adapting to our new reality.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As we move into the latter half of 2021, Niantic says it’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/22544263/pokemon-go-gameplay-changes-pandemic-covid-19-niantic"&gt;planning on reverting some of the changes&lt;/a&gt; it made in response to the pandemic, while also keeping some around and further tweaking the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VvmleD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game also recently got a shout-out from Miyamoto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hjWJZH"&gt;The game doesn’t seem to be losing steam in 2021 — on July 17th and 18th, Niantic will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454064/pokemon-go-fest-2021-music-festival-pikachu-rock-pop-star"&gt;holding its online Pokémon Go Fest&lt;/a&gt;, with some cities &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/pokemongofest2021-cityactivations"&gt;having in-person events&lt;/a&gt; on the 17th. The event will be music-themed, and admission will cost $5, down from $14.99 in previous years, in honor of the game’s five-year anniversary. The game also recently got a shout-out from Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/qa2106e.pdf"&gt;in an investor Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, with the Mario and Zelda creator saying that he was hooked on playing &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; with his family. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal and DreamWorks films to exclusively hit Peacock within four months of theatrical releases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cik6FElLntTxGPSb0PD2qynosmI=/49x0:951x601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547838/peacock.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XxzPQc"&gt;Beginning next year, Universal theatrical releases will head to Peacock as exclusives no later than four months after they premiere in cinemas — a clear bid to win over subscribers who may have missed the studio’s flicks on the silver screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZbDrT"&gt;The multi-year deal will see not only Universal titles but films from DreamWorks, Illumination, and Focus Films as well. As part of the agreement, titles will head to Peacock for the first four months as well as the last four months of the traditional 18-month pay-one window, the companies announced Tuesday. (Pay-one refers to the agreements between services and studios for first rights to stream films and content after their initial release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmnmOQ"&gt;Universal’s 2022 film roster includes some highly anticipated releases. A spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that all Universal Filmed Entertainment Group releases next year — including &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World: Dominion&lt;/em&gt;, an untitled Jordan Peele horror film, &lt;em&gt;Minions: The Rise of Gru&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish &lt;/em&gt;— will hit Peacock no later than four months after their cinema releases as part of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9g5fmS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DreamWorks, Illumination, and Focus Films productions will also be included as part of the agreement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc2FQe"&gt;During the 10-month period between those two windows, the titles will head to other streaming services. This release model will allow “multiple audiences across a variety of streaming services to experience Universal’s award-winning and critically acclaimed film slate,” the companies said. As part of the agreement, which will begin in 2022, Universal will also produce exclusive releases for Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBNMrB"&gt;From the sounds of it, Peacock is betting big on exclusive streaming rights to Universal’s anticipated 2022 roster of films to lure potential subscribers to its recently launched streaming service. Peter Levinsohn, vice chair and chief distribution officer of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, said in a statement that the company was “excited to become Peacock’s first Pay-One partner while the platform continues to curate and build a vast film library that will delight its rapidly growing subscriber base.” &lt;/p&gt;
