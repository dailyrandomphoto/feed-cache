    <title>‘Rife with sexism’: employees of Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin describe ‘toxic’ workplace culture </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M5cUa"&gt;Twenty-one current and former employees of Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin published &lt;a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past"&gt;a damning essay&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday saying the company “turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8xjI5"&gt;Co-authored by Blue Origin’s former head of employee communications Alexandra Abrams, the essay describes multiple accounts of sexist and dismissive behavior from some of the company’s “one-hundred percent” male senior technical and program leaders and says “professional dissent at Blue Origin is actively stifled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Y01m"&gt;The employees accuse the company’s CEO, Bob Smith, of brushing off dissent by discouraging staff from raising questions during internal town halls, asking a colleague to track “troublemakers or agitators,” and forcing out employees for speaking out about safety issues related to Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourism rocket. “Smith’s inner circle of loyalists makes unilateral decisions, often without the buy-in of engineers, other experts, or senior leaders across various departments,” the employees say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEZSqI"&gt;In an interview with CBS this morning, Abrams, speaking out for the first time, said she was fired by Blue Origin in 2019, quoting her manager as saying, “Bob and I can’t trust you anymore,” referring to the CEO. “You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time,” Abrams said in the interview. “I’ve gotten far enough away from it that I’m not afraid enough to let them silence me anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BX5hY7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alexandra Abrams, a former head of employee communications for Blue Origin, is speaking out against the company to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LaurieSegall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LaurieSegall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time. They are incompatible.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/JHuFY3cjcs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JHuFY3cjcs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1443553601851322372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIuM1Y"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Blue Origin spokesperson said, “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps3fKG"&gt;The spokesperson also said Abrams was fired “after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations,” a claim Abrams denied to CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuERH4"&gt;The essay, published on Lioness, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537102/tech-workers-harassment-hotline-vault-lioness-strategies"&gt;platform for whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt;, indicated Blue Origin sometimes overlooked safety issues to favor speed amid heated competition with other billionaire-backed companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX or Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. “Competing with other billionaires — and ‘making progress for Jeff’ — seemed to take precedence over safety concerns that would have slowed down the schedule,” the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzY7wJ"&gt;A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, which manages launch safety and oversees flights of Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, said, “the FAA takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6w0H0"&gt;In the essay, the employees also recounted sexism from colleagues, including a former, unnamed executive who would call female employees “baby girl,” “baby doll,” or “sweetheart” and ask about their dating lives. “It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos — it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,” they said. Another passage included: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Xu4gi5"&gt;Additionally, a former NASA astronaut and Blue Origin senior leader once instructed a group of women with whom he was collaborating: “You should ask my opinion because I am a man.” We found many company leaders to be unapproachable and showing clear bias against women. Concerns related to flying New Shepard were consistently shut down, and women were demeaned for raising them. When one man was let go for poor performance, he was allowed to leave with dignity, even a going-away party. Yet when a woman leader who had significantly improved her department’s performance was let go, she was ordered to leave immediately, with security hovering until she exited the building five minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="92maFt"&gt;On top of the safety and sexism claims, the letter attacks Bezos and Blue Origin’s record on environmental issues. The employees say while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;Bezos touts his climate initiatives&lt;/a&gt;, Blue Origin has no plans to be carbon neutral or reduce its environmental footprint and that some machinery ordered by the company was done so without considering its waste levels or whether it’d need permits to manage the waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTm5R0"&gt;The employees also described harsh and demanding conditions that have “taken a toll on the mental health of many of the people who make Blue Origin’s operations possible.” The essay cites internal memos, including one that cast SpaceX as a model, “in that ‘burnout was part of their labor strategy.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOIYGB"&gt;On Friday, CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;obtained &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/blue-origin-ceo-bob-smith-email-response-to-toxic-workplace-essay.html"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; from Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith to his employees addressing the allegations. Smith said in the letter that the company would “reflect on what we can learn and improve” and that it has “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yjtznr"&gt;He also said, “the New Shepard team went through a methodical and pain-staking process to certify our vehicle for First Human Flight. Anyone that claims otherwise is uninformed and simply incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTP72u"&gt;Blue Origin has struggled with internal strife in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZeZf7"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21198272/blue-origin-coronavirus-leaked-audio-test-launch-workers-jeff-bezos"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported that Blue Origin employees were outraged by the pressure they faced from senior leadership&lt;/a&gt; to continue in-person work and travel for a New Shepard test launch during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when much of the country was locking down to curb the virus’s spread. Responding to employee concerns in one meeting, Jeff Ashby, the company’s senior mission assurance director and a former NASA astronaut, said: “I would say that you should ask yourself, as an individual, are you acting as a toxin in the organization, fanning discontent, or are you really trying to help our senior leaders make better decisions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqzov7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 2:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional information from the essay and a statement from the FAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPK2Gz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 1st, 11:27AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated with information from Smith’s letter to Blue Origin employees. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New accessibility features are coming to Halo Infinite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRRczOR251scrEx6bQ1iK7X88OY=/145x0:1941x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937171/halo_infinite_keyart_primary_horiz_9e788e276ba740e3af6451ef073fd3de.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAEPf6"&gt;343 Industries has added improved accessibility features to&lt;em&gt; Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KczSxV"&gt;“343 Industries’ goal is to make the newest journey into the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe more accessible to as many gamers as possible,” Xbox shared &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/01/xbox-celebrates-disability-community/"&gt;on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. “That includes those who are brand-new to the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; franchise, as well as those who struggled to play due to barriers that hadn’t previously been accounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7ZBAs"&gt;The features include accessibility standards like enhanced colorblind settings and the ability to rebind mouse, keyboard, and gamepad controls. 343 is also adding new innovations like the movement-assisted steering feature, which allows users to add more controls to help steer vehicles like the Warthog and Mongoose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrvg5Y"&gt;Here’s a list of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s accessibility features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bPGDJa"&gt;For subtitles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g02yhh"&gt;Adjust the font size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KHHwLV"&gt;Adjust the background opacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FIAh2H"&gt;Enable color coding of dialogue per speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ruHAmT"&gt;Choose whether you’d like subtitles for all dialogue or just dialogue related to the narrative in campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PGVOkN"&gt;General gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wxm8ie"&gt;Customize menu and gameplay font size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3NlqfW"&gt;Menu narration with adjustable narration speed for those who commonly utilize screen readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egBS74"&gt;A new mode called “Linear Navigation” that lets users navigate through the UI without the need to visually see how controls are positioned on-screen to access them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CdijQ"&gt;Option of changing the friendly and enemy colors to include more options than just red versus blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdirg4"&gt;More UI settings, such as HUD (Heads-up Display) and reticle opacity to make it easier to identify information in the HUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U4xyal"&gt;Text-to-speech and speech-to-text options for players that want to participate in voice chat and either need to send synthesized voice or receive voice chat as synthesized text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jnj53a"&gt;New customizations for players to control their sound experience with different volume sliders for a variety of sounds in the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BQE6Co"&gt;Customizability for both controller and keyboard and mouse to rebind keys, adjust sensitivity, and change to taps and toggles versus holds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5dSArL"&gt;A new Movement Assisted Steering feature, which lets you use additional controls to help steer wheeled vehicles rather than just the classic “look-to-steer” mechanic 						&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL6ZKm"&gt;Accessibility and inclusion in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; aren’t limited to the game’s settings. 343 Industries partnered with disabled service member group Warfighter Engaged to design prosthetic customization options for players creating their own Spartans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jT1JIQ"&gt;These new &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; features are a part of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVItZfE0FFY"&gt;a greater push at Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;across the gaming industry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system"&gt;to be more accessible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445828/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-ps5-accessibility-toggles"&gt;to players of all abilities&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286216/microsoft-xbox-games-tested-accessibility-guidelines"&gt;Microsoft launched a program&lt;/a&gt; in which developers can have their games tested and evaluated for their accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7VwAZ"&gt;“Accessibility is a journey,” Xbox says. “And 343 Industries will continue to update &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in ways that empower as many people as possible to battle alongside the Master Chief.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nScNMD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launches December 8th. 						&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox is making it easier to find accessible games in its stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox X in a circle logo against a dark background with green lines. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fal-LSEQOdyuUEyYmSuDS7yTH0k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937114/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IhhMIN"&gt;Xbox is making it easier to find accessibility information for games, according to an announcement from the company at its &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gVItZfE0FFY"&gt;Accessibility Showcase&lt;/a&gt;. Games in the Microsoft store will have accessibility feature tags, so players with disabilities can make sure games have the features they need before buying or downloading them. The tags are appearing in the store for members of the &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-accessibility-insider-league"&gt;Xbox Accessibility Insiders League&lt;/a&gt; (XAIL) starting today and will eventually roll out to all Xbox users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XakC5T"&gt;The tags address an issue commonly expressed by players with disabilities: they often have to do their own research to figure out which games they can play. Listing certain features in the store consolidates information that can be frustrating to track down, especially if it’s not available on developer websites or in reviews. Publishers will also be able to link to additional information from the store. While the tag system is starting in the Microsoft Store, Xbox says they’ll also start showing up on Xbox.com, the Xbox app on PC, and Xbox Game Pass apps in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Microsoft store titled “Accessibility spotlight” showing categories for featured games, gameplay, audio, and visual features. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKE_KvgREAIk9ozCwSLZllNQ9pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891763/accesibility_spotlight.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xbox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new spotlight in the store for accessible games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P81sKZ"&gt;Xbox says it plans to gather feedback from XAIL members over the next month before expanding the availability of the tags. Part of the fine-tuning for the tags involves determining specific sets of criteria that games need to meet in order to be labeled with each feature — a game with subtitles that can’t be resized, for instance, wouldn’t meet the bar for the subtitle options tag. The list of tags includes 20 features, like narrated game menus, input remapping, and single stick gameplay, and more could be added in the future based on feedback from players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PhXlEJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New accessibility features are coming to Halo Infinite ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704024/halo-infinite-accessibility-features-colorblind-steering-controls"},{"title":"Microsoft starts new program to help make more accessible games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286216/microsoft-xbox-games-tested-accessibility-guidelines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b4klEh"&gt;There’s also a new “Accessibility Spotlight” section in the store, with games in different categories based on the accessibility features they have, like audio or visual. Search results will be filterable by feature in coming months, according to Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho4QIY"&gt;Xbox also announced several other features that it says will launch soon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EZGX9K"&gt;Quick settings, which allow people to toggle accessibility features on or off without leaving a game or app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8o0XbG"&gt;Global color filters on Xbox Series X|S, for people with colorblindness to customize how colors are displayed across games, apps, and menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="or0pUC"&gt;Night mode with adjustable filters and brightness, controller and power button light dimming, and scheduling options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uWfjy9"&gt;A free gaming accessibility fundamentals course for developers launching in Microsoft Learn in late October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Nigeria says it will lift Twitter ban if the company meets certain conditions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BB9PaD4Qs_ScobE8y_3f2akM7OQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936901/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is currently banned in Nigeria | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAsmbO"&gt;Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said Friday that he would lift the country’s ban on Twitter if the company met certain conditions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520166/twitter-suspended-nigeria-delete-tweet-president-violate-rules"&gt;Nigeria’s government suspended Twitter &lt;/a&gt;“indefinitely” in June, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249?s=20"&gt;accusing the social media platform&lt;/a&gt; of “activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence.” The ban followed a few days after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/04/1003506918/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-it-deleted-a-tweet-by-the-president"&gt;Twitter removed&lt;/a&gt; a threatening tweet by Buhari that it said violated its policy against abusive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImXfnc"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://guardian.ng/features/nigeria-at-61-full-text-of-president-muhammadu-buharis-independence-day-speech/"&gt;transcript of Buhari’s Friday remarks&lt;/a&gt;, which he made during a televised speech commemorating Nigeria’s Independence Day, Twitter had reached out to the Nigerian government to try to resolve the ban. He said a presidential committee had “engaged” with Twitter to address key issues, including “national security and cohesion; registration, physical presence and representation; fair taxation; dispute resolution; and local content.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5E30AR"&gt;“Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed, and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements,” Buhari said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWjNXs"&gt;Buhari said in his address that social media was “a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialize, and access news and other information,” without specifying which platform he was referring to. He added that some users had “misused the platform” — again, without singling out one platform by name — “to organize, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syaQps"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that discussions with the Nigerian government had been “respectful and productive,” and that the company continues “to engage with the Nigerian government and we are committed to charting a path forward to the restoration of Twitter for everyone in Nigeria.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJD9C3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 1st 10:52AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Twitter spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hisense’s 55-inch 4K QLED TV is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uk-rhHqpNHmcxZk1MOqFmCVhlcQ=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936666/hisenseu6g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hisense&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PrxWBY"&gt;Hisense’s U6G QLED TV in the 55-inch size is discounted at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091Y2KLZZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfHiMbtsRwa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; today. Normally $649.99, you can pick it up from either Best Buy or Amazon for just $520. Its quantum dot LED-backlit display should offer better contrast and color accuracy than the many low-end models available around the $400-$500 price range. It has Google Assistant built in, too, along with support for a bevy of streaming apps, including YouTube, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and more. It has four HDMI ports and a native refresh rate of 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qJyVs"&gt;It might be of importance to you that Hisense includes this model in its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22675894/hisense-100-day-no-regrets-guarantee-promotion-tv-8k-laser" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 Day No Regrets Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;.” You can try out the TV for 100 days, and if you don’t like it, Hisense will refund you after you send it back. Both Best Buy and Amazon are among the company’s approved retailers for the promotion. You just have to make sure to &lt;a href="https://hisense-promos.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;register your purchase with Hisense&lt;/a&gt; within 14 days of the purchase date, or else you won’t be able to get the refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MfzOAj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10739604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/io2DZsiz6qMn9IJhwuTkCy6C7AQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311008/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_5.45.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dshGvK"&gt;Once a collector’s item due to their scarcity, this set of Joy-Con styled after &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt; are both readily available &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;discounted at Walmart. Normally $80 for the two, they’re $10 off, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJoy-Con-L-R-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Skyward-Sword-HD-Edition%2F761765925&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $70 when you buy online through Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This set will work with the standard Switch, as well as the new Switch that has an OLED screen releasing later next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FvUemf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10784120"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Cnx5xa"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack doesn’t provide a lot of juice, but it sure is nice to use #shorts|103140" data-volume-uuid="06b797d44" data-volume-id="103140" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-579" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MfScOC"&gt;If you recently purchase an iPhone 13, or are more about the iPhone 12, you might want to check out AT&amp;amp;T’s deal on the MagSafe Battery Pack that can magnetically attach to either of these phones for a recharge. Normally $99, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/batteries/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it costs $84 now&lt;/a&gt;. We covered this deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/9/30/22701993/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, and admittedly I’m surprised that it hasn’t sold out, given it’s the first major price cut on this product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8KGyr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;As my colleague Dieter Bohn says in his review&lt;/a&gt;, this product is more about convenience than providing a massive amount of battery capacity. So, while it probably won’t totally refill your phone, it’s a solid investment for easy top-ups throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XGQoAv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W92znm"&gt;It’s our tenth birthday this year, and we’re hosting &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergesecondary" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our very own party&lt;/a&gt; later this month in New York City. Good news: you’re invited! It’s a two-day party filled with special guests, live performances, food, drinks, and more.

For those who are new to join us there, my colleagues and I aim to send out two newsletters a week, packed full of the best deals.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We bought gadgets from Amazon’s banned brands and it was a piece of cake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eAQ1wRHVsCK08BtFS2znoTVbRfQ=/0x126:3024x2142/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936294/verge_sean_hollister_20210930_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QjwQ5K"&gt;If you’re a reputable Chinese gadget manufacturer with millions of dollars at stake &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy"&gt;because Amazon banned your ass&lt;/a&gt; for inflating user reviews... do you roll over? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701144/amazon-chinese-companies-lawsuit-paid-reviews"&gt;File a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;? Or change a single letter in your name and try to sneak back onto Amazon anyhow? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k73nLj"&gt;It sure seems like Sunvalley, parent company of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;RavPower, Vava and TaoTronics brands&lt;/a&gt;, chose door number three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fndfdK"&gt;We recently spotted all three banned brands back on the Amazon storefront under the flimsiest of disguises: Vava had changed its name to “Vav,” TaoTronics became “Taotronic,” and RavPower was simply “Rav.” We took screenshots for posterity: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAgy9hRGjB9FnBxIjV5JifIzhaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892147/vav_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhB5uFz0G-2wP8p1wFCGGBgxCso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892148/taotronic_dear_dreams_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOCkqca4j8sSvp8LHOojHeIz1lc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892151/rav_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ouWZhn"&gt;They’re not the only ones, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;Banned brand Choetech&lt;/a&gt; didn’t even need to change a letter at first. It just hid in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8E2Ns9K5-jORzlaE2lUVCvTb9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892156/choetech_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aoS1S7"&gt;Amazon didn’t catch any of these listings until we brought them to the company’s attention nearly two weeks ago, on September 17th. It was only yesterday that the company finished removing them — because yes, Amazon determined that these were indeed bad actors trying to dodge their bans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kMgFl"&gt;Here’s the company’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="up8Hv9"&gt;We blocked these brands, their product detail pages, and the selling accounts used to perpetrate their policy violations. Unfortunately, these bad actors are motivated and use various tactics to evade detection in their attempts to harm honest customers, selling partners, and Amazon. We have a number of proactive controls in place that are preventing the vast majority of their attempts. If you discover a bad actor attempting to reenter our store that we have missed, we will investigate quickly and take the appropriate actions, including using this to continue to improve our proactive controls. Customers can contact Customer Service 24/7 via phone, email, and chat with any concern they have about a product or their shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4csBPW"&gt;Amazon doesn’t formally have a ban-dodging policy like some other platforms. No, the company &lt;a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G1801?language=en_US"&gt;doesn’t let you have more than one seller account&lt;/a&gt; — but that doesn’t necessarily apply here because Amazon wiped these brands’ previous accounts off the map. The new statement makes it pretty clear that the deterrent doesn’t end when a company’s first seller account is kicked off Amazon; they’re supposed to be gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOfx1Y"&gt;But if that’s the intent, Amazon needs to step up its game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHX4R4"&gt;Between the time we reported these items to Amazon and the time they removed them, we bought every single one of the items pictured above, had them shipped to us, and confirmed they were legit. While we were waiting for them to ship, we found &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; sellers carrying these banned products, ones we didn’t report to Amazon, which are still operational today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="at7ODe"&gt;Here, let me show you how easy it is to find a brand dodging its ban. Here’s another picture of that Choetech wireless charger:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPfcMq5t69-MI_HBHlg5fR0DpSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892238/choetech_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVsh5D"&gt;Take a close look at the upper left. See how Amazon’s recommending I pick a very similar looking charger instead? &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charger-Certified-Charging-Compatible/dp/B098X8BVK3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Let’s click on it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JahSLCeQXG3HJLbDYwJ5QjVxWNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892240/choetech_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xezGSd"&gt;It’s similar because it’s the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; — it’s even sold by “Choe Technology.” Choe Tech. Choetech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc7vlN"&gt;Just to be absolutely sure, we bought that no-name charger from Amazon. Here it is, Choetech logo and all:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BleJxt2aa3kn8QndK5OT8ojWRjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892242/verge_sean_hollister_20210930_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zyKXdZ"&gt;In the upper-right corner of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; image, there’s a sticker that says “100% official product.” The back of the box has a QR code you can scan that takes you to &lt;a href="http://choetech.com/"&gt;choetech.com&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, there’s even a Choetech “Scratch and Check” label so you can be sure it’s authentic. I couldn’t stop smirking at just&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;how thoroughly official this product was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCX9qs"&gt;I should probably add that if you search Amazon for “Choetech,” the company’s products — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A31SFNOKIVH4CK&amp;amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER"&gt;12 of them and counting&lt;/a&gt; — are the first non-sponsored search results. I know Amazon’s employees can’t be everywhere whacking every mole, but if Amazon’s search engine knows exactly how to direct consumers to its banned brand, you’d think the company could direct its employees to them as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KehuVN"&gt;In case you’re wondering, no, none of these products came with a blatant “we’ll give you money for a review” insert card &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starfire2258/status/1407416198623494144"&gt;like the ones I’m soliciting&lt;/a&gt; for a future story. Three of them did come with a card suggesting I join their “VIP” program, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NiCsZ"&gt;P.S. Maybe Amazon should check out &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=KALOXI&amp;amp;ref=bl_dp_s_web_0"&gt;Kaloxi&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like a dead ringer for TaoTronics. And to the Amazon rep who did snuff out &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/1E2DACD8-335A-481E-B792-EB3F72170D40"&gt;iSmart&lt;/a&gt; before I could bring it to your attention: kudos!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYdckf"&gt;Sunvalley didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Our emails to Choetech bounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Le13uV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cWTsN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of The Verge’s 10-year party at Spring Studios in NYC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Join us in New York City for live performances, amazing artists and creators, and much more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Kg9Dbv"&gt;Hello, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;friends! It’s almost been 10 years since we launched (can you believe it?), and to celebrate we’re throwing a big party. It’s happening on October 22nd and 23rd in New York City — and &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;we hope you’ll join us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVpRtM"&gt;We’re throwing this party at Spring Studios, which has a rich tradition of bringing creative people together to show off the future of tech, art, and culture. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will completely transform the space for two days and fill it with special guests, live performances, interactive art and games, awesome food and drink, and an opening night party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s6d3e5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Join us at On The Verge!","description":"The Verge is turning 10, and you’re invited to help us celebrate in New York City on October 22nd and 23rd. (Hint: get $50 off the standard ticket prices with code &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;URGETOVERGE&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.)","label":"Buy tickets","url":"https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergesecondary"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="naCd5g"&gt;Here’s some of what we’re excited about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mZNe56"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;exclusive premiere screening&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFPdR85yOiM_jt1LXuZmNesYYt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892324/Springboard_Thumb.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1cOLZ"&gt;Everyone who attends On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will see the debut of our biggest documentary to date, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring split off from the mainstream tech world to try and invent the future before the present was ready for it. And though Handspring has been relegated to the margins of tech history, many of the predictions they chased in the late 90s would be correct. After the screening, we’ll hold a live Q&amp;amp;A with Dieter and Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZAiQs"&gt;Live performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="6JlhL4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbK_dQ5wXGk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4dwsn"&gt;Our opening night party will feature a live performance by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I73SGyUTsM"&gt;The Stickmen&lt;/a&gt;: an amazing DJ and drummer duo that will transform our expo space with light and sound. And we’ll have a great lineup of other talented DJs to bring the space to life throughout the entire event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8oDjmw"&gt;A one-of-a-kind indie arcade&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFrKpRby46MNr5VdJ339qsI949k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890465/ef97f32612f5c2179942fd123755ab13.WONDERVILLE.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95rs8S"&gt;We’ve assembled a wildly creative group of artists &amp;amp; creators to make On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fun and interactive. That includes the folks from &lt;a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/"&gt;Wonderville arcade in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, who will be putting together their unique lineup of games for guests to enjoy. (We’re particularly excited about The Giffinator, which will let you put yourself and your friends inside of a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;animated GIF.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k5WLcE"&gt;Experimental art&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39ulcNkSY3OtkZmgjHNc5C-7cC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890725/Studio_5.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fb72u9"&gt;We’re gathering creators working on the edge of the future, including the wildly talented &lt;a href="http://zach.li/"&gt;Zach Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;: an artist, researcher, and educator who creates performances and installations that take human gestures as input and amplify them in different ways. He’s bringing several works to On The Verge, including &lt;em&gt;Reflection Studies, &lt;/em&gt;which will transform one of the largest spaces at Spring Studios into an interactive art experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkKPLi"&gt;The Creators Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tcNId3"&gt;We’re turning the roof of Spring Studios into a space for interactive talks, demos, and performances — including science and tech demos, a creative illustration class, and a repair school hosted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22702324%2Fon-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our friends at iFixit&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to just hang out, you’ll be able to take in spectacular views of the city while enjoying some of the best food and drink it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dc3rTb"&gt;All-day programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2e8oqK"&gt;On top of all that, our main stage will be packed for both days of the event with live performances and talks with special guests. Head over to the event website &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;to learn more about who’s coming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDTzIs"&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;first big event, and it won’t be our last. We hope you’ll join us as we kick off the next 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which will be bigger, brighter, and more exciting: just like the future we imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj6nCR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: COVID-19 is still a reality, and the health and safety of everyone at the event is our first priority. So everyone who joins us will be required to follow masking protocols and provide confidential proof of vaccination. Stay tuned: we’ll keep everyone updated on the latest health and safety requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humble Bundle has raised $200 million for charity thanks to generous gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iayd-U955kGZSTgA4FnYdWaVxsU=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935830/humblebundle_200_million.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EP8ZUv"&gt;If you play video games on the PC then there’s a good chance at some point in your life you’ve purchased something from Humble Bundle: a digital storefront that regularly announces time-limited, pay-what-you-want game bundles, each of which sets aside a slice of the proceeds for charity. This week, the company announced that it’s now &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/09/30/200-million-raised-for-charity-thank-you-humble-community/"&gt;raised more than $200 million&lt;/a&gt; for good causes around the world — so: well done, gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2fz2D"&gt;The Humble Bundle concept first appeared in 2010, pioneered by indie game studio Wolfire Games, but was soon spun off into its own entity, with a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F1%2F22703917%2Fhumble-bundle-200-million-charity-milestone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated store&lt;/a&gt; and publishing subsidiary, Humble Games. Now the company offers bundles for books, comics, and software, as well as a monthly subscription service, Humble Choice. The firm recently raised more than $1.17 million for relief initiatives for COVID-19 through its Humble Heal bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lusbad"&gt;“Today, we’re excited to announce that since that very first bundle in 2010, tens of millions of you have now helped raise a total of $200 million through your Humble purchases, resulting in unparalleled support from the global gaming community for important social causes,” wrote the company in a &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/09/30/200-million-raised-for-charity-thank-you-humble-community/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neopets are being turned into NFTs because of course they are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FlSFEOzAUde6IbL7GKE0JLmye3Q=/1x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935788/neopets.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neopets was a hugely popular virtual pet adoption site launched in 1999. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sqw2oS"&gt;Virtual pet franchise Neopets is getting into NFTs — a seemingly inevitable move for a site with a long and varied history that has spawned a dizzying array of merchandise and offshoots, from magazines and cards to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18068518/neopets-legends-letters-new-mobile-game-puzzles-dragons"&gt;mobile games&lt;/a&gt; and a (promised) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21293330/neopets-animated-series-launch-fall-2021-merch-plush-mobile-site"&gt;animated series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxvtY9"&gt;You may not be familiar with Neopets, but it was a staple for many who grew up online in the early to mid-2000s. The basic concept is that users adopt virtual pets, and then spend hours farming games and events to attain items and customize their little darlings. It sounds simple, but the site was hugely popular in its day (thanks in no small part to a &lt;a href="https://www.themarysue.com/neopets-economy/"&gt;thriving and addictive&lt;/a&gt; internal economy), boasting more than 30 million active users around 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7JDANL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neopets had more than 30 million users in its heyday but has long been in decline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1A4fBJ"&gt;Neopets has been in decline for a long time now, and it’s hard to get a handle on how many active users remain. The site itself is a wreck, due to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@nicolecarpenter/neopets-as-we-know-it-is-about-to-be-obliterated-78db2076412c"&gt;Adobe ending support for Flash&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to code much of Neopets’ original functionality. But there remains a core of dedicated Neopians — active enough that the brand’s current owners, JumpStart Games, evidently thought it worth trying to wring a little crypto out of fond memories for the site. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKyBNjWXoxCfaz9eRGkWXgRnyio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892991/Neopets_Neopets_Launches_its_First_NFT_Collection___The_Neopets.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CNW Group/Neopets&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Neopets NFTs are supposed to be launching some time this month. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ru3l0t"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/neopets-launches-its-first-nft-collection-the-neopets-metaverse-collection-823127718.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, JumpStart says it’s partnering with blockchain firm Raydium to produce 20,500 “equally unique, algorithmically generated lovable Neopets NFTs with variable backgrounds, assets, clothing, and personality — 7 varying trait categories.” Samples of the NFTs in question show a handful of neopets in custom outfits on gradient backgrounds. It seems from JumpStart’s announcement that the NFTs will just be... regular NFTs — aka pictures that you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;can’t actually do anything with&lt;/a&gt;, apart from acquire for bragging rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZonBIJ"&gt;The reaction from the Neopets community to the news has been overwhelmingly negative. Fansites like &lt;a href="http://JellyNeo.net"&gt;Jellyneo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://impress-2020.openneo.net/"&gt;Dress To Impress&lt;/a&gt; have strongly criticized the move, deriding it as a cynical cash grab, an environmentally destructive decision, and a launch that adds nothing to the core functionality of the site. “You can’t feed your NFT, read to it, battle with it, or customise it. It’s the #AntiNeopet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jellyneo/status/1442224869215662080"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; the official Jellyneo account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ExElDs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Neopets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Neopets&lt;/a&gt; community overwhelmingly rejects the new NFT cashgrab project. We’re hard pressed finding someone outside of the NFT community that wants this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/IkyQsdkLBv"&gt;https://t.co/IkyQsdkLBv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jellyneo.net (@jellyneo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jellyneo/status/1441799882600173573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="g8YYHm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dress to Impress's official position is that NFTs are bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They're an inherently zero-value product that commoditizes art in all the wrong ways,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and they further legitimize an environmentally destructive cryptocoin movement that is currently mostly a pump-and-dump scam.&lt;/p&gt;— Dress to Impress (@NeopetsDTI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeopetsDTI/status/1441656600465264640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="55eHAP"&gt;The Neopets team has responded to some of this criticism, as per &lt;a href="https://www.jellyneo.net/?comments=13857"&gt;a Q&amp;amp;A shared on Jellyneo&lt;/a&gt;, but their answers are not particularly convincing. For example, on the charge that NFTs are harmful to the environment, the company says that its partners Raydium and Solana “[strive] to be a more environmentally friendly NFT solution than competitors” — a fairly meaningless statement. (Data on the environmental impact of NFTs is hazy at best, but, as with much crypto activity, we know that minting NFTs is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;an extremely energy intensive&lt;/a&gt; activity.) Similarly, in response to the question “Why make NFTs?” JumpStart says it’s “looking for new opportunities to drive our brands and product forward into the future.” It’s a depressingly honest answer, but not one that is likely to endear the project to Neopians who associate the franchise with beloved and nostalgic memories of their youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJMvdN"&gt;It’s worth noting also, that for a brand as long-lived as Neopets, this isn’t even their first time round the NFT blockchain. It previously launched a trading card game powered by NFTs called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neopetscrypto?lang=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neopets Cryptoquest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 which swiftly died out due to lack of interest. NFTs are, of course, a much bigger industry now than they were three years ago, but fans fear that whether or not this project lives has nothing to do with the long-term future of Neopets. As one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/pus6c1/tnt_isnt_going_to_fix_the_site_theyre_going_to/"&gt;representative post&lt;/a&gt; on the site’s subreddit notes: “TNT [The Neopets Team] isn’t going to fix the site. They’re going to milk it for what it has left and then close it for good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOpbF8"&gt;Perhaps this is simply the place of NFTs in a media landscape obsessed with the lingering value of “IP.” NFTs are a predator of last resort, sucking the remaining dregs of value from brands big and small in the name of financial efficiency. Will Neopets survive the embrace? The community’s certainly seen worse before, but the site is in decline in so many other ways (broken games and events; sporadic updates) that this might be the final straw. At any rate: this is a reminder to check on your neopets. They’re hungry and they miss you. &lt;/p&gt;
