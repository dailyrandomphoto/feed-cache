    <title>OnePlus Watch review: big, basic, and boring</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;OnePlus’ first smartwatch is missing a lot of what makes a smartwatch smart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ERVyka"&gt;What makes a smartwatch “smart”? Is it the ability to show you notifications from your phone? What about the ability to track your physical activity and wellness, such as step counts, workouts, and sleep? How about providing you information about your day, such as the weather and upcoming calendar events? Or perhaps it’s the inclusion of a voice assistant on your wrist that you can ask to do things without having to use your phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7h69Ye"&gt;Those are the questions I’ve been asking over the past week-plus as I’ve been testing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;new OnePlus Watch&lt;/a&gt;, a $159 smartwatch and the first wearable from the smartphone company. The OnePlus Watch has all the looks of a modern smartwatch, but as I’ve learned wearing it on my wrist day and night, it doesn’t have all the smarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s14NeP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10442559"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qrKylt"&gt;The OnePlus Watch is not like a Wear OS smartwatch, such as those made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Fossil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21162829/moto-360-review-smartwatch-third-gen-wearos-specs-features-price"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;Mobvoi&lt;/a&gt;. Nor is it like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Watch&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. All of those have software platforms that integrate with other apps and services, so you can download apps or watchfaces to the watch itself, just like you might with a phone. That makes them very extensible and customizable — you can easily make the watch look unique and do the things you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIDiQN"&gt;The OnePlus Watch, on the other hand (or wrist?), runs its own proprietary software, based on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system"&gt;real-time operating system&lt;/a&gt;. This software is very quick and power efficient, but it is not extensible — there’s no app store or third-party watchfaces to download on the OnePlus Watch. It’s similar to the software on the budget smartwatches you can get on Amazon; if you’ve ever used an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Smartwatch-Storage-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant/dp/B08HR91GQB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazfit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/UMIDIGI-Uwatch-2S-Waterproof-Smartwatch/dp/B08DCPKCHV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Umidigi&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-watch.html"&gt;Wyze watch&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve used a real-time operating system. The OnePlus Watch is not very different from those in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCN2Ou"&gt;This choice of platform affords the OnePlus Watch its greatest strength, long battery life, and also its greatest weakness: it just doesn’t do all that much compared to other smartwatches you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AxjHQN2FGup3x8v00jutddG9PI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436131/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch looks like many other smartwatches, but most especially the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5Jq16X"&gt;OnePlus Watch software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qLm1cu"&gt;The OnePlus Watch pairs with and is controlled by the OnePlus Health app for Android — there’s no iPhone compatibility at all. But you don’t need to own a OnePlus phone, it works with basically any modern Android device. I tested it on both OnePlus and Samsung smartphones and the experience was the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHDLxw"&gt;The app is where you can see what health and fitness metrics the watch has recorded, adjust which apps send notifications on your wrist, and view the available watchfaces. OnePlus has about 50 watchfaces so far, with some offering limited customizability in the form of selectable shortcuts or widgets, such as a weather widget, date, or shortcut to a built-in app like the timer. You can choose up to 14 faces to store on the watch and switch between them without using your phone. The company says it plans on adding more in the future, but as I mentioned earlier, there are no options for third-party watchfaces or third-party app widgets like you get with Samsung, Wear OS, or Apple smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mfmvuh"&gt;The watchfaces themselves are what you’d expect: there is the assortment of analog and digital styles to choose from, with some showing more information about your activity than others. I’m not a big fan of the analog options, so I settled on a digital face. Unfortunately, there’s a bug where digital watchfaces on the OnePlus Watch are stuck in 24-hour time and can’t show 12-hour time. The company tells me it is aware of this bug, and it is slated to be fixed “this month.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IziKEX7cLRFNO3bHwIpR6ZRbI2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436124/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch’s interface mimics Wear OS and is easy to navigate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0nWfJg"&gt;The watch interface has a familiar layout: swipe down for settings, swipe up to see notifications, press the side button to see your apps. You can swipe right from the watchface to access basic widgets for music control, weather, and activity tracking, similar to Wear OS or a Samsung watch. The design of the interface all looks mostly fine, and there thankfully aren’t any stutters or lags when navigating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaOrPI"&gt;I do have a few gripes with how notifications are handled. You can’t clear notifications by just swiping them away, like you can with every other smartwatch. Instead, you have to tap into each one and then press clear or scroll to the bottom to clear them all. It’s a clumsy and fiddly process. The OnePlus Watch doesn’t always sync with the notifications I’ve cleared on my phone, either, and occasionally notifications for the same messages would get duplicated, forcing me to see the same alerts more than once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0nbDs"&gt;You can’t do much with those notifications, either. There are no actions you can take other than clearing them from your wrist. OnePlus supports canned message replies in just five apps: WhatsApp, Telegram, Line, Discord, and Facebook Messenger. Notably and frustratingly, that list doesn’t include standard SMS messages. On top of that, there are only four basic replies to choose from: “OK”; “Be right there!”; “In a meeting, contact you later”; and “I’m driving, contact you later.” I frequently use a smartwatch to triage notifications, delete incoming emails, or reply to messages when I’m away from my desk, but I can’t do most of those things with the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch supports quick replies in just five apps and there are only four replies to choose from — you cannot use your voice to dictate something to the watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/udXA5vQWPe7cJYBH4ApRMSV0xIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436125/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch does not support third-party apps, what you get is what you get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3CSp2L"&gt;The OnePlus Watch comes with a basic set of apps: weather, timer, stopwatch, alarm, workout, sleep tracking, etc. Oddly, it doesn’t have a calculator or a calendar app, so I can’t easily see my next meeting or appointment, something I do a lot with other smartwatches. There’s no way to get your next appointment on your watchface, either. And since there isn’t an app store, I can’t add any apps to that list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yysc4Z"&gt;You can forget about streaming music from Spotify or playing podcasts through your favorite app — the only thing you can do with the OnePlus Watch is control what’s playing on your phone or transfer MP3 files from your phone to the watch’s 4GB of storage. Want to track your runs with Strava or MapMyFitness instead of OnePlus’ app? Sorry, no dice. If you want to control smart home devices from your wrist, the OnePlus Watch is entirely useless unless you have a OnePlus TV, where you can use it as a remote. The OnePlus TV is only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/26/20884862/oneplus-tv-announced-specs-india"&gt;available in India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bEnAm"&gt;The OnePlus Watch also lacks a voice assistant. I can’t ask it to start a timer when I’m in the kitchen and my hands are dirty, I can’t ask it to turn the lights off or open my garage door, and I can’t dictate a reply to an incoming message. How well voice assistants work varies greatly between smartwatches (Siri on the Apple Watch, pretty good! Bixby on a Samsung watch, less so), but OnePlus isn’t even trying here and I’ve missed having one available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5iLWI"&gt;Lastly, even though the OnePlus Watch has an NFC radio, it does not support mobile payments. You can’t tap your wrist to pay for something like you can with an Apple Watch, Samsung watch, or Wear OS smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tCc5-sReTjPNPn2QHrZxcWMH7D0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438877/vpavic_4521_20210409_0063.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch’s fitness tracking features hit the standard beats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="62bvpC"&gt;OnePlus Watch fitness tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0nrmub"&gt;The fitness tracking features are quite basic. It will track your steps throughout the day; the watch will nudge you to get up and move when you’ve been sitting for too long; you can choose between 14 different workouts for the watch to track; and if you wear the OnePlus Watch to bed, it will make an attempt to track your sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GH61fh"&gt;I’m not a gym rat, but I did wear the OnePlus Watch on my left wrist with a Fitbit Inspire HR on my right wrist throughout this review and the OnePlus counted thousands fewer steps than the Fitbit every day. None of these devices are perfect with their step tracking, but that kind of discrepancy is going to make tracking a longer-distance run or other intense workout inaccurate or just plain hard to do. I asked a few other reviewers I know who are also testing the OnePlus Watch and each one has had the same issues with inaccurate step counting. OnePlus says a bug fix for GPS optimization and to add more workout modes will be available sometime in mid-April.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrDsaiWghDdQLtPQM61SUAoi_28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436137/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the OnePlus Watch frequently undercounted my steps, it overestimated how much I slept each night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mzSWlk"&gt;Sleep tracking, oddly enough, has the opposite problem. The OnePlus Watch consistently overestimates how long I slept each night compared to the Fitbit and Google’s Nest Hub. A bug has also prevented the Watch from syncing its sleep data with the OnePlus Health app, even though other activity synced over fine. The company says this bug should also be fixed sometime this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIcHik"&gt;As mentioned earlier, you can’t use other fitness apps on the OnePlus Watch. The OnePlus Health app provides syncing with the Google Fit platform, so it’s possible you could cobble together a syncing solution between other apps using Fit as glue, but I did not test this. In general, the OnePlus Watch’s fitness tracking is fine for basic activity trends, but any fitness enthusiasts will want something more capable and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upJaG882X8BSnfj6iRDYwLGXGnY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436134/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch only comes in one size: a large 46mm face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="17033p"&gt;OnePlus Watch hardware and design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="e1ROrq"&gt;In terms of design, the OnePlus Watch is generic-looking — it reminds me a lot of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active line. It’s got a round face, there are two buttons on the side, and the body is made of polished stainless steel, which is nice to see at this price point. It comes in silver, black, or a gold-colored special edition — I’ve got the black model and it’s a little boring to look at. Either way, the hardware is solid and put together well — it’s not creaky or plasticky, and there are no rough edges to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="3xpwsk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10442966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h4BCwe"&gt;OnePlus is only offering the watch in one size, 46mm, and frankly, it’s big. It’s bigger than I like watches to be on my wrist, and if you have smaller wrists than me you’re not going to have a fun time with this. On the plus side, it’s not the thickest smartwatch I’ve ever worn. Just one size band comes in the box — OnePlus says that customers who need a shorter band will be able to get one by contacting customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2goU9"&gt;The touchscreen is a 1.39-inch 454 x 454 OLED that’s easy to see both indoors and out. It’s colorful, like you’d expect an OLED to be, but there’s no always-on display option, which nearly every other smartwatch has now. That makes it that much more annoying to check the time, though the wrist turn gesture does work well to wake it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grr22K"&gt;On the underside are the sensors for heart rate and blood oxygen. As usual, you should not use these sensors for medical purposes — and blood oxygen monitors on even the best smartwatches notoriously struggle with giving accurate readings. Inside the watch are the accelerometers and gyroscopes necessary to track your activity and workouts, plus GPS and Bluetooth radios. There’s no Wi-Fi or LTE here — if you leave your phone behind, you’re going to miss notifications and alerts until the watch is back in Bluetooth range of your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3UPut"&gt;Also missing from the OnePlus Watch are any rotating bezels or crowns — the only way to interact with it is to tap and swipe on the screen itself or push the buttons on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddUR7s"&gt;Even though it doesn’t have a voice assistant, the OnePlus Watch does have a microphone and speaker, so you can answer calls from your wrist via Bluetooth. It worked fine in my tests; callers said I sounded clear to them, but the speaker on the watch is a bit crackly at full volume. It works in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cF4fTl7v_14ozNWsXGgJBeRI8b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436141/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_19.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch has exceptional battery life and charges very quickly on its included charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CG0epx"&gt;The best thing about the OnePlus Watch is its battery life. OnePlus claims up to 14 days of usage between charges — it lasted about 10 days for me, wearing it day and night. Charging the watch is also quick and easy: just 20 minutes on the charger adds half a charge, which translates to literal days of usage. No Apple, Samsung, or Wear OS watch can last this long or charge this quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDLEdz"&gt;But at the same time, the OnePlus Watch has such great battery life because, frankly, it just does less than those other smartwatches. The best comparison I can make is that the OnePlus Watch is a fitness tracker in a smartwatch body, which would be an acceptable premise if it were a better fitness tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFwAW-tP8MMRljDacGE8Rtzvgdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22436135/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are about 50 different watchfaces to choose from for the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="J1JDG7"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DzdEi4"&gt;The OnePlus Watch may look like a lot of other smartwatches, but I can’t say it compares well to them. It’s limited in features, only comes in one size, and as I’ve gone over, there are several bugs with it that make it feel like an unfinished product. Aside from its long battery life, the OnePlus Watch’s bestselling point is its low price, which is half that of a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and over $100 less than the comparably sized Galaxy Watch Active 2. But if you’re looking for a smartwatch for your Android phone, it’s not that hard to find Wear OS models on sale, often for less than the cost of the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YtpoMr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The OnePlus Watch needs to do more to earn its place on my wrist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EYx6FL"&gt;For me, a good smartwatch is a lot like a personal assistant on my wrist. It tells me the time, when my next calendar appointment is, what the weather is like, and how active I’ve been throughout the day. I can quickly ask it to set a timer when I’m making a cup of tea or use it to reply to a message from my spouse when I’m running an errand. It also lets me customize its appearance and capabilities through third-party apps, watchfaces, or both. For others, it’s a way to track workouts and keep on top of their personal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BcGvu0"&gt;In that framing, the OnePlus Watch isn’t really a smartwatch and based on my experience, it isn’t a great fitness tracker either. Instead, it’s just a clever watch, and it can be useful if your expectations of it are low. But if a smartwatch is going to take up real estate on my wrist, it has to be more useful than the OnePlus Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Siri says next Apple event is April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWBAavh_ooh4qTkAo7hiYd9UWKI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117300/image__5_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asking Siri, “When is the next Apple Event” generates the following response.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DMxULF"&gt;Siri appears to have spilled the beans on the next Apple launch event. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;asking the voice assistant “When is the next Apple Event” prompts it to say April 20th. We’ve managed to get the same response, though only on a device that’s associated with a US Apple ID. Apple typically announces its events with invites sent out a week in advance, meaning the news should become official later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDVUxr"&gt;“The special event is on Tuesday, April 20th, at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA. You can get all the details on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FApple.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381336%2Fsiri-apple-event-april-20th-ipad-pro-announcement-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt;” says Siri. Tapping the link takes you to the standard &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381336%2Fsiri-apple-event-april-20th-ipad-pro-announcement-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Event landing page&lt;/a&gt;, where the launch isn’t listed. It seems odd that the response claims the event is happening in Cupertino, since this will almost certainly be another of Apple’s pre-recorded online-only events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DloBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The special event is on Tuesday, April 20th, at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jPQCrH"&gt;The message itself doesn’t give any hints about what Apple might be planning to announce at the event. However, recent rumors point towards new iPad Pro models, at least. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; new iPad Pros will debut in April. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will reportedly be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;Apple’s first device with a Mini LED screen&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to offer a high contrast ratio without the risk of burn-in associated with OLED displays. Reports indicate that the new iPad Pros could be in short supply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;due to production issues&lt;/a&gt; Apple is facing with the Mini LED displays. Other rumored iPad Pro upgrades include new processors with a similar amount of power to the M1 chip found in Apple’s recent MacBooks, better cameras, and USB-C ports with faster transfer speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZniWj"&gt;There are rumors that Apple is also close to launching its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt;. The location tracking devices, which should allow users to keep track of items using Apple’s Find My software, were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;expected to launch last year&lt;/a&gt; but ultimately never appeared. With Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;recently opening up its Find My network&lt;/a&gt; to track items from third-party companies, the stage is now set for the launch of its own physical trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCdU3B"&gt;Unless Siri is lying, the invitations should arrive imminently.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Quantum 2 has quantum cryptography built in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrYlX1bpoTaEsCDXGHFFrnhDoIA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117262/_Photo__SKT_to_Launch_QRNG_Powered_5G_Smartphone_Galaxy_Quantum2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oD1Wz8"&gt;Samsung and South Korean carrier SK Telecom have announced the Galaxy Quantum 2, Samsung’s second phone that features built-in quantum cryptography technology for increased security. It’s the follow-up to last year’s Galaxy A Quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka7P1O"&gt;The Quantum 2 includes a chip developed by a company called ID Quantique, which says it’s the world’s smallest quantum random number generator (QRNG) at 2.5mm square. It works by capturing random noise with an LED and a CMOS image sensor. According to SK Telecom, the QRNG chip “allows smartphone holders to use services that require security in a more safe and secure manner by generating unpredictable and patternless true random numbers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4QGTZ"&gt;Quantum cryptography RNG is considered to be extremely challenging to hack without extensive physical access to a given device. The benefits will seem pretty niche to the average customer, but the QRNG chip does automatically work with apps that use the Android Keystore APIs, which should make the technology more accessible for developers. SK Telecom is touting local compatibility with the likes of Shinhan Bank and Standard Chartered Bank Korea, plus its own services like T World. The carrier says it’ll work with more services in the future, including Samsung’s own credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6b3mCn"&gt;The phone itself has reasonably high specs, close to what you’d have found in a high-end flagship phone from a year or two ago. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, a 64-megapixel camera, and a 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arWTr7"&gt;The Galaxy Quantum 2 is only confirmed for a release in South Korea right now. It’ll go on sale on April 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4HM3F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Disney’s ‘real’ lightsaber patent actually works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V6ZLQAZEJHiRfZx8KGG-mA5KDto=/0x0:693x462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117120/josh_d_amaro_lightsaber.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_xISgAjp5a/" target="_blank"&gt;Josh D’Amaro (Instagram)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUus05"&gt;A real lightsaber. How is that possible? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgwXmQ"&gt;It’s probably not, of course. But when Disney Parks chairman Josh D’Amaro ended his April 8th presentation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/9/22375720/disney-parks-lightsaber-retractable-blade-rumor-patent"&gt;by whipping out a never-before-seen retractable lightsaber&lt;/a&gt; — no video evidence, mind — Disney and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans went wild online. Speculation ran rampant, much of it pointing &lt;a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10065127B1/en"&gt;to a 2018 patent&lt;/a&gt; for a “Sword device with retractable, internally illuminated blade.” I pored through that patent late that evening, and I’ve been trying to figure out a way to show &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers how it works ever since. Heck, I even ordered a pair of LED slap bracelets that have yet to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOitWf"&gt;But it looks like I won’t need them, because VR developer Ben Ridout &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benridout/status/1381412831707422721"&gt;has already done better&lt;/a&gt;, brilliantly illuminating Disney’s patented concept with a set of simple animations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cf6Lj1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Disney?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Disney&lt;/a&gt; invent a real working &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lightsaber?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#lightsaber&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes they did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It won't melt through metal blast doors, or cut off your hand, but it does feature an illuminated blade that will extend and retract at the push of a button. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This animation shows the concept behind the tech. &lt;a href="https://t.co/e7fwP06CxF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/e7fwP06CxF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Ridout (@benridout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benridout/status/1381412831707422721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HRdWz4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Next, widen the tapes and increase the curve, allowing them to partially wrap around each other and form a complete cylinder. Drive this system with a motor so both reels can be extended and retracted in synch at the push of a button. Now, you've got a lightsaber! &lt;a href="https://t.co/B3lLMmclDN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B3lLMmclDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Ridout (@benridout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benridout/status/1381412847054360576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SjAl5r"&gt;Yes, that’s correct — the magic here really does boil down to a pair of fancy motorized tape measures. The patent even mentions “a metal carpenter’s tape measure” as inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vTjESF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10443399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXG82S"&gt;According to the patent, the lightsaber’s “blade” consists of two spools of translucent material that lie flat when fully wound, like a tape measure inside its reel. When each ribbon is shot out the end, it curves into a semicircle that forms one half of the blade. They’re permanently mounted to a rounded lightsaber “tip” that also pulls along a string of flexible LEDs that’s mounted on a third motorized spool inside the lightsaber’s frame. The two halves of the blade get zipped together by a “blade form” as they exit the lightsaber, creating a single lightsaber beam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g9UN59"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Building the ultimate Star Wars lightsaber|7799" data-volume-uuid="5a56bbf90" data-volume-id="7799" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-59" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YhCxp0"&gt;Will such a lightsaber be rigid enough for a practice duel? Only Disney’s Imagineers can say for sure — but either way, this could be a gamechanger for the lightsaber community. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/10/11371902/star-wars-lightsaber-fx-sabers-custom-luke-skywalker-graflex"&gt;We went on a hunt for the ultimate Star Wars lightsabers in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and while modern lightsaber props have incredible light, sound and detailing, the basics haven’t changed in years: you generally choose between a glorified flashlight with a toy telescoping blade that can actually fit inside a handle, or more commonly now, a rigid LED-filled tube you’ll have to remove and store whenever you want to display your saber on a belt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWF7k1"&gt;Now, Disney may have created the full-size, evenly lit, disappearing lightsaber blade of our dreams. Minus the whole “slice objects in half with a beam of energy” part, of course. I’m just wondering whether it’ll be a prop for Disneyland actors, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376256/hasbro-700-optimus-prime-toy-transform-motor-automatic-voice-command"&gt;the latest incredible toy I can’t quite afford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It may be curtains for Arclight and Pacific, the theaters I’ve only dreamt of attending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Los Angeles Amid Coronavirus Outbreak" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i1Gc25N1dYbXtDeEc8kqWokGuSg=/181x0:4665x2989/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116853/1219631225.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Livingston/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="shBPHs"&gt;The owner of famous movie theater chains Arclight Cinemas and Pacific Theaters has revealed that the theaters will never reopen from their COVID shutdowns, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/arclight-cinemas-pacific-theatres-covid-1234949832/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Decurian, the company that operates both chains, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/arclight-cinemas-and-pacific-theatres-wont-be-reopening-1234732936/"&gt;gave a dire statement to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it includes phrases like “exhausted all potential options” and “does not have a viable way forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3Sa4j"&gt;I don’t live in California, and I’ve never seen a movie at either an Arclight or Pacific, but their shuttering hurts me deeply: I’ve always hoped to see a movie at an Arclight and experience Pacific’s Cinerama Dome, and it seems like I may never have the opportunity. (Those aren’t my only movie dreams in distress: the dinner and a show chain I’ve hoped to visit, Alamo Drafthouse, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/alamo-drafthouse-bankruptcy-chapter-11-sale-1234920558/"&gt;has recently filed for bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s854rK"&gt;I’m aware that most people probably don’t dream of traveling to other states just to see a movie, but these chains have long been considered the gold-standard in the online filmmaking community. I’ve long heard about Arclight Cinemas’ top-tier picture and sound, and many of them were located in the heart of Hollywood. Tinseltown is feeling the loss too, with many actors and filmmakers tweeting in despair (or in the hopes that someone else will buy the theaters and restore them to operation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aa7It6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Difficult to process this news. Truly devastating. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArcLightCinemas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ArcLightCinemas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/qymeJ2StI1"&gt;https://t.co/qymeJ2StI1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elijah Wood (@elijahwood) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elijahwood/status/1381762753296097280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wKNxYC"&gt;There’s also the matter of the Cinerama Dome. The famous Hollywood theater is named after a famous 70mm film format (one of the many that came about as theaters tried to lure in viewers with ever-increasing spectacle). As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i12oWm3v6Ho"&gt;any film nerd will tell you&lt;/a&gt;, 70mm is pretty much the ultimate in movie-exhibition, whether you’re watching &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WbNPN"&gt;The latter is a movie my dad introduced me to, and I would’ve loved to see it in its original format — getting my eyes on original film prints has kind of been an obsession ever since I got to watch Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats &lt;/em&gt;back in college, but now &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinerama#Legacy"&gt;the list of US theaters&lt;/a&gt; that can even play Cinerama movies is vanishingly small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ZREc"&gt;What will happen to these theaters remains unknown. The buildings won’t instantly crumble just because the company that owns them is shutting down, but without someone to take care of them they may not last. This would be an additional tragedy in the case of the Cinerama Dome — Silicon Valley &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/21/5628202/sunset-on-the-domes"&gt;got rid of the rest of its dome-shaped theaters&lt;/a&gt;, and partly justified it with the fact that Cinerama would still be around to keep the tradition alive. While the Cinerama Dome and Silicon Valley’s Century 21 dome are both historical landmarks, that doesn’t always mean preserving its purpose: &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/07/30/federal-realty-investment-trust-santana-row-office.html"&gt;last we checked&lt;/a&gt;, the Silicon Valley dome was slated to become an “innovation hub” inside a new tech office campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICbkki"&gt;Speaking of tragedies, it’s worth keeping things in perspective: while I may not get to experience these theaters, there are many Pacific and Arclight employees who have just lost their jobs, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. If I had one wish (that was, hypothetically, strictly limited to this specific situation), it’d be that those people could find good jobs at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326343/los-angeles-la-movie-theaters-reopen-movie-capitol"&gt;other theater chains&lt;/a&gt; that are opening back up. But if I had two, I’d love to make sure that these theaters somehow survive, so I could someday visit them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s follow up to the Z Fold 2 could be smaller, but maybe not in the dimension you want</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5HaK0iuv9C7whGTmTMSI2pFSaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116445/vpavic_200907_4181_0010_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8ZMiY"&gt;Samsung’s next Galaxy Z Fold folding phone might have a slightly smaller screen than its previous models, feature a smaller battery, and quite possibly launch in July alongside a new Galaxy Z Flip, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11865"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-3-will-reportedly-be-smaller-than-the-galaxy-z-fold-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CmxEB"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will reportedly have a 7.5-inch main tablet screen and a 6.2-inch screen on the front cover of the phone, &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; writes, which would be virtually the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;the Fold 2’s&lt;/a&gt; 7.6-inch main display and 6.2-inch cover display. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; says these screen sizes come with the added benefit of “zero bezels,” so even though the screens may be the same size, the third Fold could feel slightly smaller because the actual body of the phone might shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiiEB"&gt;In comparison to the Fold 2’s 4,500mAh battery, the Fold 3 will reportedly make do with a slightly smaller 4,380mAh battery. Again, not a dramatic change in size and it might not even noticeably impact battery life, but it’s interesting to note if it effects other changes to the Fold’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uujIi-TwtsLqEJjklQdTF3pllPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439698/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_4.30.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even with a slight taper, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is still almost as thick as two phones back to back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzwyn"&gt;There’s other rumored changes to the Fold line, including the possibility of S Pen support, just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra got earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. For the Fold, a stylus could also pose additional challenges if Samsung tries to integrate stylus storage directly in the phone rather than using an add-on case like the Ultra. A hole for a stylus could take up space that could be filled with extra battery capacity or removed entirely for an overall thinner phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF37JS"&gt;And — though &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t mention it at all, so don’t expect a change — thinness is the dimension that might actually matter when it comes to a new Galaxy Fold. Including the extra gap created by its hinge, the Fold 2 is about two S21 Ultra thick when folded. If Samsung isn’t thinning out the rumored Fold 3 to make it easier to hold and fit in a pocket, I hope they’ll consider that the next time around: it could also help Samsung compete with newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s Mate X2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt; which both use similar folding designs and are already thinner than the Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC market isn’t slowing down after an amazing 2020, despite chip shortages  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wz2tdsJ1oqgQY-io0AdhW15c594=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116431/akrales_190930_3689_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bc9WpY"&gt;The PC market had a great first quarter, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;the global shortage of semiconductor chips&lt;/a&gt;. Research firm &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-32-percent-in-first-quarter-of-2021"&gt;Gartner estimates&lt;/a&gt; that shipments of “traditional PCs,” meaning laptops and desktops, are up by 32 percent compared to Q1 2020 (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/pc-market-had-best-q1-since-2015-fastest-growth-in-20-years-gartner.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47601721"&gt;IDC puts the number even higher&lt;/a&gt;, estimating 55 percent growth year-over-year. This seems to be the continuation of a trend — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;the PC market had a great 2020 as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpJGl8"&gt;Both firms agree that the growth is atypical — Gartner says that the growth is the fastest it’s seen since it started tracking the market in 2000, and IDC says that the drop in shipments from Q4 to Q1 is the smallest it’s seen since 2012. The raw numbers are also impressive — Gartner estimates that just under 70 million PCs were shipped, while IDC estimates around 84 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sxVCmi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The return to normalcy on the horizon may affect people’s buying habits in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P253JZ"&gt;Of course, these numbers don’t exist in a vacuum — you may have already realized that the time period being compared against, Q1 2020, was rough for... well, everything, which includes the manufacturing and shipping of PCs. But while the growth comparison is definitely tilted in favor of Q1 2021, both firms estimate that the numbers could’ve been even higher, had it not been for the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gfFfq"&gt;The silicon shortage has affected almost everything, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;trucks and cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;consoles&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;gaming PC component&lt;/a&gt; market. There are even reports that Apple has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;delay production of MacBooks and iPads&lt;/a&gt;. IDC points out that the shortage has contributed to higher average prices in the PC market, and that the shortages are likely to make PCs more difficult to get for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id1pNg"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the pandemic is also likely affecting demand, and the return to normalcy on the horizon may affect people’s buying habits in future quarters. Whether demand will stick around or not isn’t certain, but both IDC and Gartner seem to think it will. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three reasons why Epic Games can give away $17.5 billion worth of games for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvfU3GQnahA-iOIcb3mplYLk_yU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69116402/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CkT5Sc"&gt;The Epic Games Store gives away free games every week — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;often good ones&lt;/a&gt; — and yet the company has never explained how it’s managed to dole out 749 million copies without going bankrupt. Until now. New documents published as part of the legal discovery process for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Epic’s major antitrust lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt; were published last week, and between those and a series of tweets from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, we’re getting our best look yet at how the company’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; throwing billions of dollars away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8g7ypF"&gt;It’s not spending as much as you’d think &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7qeuGW"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/405/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/"&gt;Apple’s “proposed findings of fact” document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-10-epic-is-burning-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-on-epic-games-store-exclusives-in-its-war-against-steam"&gt;credit to &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for spotting some of this over the weekend), Epic Games &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; losing cash — hundreds of millions of dollars in “minimum guarantees” it pays many developers to give away their games and constantly offer new ones to keep players coming back. That money also covers Epic’s infamous exclusivity deals, so it’s not clear how much goes to the free games alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVoUqn"&gt;Either way, it’s a sizable fraction of a billion dollars that Epic’s losing here: $330 million, it seems. “Epic committed $444 million in minimum guarantees for 2020 alone,” reads Apple’s legal filing. “That includes at least $330 million in unrecouped costs from minimum guarantees alone.” But both of those numbers are far, far less than the retail value of those games: $17.5 billion, if you do the math based on Epic CEO Tim Sweeney’s chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eNKwyk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple spins this as “losing money”, but spending now in order to build a great, profitable business in the future is exactly what investment is! It’s equally true whether you’re building a factory, a store, or a game.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381021998692892676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksaWxb"&gt;How is it paying only a fraction of a billion for both exclusives &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;freebies, when the freebies alone should cost many billions? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381109913112489987"&gt;Sweeney revealed on April 10th&lt;/a&gt; that Epic doesn’t actually pay a fee per game at all, much less the full amount: “Our free game giveaways are negotiated with developers where we pay them an agreed dollar amount, not per copy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEqyBH"&gt;Epic, and Sweeney, are willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into the platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bR88ap"&gt;As you can see in Sweeney’s other tweet above, Epic isn’t expecting to make that money back: the studio has intentionally set aside that huge, nearly half-billion pile of cash to entice developers, and the company thinks it’s working just fine. Sweeney publicly declared his support for those costs on Twitter over the weekend: “[The Epic Games Store] has proven to be a fantastic success in reaching gamers with great games and a fantastic investment into growing the business!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnsHrF"&gt;Theoretically, the constant stream of new games may keep more players using the Epic Games Store and, eventually, maybe even spend their own money on games there. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254901/epic-games-store-accounts-daily-monthly-active-concurrent-users-storefront-2020-data"&gt;claims it’s already seen that borne out in the store’s rapid growth&lt;/a&gt;, saying players have spent more than $700 million on the store, with $265 million of that spent on games &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; made by Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVhmUo"&gt;Fortnite is a cash cow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QYNrGw"&gt;While we don’t know exactly how much &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has made for Epic, it almost certainly is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of money: Epic earned more than $700 million on iOS alone &lt;em&gt;in just two years&lt;/em&gt;, according to Apple’s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7lGzyU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is pretty much how any company looks to disrupt an existing market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worth noting that while Epic Store loses $330m, Epic still generated approx $3.85bn in revenue and $1.54bn in gross profit (Thanks to Fortnite) according to a recent court document. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VZrbsFkyme"&gt;https://t.co/VZrbsFkyme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1381632911141654528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ptMb8"&gt;And although the game is no longer available on iOS because of Apple and Epic’s ongoing feud, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is still on many other platforms, and it seems like a safe bet that it’s still raking in a lot of cash everywhere else, giving Epic income as it gives away games on the Epic Games Store. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A robotic spacecraft just latched onto an active satellite in orbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image of Intelsat’s IS-10-02 satellite taken by Northrop’s MEV-2 as it approached for docking. | Northrop Grumman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4Fk6e"&gt;A robotic spacecraft from Northrop Grumman latched onto an old communications satellite in deep orbit and extended its lifespan by five more years. The Mission Extension Vehicle-2 (MEV-2) marked Northrop’s second successful docking of an object in space. The mission is part of the company’s efforts to kickstart an industry of life-extension services for dead, dying or errant satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0qCZW"&gt;MEV-2 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21366674/northrop-grumman-space-logistics-mev-2-satellite-servicing-life-extension"&gt;launched in August last year&lt;/a&gt; from French Guiana in South America. It spent six months raising its orbit to rendezvous with Intelsat’s 17-year-old communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit, more than 22,000 miles from Earth. That satellite was running out of fuel and was getting old; it had operated far beyond its expected lifespan while still providing broadband communications to three continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjKNew"&gt;On March 12th, the MEV-2 craft started a month-long docking process with the Intelsat satellite. Docking was completed and confirmed successful by Northrop Grumman today at 1:34PM ET. It “was every bit as exciting and successful as the docking of MEV-1,” Joe Anderson, vice president of business development at SpaceLogistics, the Northrop subsidiary that launches MEVs, said during a press conference on Monday. Now, Intelsat’s IS-10-02 satellite can carry on beaming broadband communications to South America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/otvPQh0rzs83W45AvIkA8bknapI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439519/MEP_CV.4k4.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N2zgDU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154426/commercial-satellites-docking-space-northrop-grumman-intelsat"&gt;MEV-1 was Northrop’s first docking success&lt;/a&gt; last year, a breakthrough in its goal to spruce up dead or dying satellites and save satellite operators the cost of replacing them altogether. Extending the lifetime of satellites also helps tamp down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20991798/space-debris-low-earth-orbit-satellites-mega-constellations-collisions-graph"&gt;space junk&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17906158/nasa-spacex-oneweb-satellite-large-constellations-orbital-debris"&gt;growing problem&lt;/a&gt; in orbit as the world launches record amounts of satellites to space each year. De-orbiting a satellite from geosynchronous orbit could take decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYZDgQ"&gt;The Northrop-Intelsat servicing contract was a “win-win situation,” said Jean-Luc Froeliger, a vice president at Intelsat, during a press conference on Monday. The IS-10-02 satellite was performing well, Froeliger said, but without Northrop’s MEV-2, they would’ve had to deorbit it because it was running low on fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhMjHa"&gt;MEV-2 is currently clamped to the back of IS-10-02, serving as the satellite’s life support by providing renewed power and navigation control. The two will operate as a “combined stack” for the next five years. After that, MEV-2 will undock from IS-10-02 and set off to rendezvous with another client satellite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PmrI1"&gt;IS-10-02 will die after MEV-2 leaves. A company spokeswoman said the satellite will retire to a “graveyard orbit,” or the place in space where old satellites can turn into space junk without getting in the way of younger satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XC05l"&gt;Northrop is also building an upgraded satellite servicing system called a Mission Robotic Vehicle (or MRV). That spacecraft will meet up with aging satellites to install orbital first-aid kits called Mission Extension Pods, designed to provide propulsion and power. Each MRV can carry six pods. MRV’s debut launch is slated for early 2024, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3zXaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Monday 7:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story was updated to add Intelsat’s response to a question regarding the fate of IS-10-02 after MEV-2 leaves. It will die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDOt7M"&gt;The Google Play Movies and TV app will no longer be available on any Roku set-top box or any Samsung, LG, Vizio or Roku smart TV starting July 15th, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/102498448?hl=en"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/12/google-play-movies-roku-samsung-lg-vizio/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you have movies or TV shows purchased or rented through the service, you’ll still be able to access them through the “Your movies and shows” section of the YouTube app on those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSkCjI"&gt;This change will also affect you if if you used the Movies and TV app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/13/16464000/how-to-use-movies-anywhere-app-features"&gt;to access Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, the service that allows you to redeem codes from DVDs and Blu-rays so you can access your media digitally. Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that users who relied on Play Movies and TV to access that content will be able to do so through YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phbyYj"&gt;There are a few other caveats to note in the transition to YouTube. Your Watchlist will no longer be viewable in the app (though it can still be seen on the web by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=my%20watchlist"&gt;Googling “my watchlist”&lt;/a&gt;), and while your family can still share the content you bought from the Movie and TV store, any purchases made in the YouTube app won’t be shared with your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsSFks"&gt;If you have movies or TV content purchased through the Play Store, here’s how you’ll be able to access them after July 15th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8GHnkC"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Android phones/tablets: &lt;/strong&gt;using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21492549/google-tv-app-play-movies-name-change-chromecast"&gt;the Google TV app&lt;/a&gt; or the YouTube app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nXvYjF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On iPhones/iPads:&lt;/strong&gt; using the Google Play Movies and TV app, or the YouTube App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JMy9en"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Roku devices: &lt;/strong&gt;using the YouTube app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="re2aJ5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Samsung, LG, Vizio, and Roku smart TVs:&lt;/strong&gt; using the YouTube app &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Fkiq6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Chromecast:&lt;/strong&gt; using the Google TV app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bglTXt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On the web: &lt;/strong&gt;using the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/movies"&gt;Google Play Movies and TV website&lt;/a&gt; or YouTube website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6c1Vsf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Android TV: &lt;/strong&gt;using the Google Play Movies and TV&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;app (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidtv/answer/6111147?hl=en"&gt;according to Google’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4L4h1l"&gt;To view your content on YouTube, log in, go to Library, then tap “Your movies and shows.” There, you’ll see your Google Play Store movie and TV purchases, your Movies Anywhere content, and any content purchased from within the YouTube app itself (with the family sharing caveat noted above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFx7S4"&gt;Transitioning from one app to another can be tough, but Google is hoping to take some of the sting away for users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liliputingnews/status/1381704020826451974"&gt;by offering&lt;/a&gt; them a gift code that can be applied to their next movie or TV purchase — though you’ll have to redeem it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google is shutting down the Google Play Movies &amp;amp; TV apps for Roku, Samsung, LG, and Vizio smart TVs on June 15, but past purchases should be available in the YouTube apps for those platforms, and you can use Play credits with YouTube. Watchlists won't transfer though. &lt;a href="https://t.co/WJh0qAYTPg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WJh0qAYTPg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Liliputing (@liliputingnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liliputingnews/status/1381704020826451974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
