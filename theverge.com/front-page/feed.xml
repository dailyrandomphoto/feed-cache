    <title>Razer’s excellent Basilisk V3 mouse is selling for its best price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEIbpk"&gt;We’re starting the weekend with some exciting news for gamers: our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;pick for the best wired gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is now available for its lowest price to date. For only the third time, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling Razer’s Basilisk V3 for just $59.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $69.99. The comfortable mouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;delivers notable improvements&lt;/a&gt; over its predecessor, particularly in regards to its scroll wheel. Depending upon how hard your scroll, the mouse can switch between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes, which make it easier to scroll down the page more freely — a perk that comes in handy even if you’re not using the mouse for gaming. It also touts a 26K DPI sensor, RGB lighting, and 11 programmable buttons, so you can adjust the controls to your liking within Razer’s Synapse software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjkAwO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ChiQ"&gt;If you’re on the market for a pair of affordable true wireless earbuds, today we’re seeing some great discounts on both the new Jabra Elite 3 earbuds &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Jabra’s older Elite 75t. Already considered Jabra’s budget buds, the Elite 3 typically retail for $79.99 but are on sale today for $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built/dp/B09B45T59G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVt4AzUUic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Chris Welch praised the earbuds, noting that they sound better than he expected given their price. He was also impressed by their performance, decent call quality, no-fuss controls, and lengthy battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTXNHE"&gt;However, if you’re looking for wireless earbuds that offer features like noise cancellation, the $149.99 Elite 75t are also on sale at Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp0dUvFa7T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly matches their best price to date. While the noise cancellation on these isn’t quite as good as it is on the newer &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26374473.5227/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTQ5NTg3L2phYnJhLWVsaXRlLTg1dC1yZXZpZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtc3BlY3MtcHJpY2U/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb3df85a2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;, they both boast excellent sound with a good amount of bass. The Elite 75t are also comfortable and capable of connecting to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, a feature still not commonly found in many wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Elite 75t review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="pPy4Pw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XILdnP"&gt;Shifting from wireless earbuds to high-quality microphones, the $129.99 Blue Yeti mic is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in select colors for $99.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp5KfMrnfX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;; this includes the black model, which Amazon hasn’t discounted since July. While not its best price ever, this is the lowest we’ve seen the mic sell for since the holidays. A popular staple with podcasters, YouTubers, and Twitch streamers, the Yeti is capable of conforming to a number of different recording environments. It also allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio, rendering it one of the more versatile budget options out there for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lggHuR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904ZHRjPs"&gt;DJI’s Mavic Mini remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best drones you can buy for under $500&lt;/a&gt;, however, $450 is still a lot of money. Thankfully, if you’re looking for something more affordable, its 2019 predecessor is available today at Newegg with a handful of accessories. Right now, you can buy the last-gen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=TheVergeDailyDeals1152022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F380-0002-00345" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Mini Fly More Combo for just $299.99&lt;/a&gt;, a solid $100 discount. The bundle includes three sets of spare propellers, a carrying bag, a propeller guard, a gimbal protector, spare batteries, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-4643279180604848904Y1gSCr"&gt;Despite the fact the Mavic Mini is an older, more budget-friendly drone, it still shares many features in common with more expensive models, like a number of creative shooting modes and the ability to automatically return to its takeoff spot. It also doesn’t require FAA registration, a boon for experienced drone pilots and newcomers alike. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mEkTeZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T07o9o"&gt;Some other ways to save this weekend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AWG8HQ"&gt;If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, Amazon is selling a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online Family Membership and a SanDisk 128GB Micro SD card for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BT4MTZS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $34.99 (nearly $40 off&lt;/a&gt;), giving you a way to game online and expand your console’s storage space at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZwVNY7"&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods are still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the low price of $139.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. They originally sold for $179.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5OXiV"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock 2 with a built-in wireless charging pad &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgqmnNTjMYj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $64.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $89.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Why you might want a secure file-sharing service now that you’re working from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYPvkvxWjZliIvCdF13ieBjmUoA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70393577/VRG_ILL_4947_How_to_securely_share_files.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1F6FaM"&gt;When we were all at the office, many of us were connected to the office network. We didn’t need to give sharing files much thought. But now that we’re scattered across the landscape, securely sharing important files can take careful planning. Here’s why you might want to use powerful file-sharing services to share sensitive files safely, so you can collaborate better no matter where you’re working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI6AcM"&gt;Probably the easiest way to share a file is to just attach a document to an email, or to a Slack or other instant message. But either way invites trouble on several fronts. If you rely too much on your email or messaging system, your poorly archived files could become available to prying hackers with phishing lures. If you’re sharing traditional documents that way, you could also quickly find yourself playing the “who has the most current version” game. It’s hard to keep track of updates when multiple people are working on the same document, spreadsheet, or presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KTmqQy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Drive and OneDrive have their flaws, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ItmoN1"&gt;While built-in collaboration tools like Google Workspace or Microsoft OneDrive (or something equivalent based on your email identity) can solve the version control problem — and might be your only option if your company insists — they can become cumbersome the moment your team expands beyond your office domain. You might inadvertently share the document with people who shouldn’t see it, or lock someone out who needs access. The more convoluted you make your sharing situation, the greater the potential for a mistake where the world (or perhaps family members) gain access to your files. We’ve all seen the news stories where a database or collection of documents fell into the wrong hands because someone failed to apply the appropriate security. Some companies won’t risk it: With one of my clients, I had to get a new email address on their domain to share their Google Docs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM2M8W"&gt;Besides Google Workspace and OneDrive, there are more than a dozen different providers of personal file-sharing services, including Dropbox, Box, and Apple’s iCloud. Many of these are free or nearly so for minimal use. But if you are contemplating these services, everyone in your sharing circle should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;use two-factor authentication (such as Authy)&lt;/a&gt; to access them, not just a username and password. Even so, they’re often second-rate when it comes to user experience (Dropbox’s collaboration features can be confusing, iCloud and Windows have a complicated relationship, and Box’s file preview feature doesn’t do such a great job). They’re adequate for single-use sharing or sharing files across your own devices, but they’re  not my preferred solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XggY4j"&gt;Instead, you should consider an enterprise-grade cloud-based file-sharing service, one that adds more layers of protection by encrypting your data, and that has fine-tuned access control. Egnyte, SecureDocs, ShareFile, and SugarSync are just a few of the more popular services; here’s a chart with a rough comparison of how much they cost and what they offer to start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgDLgO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8g3IU1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10961845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sxwchA"&gt;Regardless of which one you pick, here’s what you should look for when researching a secure file-sharing service: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PfyXm2"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Automatic file sync &lt;/strong&gt;for all users on all devices, including integration with Windows Explorer and MacOS’s Finder, so you can browse shared directories and keep local copies for quick access. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BilKaE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Support for Android, iOS, and web clients &lt;/strong&gt;to browse shared directories and folders on the go as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZgCfTa"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;End-to-end encryption&lt;/strong&gt;. If someone manages to download your files without your login, they shouldn’t be able to do anything with them. ShareFile also has an Outlook plug-in that encrypts your files as an extra feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l7tmFa"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Additional login security&lt;/strong&gt;. SecureDocs requires additional authentication by default for all of its logins, while the others I mention have it as an option. Setting this up is as simple as scanning a QR code into a smartphone app, as shown below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2VFyRziAmpgigr7mk3It9vUEtpk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146000/qr_code_authenticator_setup.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ue6weu"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Easy-to-disable public sharing options&lt;/strong&gt;, or that they make it difficult to inadvertently choose to share publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mh9U3Z"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Customizable permissions and access rights&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that the right people are sharing the right file collections. Egnyte, for example, has numerous controls to add a password to your file, allow or disable downloads, and notifications, as you can see in the screenshot below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-GOMXrhLEId6W7LMm-lAmOS-M8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146003/access_control_egynte.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="unzfWf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Audit trails&lt;/strong&gt; to figure out and fix when someone accidentally shares a file with the entire internet, or so you can quickly remove a shared file if it is no longer needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk890e"&gt;Many of these products have free trials (of the ones I mention above, all but SugarSync don’t require any payment details), and you can use those periods to evaluate them. Asking yourself these questions should also help you pick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hIChok"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do you routinely share very large files&lt;/strong&gt;, such as videos or illustrated PowerPoint documents? Some services place limits on individual files; SugarSync, for instance, has a limit on web client upload size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ESW1cJ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What other software tools work with the file-sharing service&lt;/strong&gt;? Some (such as Egnyte) integrate with Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Slack, which makes sharing files easier to use as part of your normal workflows. Check the fine print if this is important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RvgWzm"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do you need a room&lt;/strong&gt;? Some services offer a common shared “data room” that can be the cloud equivalent of a shared network file server. ShareFile and SecureDocs both offer unlimited space for their shared rooms. Others, such as Egnyte, cap the room at 1TB, which is still a lot of storage if you’re not a video producer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UdZqKC"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What other specialized services do you need&lt;/strong&gt;? Some services integrate with e-signature apps (ShareFile works with Citrix’s RightSignature), allow for custom workflows (like document approvals) and other tasks that can be real time-savers in a corporate environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PLTqIr"&gt;Using any enterprise sharing service will take some adjustment, but I feel they are worth the effort to gain additional peace of mind, better security, and collaborative features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphone deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8ZQ6F2601Vo7AEwFugPl0G63SE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392555/bfarsace_190903_3639_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 headphones are just $241 instead of $399.99 at Adorama.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2yBGHO"&gt;With many people working from home than they used to, owning a good pair of noise-canceling headphones has become more appealing than ever. However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B19IV"&gt;That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L17MDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFH8rh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10961832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_nLgkBiQonGQmGOHNTMQMj8pn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21700256/IMG_0640_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 are the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GSgzPh"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XtIOrp"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is our overall pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. They offer excellent noise-canceling, good sound and voice quality, and the ability to pair to two devices simultaneously. You can wear these for long periods of time as well, as their plush ear pads make them comfortable to wear for as long as you need. They can even last up to 30 hours on a single charge and can be charged via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRoMJX"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the $349.99 headphones drop to $248 — their lowest price to date. They remained around that price throughout the holiday season, but, unfortunately, many retailers have since ended their sales. Some retailers, however, are offering bundle deals that are still worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE9AC9"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?subId1=TheVergeBestNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling the WH-1000XM4 with a 20,800mAh battery pack and a microfiber cleaning cloth for $348. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95, so this bundle is valued at around $390.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max is a good pick for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Yu5lCJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UfClp3"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sound quality you can get in a pair of noise-canceling headphones, we recommend the AirPods Max. The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s surround sound-like Spatial Audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching select content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list while boasting incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that takes opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqkx5j"&gt;At $549, these headphones are expensive, but we’ve been seeing a lot of discounts lately. Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the AirPods Max for $479&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $50 shy of their best price to date and their standard sale price. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3FNtt%3Dairpods%2520max%26N%3D0%26InitialSearch%3Dyes%26sts%3Dma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; is offering the same discount but only on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610234-REG%2Fapple_mgyj3am_a_airpods_max_silver.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610237-REG%2Fapple_mgym3am_a_airpods_max_pink.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22865895%2Fnoise-canceling-headphone-deals-sony-apple-bose-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt; models.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-generation Sennheiser Momentum Wireless headphones sound great and integrate with Tile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CZefdO"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j2k0rf"&gt;If you’re a non-Apple user looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones that sound fantastic, Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless 3 is your best option. We found that they boast detailed, bass-rich sound, a stylish, retro-inspired design, and are extremely comfortable to wear — even when you’re donning glasses. Although their noise cancellation might not rival other models on our list, they make up for it with convenient software features like ambient passthrough and a customizable EQ. Plus, unlike many other headphones, they integrate with the location tracking device, Tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TshVIF"&gt;The headphones typically retail for $399.99, but several retailers have been selling them for $241 since Black Friday. Right now, however, only &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107512/1036?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fse508234.html"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; has them for $241 (and only in black). That’s nearly half their usual price, saving you $159. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 are great for multitasking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HLSET"&gt;Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wB7ybM"&gt;Multitaskers will appreciate Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2 as they offer terrific, reliable multipoint Bluetooth support. You can seamlessly pair them with multiple devices, allowing you to juggle content and switch back and forth at the same time. These headphones also offer intuitive dial controls for volume and noise cancellation, with far better quality and battery life than their predecessor. While the noise canceling isn’t quite as effective as Bose’s and Sony’s, they still adequately silence outside noises so you can focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slxuWB"&gt;During Black Friday, Microsoft’s $249.99 Surface Headphones 2 dropped down to $162.49, which is almost half their typical retail price. We’re not currently seeing any similar big deals on them, but you can still a pair for $230.99 from &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-headphones-2%2F8WQ0BSX7G523%2FCS2R%3FOCID%3D%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619711/9383?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphones142022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Headphones-2-Black-Wireless%2F226974951&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Matte/dp/B086QCFRQ5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt; Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 boast excellent voice quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hB20N"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl2BaG"&gt;If you plan to frequently use your headphones for voice calls, Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are the best option on this list for doing so. They boast excellent voice call quality, meaning everybody on your Zoom call will be able to hear you loud and clearly, and they offer great noise cancellation with satisfactory sound. Like the QC45, the over-ears can also connect to two devices simultaneously, but they can’t be folded and only offer 20 hours of battery life, which is also less than other headphones on this list provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FueOFu"&gt;We’ve seen several discounts on the 700s over the past year or so, with the best reaching an all-time low of $299. Lately, however, we haven’t seen any sales that steep. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X5F81JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has been selling them for $379&lt;/a&gt; instead of $399 for the past six months, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-11556694?sid=TheVergeNCHeadphoneDeals142022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fnoise_cancelling_headphones%2Fnoise-cancelling-headphones-700.html%23v%3Dnoise_cancelling_headphones_700_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoJJjLU8c0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are currently selling the headphones for the same price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Studio 3 are nearly half off and thus a good alternative if you’re looking for a more budget-friendly pair of headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eO1gZ8"&gt;Beats Studio 3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4X0vv8"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; these to anybody outside of the Apple ecosystem, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless could be a decent alternative if you want a pair of over-ear headphones from Apple but find the AirPods Max to be too expensive. The Beats Studio 3 are comfortable to wear, fold inward for easy stowing, and feature Apple’s last-gen W1 wireless chip, which allows you to quickly connect and switch between Apple devices. Note, however, unlike those built with Apple’s newer H1 chip, the headphones lack hands-free Siri support. They also charge via a Micro USB port instead of a Lightning port or USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJn2Mp"&gt;They’re certainly showing their age at this point — they launched 2017, after all — but they're currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Headphones-Collection/dp/B08528ZCNX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale starting at $199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in select colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like newer Bose models, the QuietComfort 35 II are both comfortable and lightweight. They also come with a number of praiseworthy features, including good sound quality and the ability to seamlessly switch between two paired devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lint85"&gt;While their sticker price is $349, the QC35 II are frequently on sale for far less. In fact, until just recently, we saw them for as low as $179. Right now, however, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1227753/2092?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals122021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is only selling the headphones for around $299, about $30 less than Bose QC45 are currently selling for.&lt;/p&gt;

While its sticker price was $299.95, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgp7ZJWzFZK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling them in blue and red for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;.

As a result, Apple no longer sells them, and the retailers that do — like Best Buy — are not likely to continue stocking them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams’ Walkie Talkie feature is now widely available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jsii-FMFc6ChuyogSxMzAQ776hA=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378355/microsoftteamswalkietalkie.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="emp3I5"&gt;Microsoft is making its &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie"&gt;Walkie Talkie feature&lt;/a&gt; of Microsoft Teams generally available to all users of its communications app today. Walkie Talkie lets Microsoft Teams users turn smartphones or tablets into a walkie-talkie that works over cellular data or Wi-FI. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058313/microsoft-teams-walkie-talkie-push-to-talk-feature-preview"&gt;originally announced two years ago&lt;/a&gt; and has been available mostly in preview ever since. The feature &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-september-2020/ba-p/1726562"&gt;launched widely on Android in September of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but now Microsoft says it’s available for Zebra mobile devices as well as iPhones and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeAw8t"&gt;Microsoft has primarily pitched this at frontline workers, employees who are customer-facing and run day-to-day operations inside companies. The software maker’s collaboration with Zebra Technologies makes it work with a dedicated push-to-talk button for quick and secure communications. These devices are used widely by frontline workers, the employees that have helped steer the world through the ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walkie Talkie on Zebra devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kjEEza"&gt;Walkie-talkie features are still rare in communications apps. WhatsApp lets you record snippets of audio than can be sent and received, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556992/slack-huddles-audio-calls-feature-launch-discord-like"&gt;Slack launched its Discord-like Huddles feature&lt;/a&gt; last year to let people drop in and out of calls easily. Apple did launch its own walkie-talkie feature on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17428180/walkie-talkie-apple-watch-facetime-audio-wwdc-2028"&gt;Apple Watch in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, using push-to-talk over a FaceTime Audio call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9n7Tl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 14th, 6:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said the walkie-talkie feature has been in preview ever since it was announced. In fact, it launched in general availability on Android devices in late 2020. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is now requiring office workers to get weekly molecular COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyWQBJCwG4iGzjSgzgi8-WQtClU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392343/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company is implementing new policies as COVID-19 cases rise across the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cVBhzE"&gt;Google will require anyone going to one of its US offices or facilities to have received a negative molecular test for COVID-19, the company informed employees Thursday in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/google-tells-anyone-coming-into-the-office-to-take-weekly-covid-tests.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;memo obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Workers going to the office regularly will have to get tested weekly, chief health officer Karen DeSalvo said in the memo, and employees have been asked to report their vaccination status&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and wear surgical-grade masks indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IxE4l"&gt;Google spokesperson Lora Lee Erickson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a new temporary COVID-19 policy is now being implemented, one where “anyone accessing our sites in the US are expected to obtain a recent negative COVID-19 molecular test before coming onsite” and that it’s offering various kinds of tests at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kHOOB4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google offers at-home tests for employees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBQlrt"&gt;Google offers free at-home testing to full-time employees and contract workers through BioIQ’s PCR-based nasal swab tests, Erickson said, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/google-staff-get-pricey-fast-covid-tests-while-contractors-wait"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that full-time employees also have access to molecular tests from Cue Health that can give results in just a few minutes. Contractors, on the other hand, are specifically being offered the mail-in BioIQ tests, according to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1480987095174766593"&gt;tweet from the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt;, which means they must wait longer for a result. Erickson tells us that some Google contractors at the company’s datacenters have access to rapid on-site testing using the Cue machines, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9BrsM"&gt;The changes arrive as COVID-19 cases have surged across the country and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/who-says-omicron-cases-are-off-the-charts-as-global-infections-set-new-records.html"&gt;as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/a&gt;. These new policies add to Google’s directive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;from December&lt;/a&gt; requiring employees to get vaccinated or risk being forced to take leave and eventually be fired. The company delayed its mandatory return to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;to some point this year&lt;/a&gt; in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qi4zls"&gt;This week, Meta also upped its health policies for employees, requiring anyone returning to its offices when they open at the end of March to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;received a booster dose of a vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s AI-powered scaling makes old games look better without a huge performance hit  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fYS1HiDS4A-eWoRyW7yqN3VweA=/282x0:3332x2033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392269/nvidia_dldsr_ai_deep_learning_dynamic_super_resolution_performance_image_quality_comparison.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia says its AI-powered upscaling is more powerful than regular super-resolution.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XS1j6s"&gt;Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgod-of-war-game-ready-driver%2F%3FlinkId%3D100000103579293&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest game-ready driver&lt;/a&gt; includes a tool that could let you improve the image quality of games that your graphics card can easily run, alongside optimizations for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22883541/god-of-war-pc-port-interview"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; PC port&lt;/a&gt;. The tech is called Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution, or DLDSR, and Nvidia says you can use it to make “most games” look sharper by running them at a higher resolution than your monitor natively supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFBHbr"&gt;DLDSR builds on Nvidia’s Dynamic Super Resolution tech, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6502823/nvidia-and-amd-bring-out-their-big-new-guns-for-the-holidays"&gt;been around for years&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fdsr%2Ftechnology%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regular old DSR&lt;/a&gt; renders a game at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle and then downscales it to your monitor’s native resolution. This leads to an image with better sharpness but usually comes with a dip in performance (you are asking your GPU to do more work, after all). So, for instance, if you had a graphics card capable of running a game at 4K but only had a 1440p monitor, you could use DSR to get a boost in clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Jyhly"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DLDSR takes DSR and adds AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sYMBBU"&gt;DLDSR takes the same concept and incorporates AI that can also work to enhance the image. According to Nvidia, this means you can upscale less (and therefore lose less performance) while still getting similar image quality improvements. In real numbers, Nvidia claims you’ll get image quality similar to running at four times the resolution using DSR with only 2.25 times the resolution with DLDSR. Nvidia gives an example using 2017’s &lt;em&gt;Prey: Digital Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;running on a 1080p monitor:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;4x&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;DSR runs at 108 FPS, while 2.25x DLDSR is getting 143 FPS, only two frames per second slower than running at native 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c74poS"&gt;Of course, you may want to take those impressive results with a grain of salt, as Nvidia’s obviously going to want to show one of the best-case examples. In the real world, you may get different results with different games, both in terms of FPS and what settings you have to run DLDSR in to get it looking crisp. Given its wider game support, though, you’ll probably be able to play around with it using one of your favorite older titles  — though you still will need an RTX card, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;aren’t exactly easy to get right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TMRAju"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia has had a lot of success with deep learning lately&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDRFfH"&gt;This isn’t the first time Nvidia’s used deep learning to improve image quality and performance — it’s gotten a lot of praise for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics"&gt;its Deep Learning Super Sampling&lt;/a&gt;, or DLSS, system. However, DLSS needs to be specifically supported by the game, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fdlss%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;list of games you can use it with&lt;/a&gt; is relatively small (though, as of today, it includes the &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpq6KD"&gt;AMD, Nvidia’s graphics card competitor, has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866673/amd-radeon-super-resolution-software-ai-super-sampling-ces-2022"&gt;announced tech to improve performance and graphics&lt;/a&gt; on a wide array of games. It calls its approach Radeon Super Resolution, and while it doesn’t use exactly the same methods as DLSS or DLDSR (AMD has its own upscaling tech called &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/vsr"&gt;virtual super resolution&lt;/a&gt;), it’s aiming towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGvsGT"&gt;If you want to try out Nvidia’s DLDSR, update to the latest driver, then open up Nvidia Control Panel app. Go to Manage 3D Settings, click the DSR - Factors drop-down, and select one of the DL Scaling options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s critical Pixel 6 January update is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-kvqmfhip2vzuFHX3kE0wobOMMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70391322/akrales_211020_4802_0471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The January update promises to fix numerous bugs reported by Pixel 6 owners.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRabhh"&gt;Google is in the process of releasing a much-anticipated update for Pixel 6 phones. Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mishaalrahman/status/1482073557064638467"&gt;Android expert Mishaal Rahman noted&lt;/a&gt; that Google posted &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota"&gt;OTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images"&gt;factory images&lt;/a&gt; to its developer site for the January 2022 patch. That means anyone can sideload the update to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; now, and the official over-the-air update has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1482098746779447305"&gt;already arrived on some devices&lt;/a&gt; (including some owned by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crc7jX"&gt;In an email, Google confirmed the rollout has begun, and that the software will automatically roll out over the next week, depending on your device and wireless carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBcYtF"&gt;Using the phones’ built-in checker may start the process now, and if it doesn’t, &lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/welcome"&gt;sideloading&lt;/a&gt; is still an option. However, waiting for the regular rollout instead of doing a manual install may be the best way to go, given the trouble caused by December’s update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26RgBb"&gt;This patch includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;numerous bug fixes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820593/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-quick-tap-to-snap-shortcut-ultra-wideband-nearby-share"&gt;a few new features&lt;/a&gt; that Pixel 6 owners have been anxiously awaiting. It’s supposed to tweak the fingerprint sensor, camera, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788072/google-pixel-6-stand-wireless-charging-fast-23w-qi"&gt;23W wireless charging with the second-generation Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;. On the Pixel 6 Pro, you can use its ultra-wideband chip for digital car key access to compatible BMWs. This update also adds the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap&lt;/a&gt;” integration that Google and Snapchat touted during the devices’ launch event and new bass controls for the Pixel Buds A-Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXwjy1"&gt;Google originally intended to ship those features in the December update but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;halted and ultimately removed the files&lt;/a&gt; from its site when users complained of connectivity troubles after installing the patch. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that the January update has fixes for those bugs, and includes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/139017133/google-pixel-update-december-2021?hl=en"&gt;the December update’s fixes&lt;/a&gt; to address bugs that have driven &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?s=20"&gt;at least one well-known Pixel 6 user&lt;/a&gt; to ditch the phone entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uUwIo"&gt;With the images public and &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2022/01/14/pixel-6-january-update-release-date/"&gt;one Canadian telecom company&lt;/a&gt; citing Monday, January 17th for the release, we thought the patch would arrive next week, but it’s already here. That’s none too soon for people who bought the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro expecting to get a premium device. While the hardware is truly flagship-level, the software experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22881882/android-12-google-pixel-6-pro-bugs-oneplus-oxygenos-12-samsung-one-ui-4-update"&gt;hasn’t always been smooth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS9v0s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 4:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the update is rolling out now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3HM1V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Google’s confirmation of the update, and that it includes both the December and January changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says COVIDTests website will distribute free rapid tests starting January 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axfACWQk7alU8K1psz5dgmX2Bh4=/58x0:1807x1166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70391114/Screen_Shot_2022_01_14_at_11.41.43.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site is live, but you won’t be able to order tests until Wednesday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sHGd6n"&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1482072719688712204?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that people will be able to order free COVID-19 tests from &lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt; starting on Wednesday, January 19th. This follows a promise that the government would be setting up a website to distribute 500 million tests, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;President Joe Biden announced in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPUV8X"&gt;You’ll only have to put in two pieces of info to get a test shipped to you — your name and address. In its announcement, the White House said the tests will ship through the US Postal Service “within 7–12 days of ordering.” Currently, the limit is &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;four tests per residential address.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SYOBT6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To order their tests, the only two things people will need are their name and residential mailing address. Tests will typically ship through the mail within 7-12 days of ordering, and be delivered First Class through the U.S. Postal Service.&lt;/p&gt;— The White House (@WhiteHouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1482072719688712204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F4idES"&gt;On Wednesday of this week, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880467/white-house-covid-coronavirus-testing-website-order-rapid-tests"&gt;White House advisor said&lt;/a&gt; the site “should be online by this weekend.” Technically, the government has made that deadline — you can visit &lt;a href="https://covidtests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt; right now, though it’s currently showing a landing page letting you know that tests will be available Wednesday and that you won’t have to put in a credit card number to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NC6XBD"&gt;The USPS isn’t just responsible for getting the tests to people. It was also tapped to develop a website that will have to deal with potentially millions of people trying to get a test at the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/white-house-covid-test-website"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report cites a government official who said that it’s “taking our website launch very seriously” and that it “didn’t start from scratch” building the site. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5992087/us-digital-service-created-to-prevent-tech-debacles-like-healthcare-gov"&gt;US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt; will also be helping to launch the site and provide support when needed, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMYH0l"&gt;Given the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/us-world/2013/12/3/5163228/healthcare-gov-obamacare-website-shows-how-government-can-do-tech-better"&gt;less-than-stellar reputation with launching healthcare websites&lt;/a&gt;, there’s some skepticism about whether the site will be able to handle the traffic — and some have rightfully pointed out that some of the most vulnerable people could have difficulties getting online and navigating a website. A &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;statement from the White House&lt;/a&gt; says that you’ll also be able to call a hotline to order tests if you’re unable to access the website and that the government will “work with national and local community-based organizations to support the nation’s hardest-hit and highest-risk communities in requesting tests.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is reportedly investigating Meta’s VR division for antitrust violations</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvSStx"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission and at least three states are investigating Meta for antitrust violations in its virtual reality division, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/meta-s-oculus-unit-faces-ftc-led-probe-of-competition-practices?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report says the FTC and attorneys general from New York, Tennessee, and North Carolina began speaking last year with third-party VR developers who have concerns about Meta’s business practices. It’s one of multiple probes into Meta’s dominance in the small but growing market of VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoFoxu"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report references &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;well-known controversies&lt;/a&gt; around Meta (formerly Facebook) and its VR division (formerly Oculus). Regulators have reportedly asked developers if the Oculus app store discriminates against third-party apps whose features overlap with its own offerings, and they’ve apparently questioned Meta’s strategy of selling the Meta Quest (formerly Oculus Quest) headset at a $299 price point that heavily undercuts the price of other VR headsets. The FTC declined to comment on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwMFXL"&gt;The FTC has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840635/ftc-opens-antitrust-probe-meta-deal-vr-fitness-app-supernatural"&gt;allegedly already opened a probe&lt;/a&gt; into Meta’s acquisition of Within, the company behind VR fitness app Supernatural. The US Justice Department also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/facebook-accused-of-squeezing-rival-startups-in-virtual-reality"&gt;reportedly investigated similar claims&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020. German regulators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167509/germany-fco-investigation-facebook-oculus-account-requirements-competition"&gt;publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; an investigation around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6QjAJ"&gt;So far, VR has still gotten little attention compared to other Meta divisions. The FTC is currently pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the company over its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp; after a setback last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878808/ftc-meta-facebook-lawsuit-ruling-revised-complaint-discovery"&gt;a judge revived the suit&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. But as Meta has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;begun emphasizing its role&lt;/a&gt; as a steward of a VR-heavy “metaverse,” the area may invite more legal scrutiny as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix raises prices on all plans in US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nyxncmndfLi0VleZNgfm9mp1WXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70390996/acastro_211025_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C16tBa"&gt;Netflix is &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926"&gt;raising prices across all of its plans in the US&lt;/a&gt; today. The company’s standard plan will rise to $15.50 per month from $14, while the 4K plan will rise to $20 per month from $18. The basic plan, which doesn’t include HD, is also rising to $10 per month from $9. Prices are rising in Canada as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wQhb"&gt;The price hikes go into effect immediately for new subscribers. For existing subscribers, the changes will be rolled out “gradually,” with Netflix promising to email members 30 days before the price hike goes into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SC4OM0"&gt;Prices for a Netflix plan have steadily gone up in recent years. The standard plan went to $14 per month from $13 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;late 2020&lt;/a&gt;, after previously rising to $13 from from $11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183602/netflix-subscription-price-raise-us-streaming-plans"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to that, Netflix raised prices in 2017 and 2015. When Netflix announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5698782/netflix-streaming-price-increases"&gt;its first wide-scale price increase in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, the company was so worried about losing subscribers over a $1 per month bump that it let existing members keep their price for two years. It hasn’t offered such a generous perk in the years since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E5t1o2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10978542"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sMK9f"&gt;The price hikes come during a successful but challenging moment for Netflix. The company already has a wealth of subscribers across the US, and adding more is a challenge — making price hikes an obvious answer for how it can make more money. At the same time, Netflix is now competing with several other serious streaming services for attention, including Disney Plus and HBO Max, and it’s been spending big on content to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6t0E6"&gt;“We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options,” a Netflix spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-netflix-raises-monthly-subscription-prices-us-canada-2022-01-14/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “As always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0rSMN"&gt;Netflix isn’t the only service that’s been raising prices lately. Hulu &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney"&gt;hiked the price&lt;/a&gt; of its ad-supported and ad-free tiers by $1 per month in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmzEd8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QMqIk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
