    <title>The HP Chromebook 14 is just over $230 at Amazon right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DBVyRuOgdDLIiKTdZzHxRnlHSHk=/0x250:1500x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69861003/HP_Chromebook_13_FHD_Laptop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 32GB HP Chromebook 14 is no powerhouse, but it can nail the basics without breaking the bank.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="putUsp"&gt;The perfect laptop for the college-bound, this versatile 14-inch Chromebook from HP is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Chromebook-Processor-Lightweight-14a-na0021nr/dp/B08YKGZF7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for just $236&lt;/a&gt;, one of its better prices to date. This device packs a remarkable amount of versatility into a compact and lightweight package. At less than an inch thick and weighing in at less than 3.5 pounds, it's easy to tote around, without it turning into a third wheel. While the 13-hour battery may not provide all-day power, it's more than enough to ensure that it won’t die on you during a crucial lecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LOm6q"&gt;The 32GB of onboard storage provides ample room to back up your documents, too, and the pair of USB-C and single USB-A ports can accommodate a variety of storage options. Equipped with a built-in wide-angle webcam and mic, this Chromebook will help you stay connected wherever your learning takes you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jVg7tX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Chromebooks of 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="XfYegt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752610"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3YPEd"&gt;For anyone looking to catch up on the rest of the Arkane catalog before diving into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can currently grab &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Arkane Collection&lt;/em&gt; for Xbox One for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dishonored-Prey-Arkane-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B08L6CBHC3?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $16 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. While this is a physical copy — and for last-gen consoles no less — it's tough to turn down a value this good, especially when it includes so many great titles. The noteworthy collection brings together &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dishonored 2&lt;/em&gt;, as well as &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt; and all of its associated DLC. This bundle is the perfect way to fill in some glaring gaps in your gaming library and bide your time in the hopes that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; comes to Microsoft consoles following Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;one-year, timed exclusivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jCsbIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752730"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SLreRC"&gt;If you’re been struggling with your current mouse and are looking to up your game, look no further than the Logitech G903 Lightspeed. Normally $150, right now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Rechargeable-Compatible-Ambidextrous/dp/B07NSVMT22?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $50&lt;/a&gt; on this customizable gaming mouse, which comes packaged with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a bleeding-edge gaming mouse, including RGB lighting. Under the hood, this latest iteration of the G903 comes equipped with a 25K DPI sensor, offering great maneuverability, especially when paired with its 1ms response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5vcye"&gt;The G903 has a whopping 11 customizable buttons, too, and the swappable side buttons make its design ambidextrous, rendering the mouse one of the few that is suitable for southpaws. This mouse is also wireless, and while its 140-hour battery life gives it substantial staying power, the G903 is also compatible with Logitech’s Powerplay wireless charging mousepad, allowing it to operate indefinitely. The only real drawback to this otherwise phenomenal mouse is its weight; it comes in at around 107 grams, making it a little heavy when stacked against its contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Nvy9iG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Y5VFoa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752982"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ntYoqi"&gt;Any fan of PC gaming will tell you how quickly their storage space seems to disappear with the rapidly inflating size of modern games. Supplementing your storage with an SSD, however, is a great way to get ahead of the game. This 500GB WD_Black SSD is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099GC4CRK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $90 ($25 off)&lt;/a&gt; and, as an added bonus, it includes a download code for the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkZXgy"&gt;The SN750 SE SSD from Western Digital is a PCIe Gen 4 drive that boasts read speeds of 3,600MB/s which helps to speed up load times and file transfers. This is compatible with PCs, of course, but it should work in the PlayStation 5, too, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;received an update&lt;/a&gt; that allows additions to its hidden M.2 SSD slot. This drive isn’t as fast as some other PCIe Gen 4 SSDs — like Samsung’s 980 Pro that can reach max read speeds of 7,000MB/s — but in our testing during the PS5’s software beta, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;we didn’t notice much of a difference in performance between slower and faster drives&lt;/a&gt; (that’s not to say it won’t become more apparent in the future). Also, Sony recommends using a heatsink, which this one doesn’t come with, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzuSYf"&gt;While this isn’t a preorder, it's important to note that these SSDs aren’t slated to ship until early October, and the PC download code won’t work until &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; launches on October 22nd. That said, you’ll need to act now to take advantage of this promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is expanding its Spanish-language programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UujR6SsbJdjXC48BURmQXV37uk8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860874/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KSELjq"&gt;YouTube TV is expanding its live TV channels to include more Spanish-language content and add-on options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olKgVY"&gt;The company announced that beginning today, three new Spanish-language networks — Univision, UniMás, and Galavisión — would be joining the YouTube TV experience at no additional cost to subscribers. Notably, the new networks will include coverage of two events that are just around the corner: the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards premiering on November 18th and the Campeones Cup airing on September 29th. This week’s announcement corresponds with the start of Hispanic Heritage Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I8hZJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CNN Español, Fox Deportes, and more will be offered as a paid add-on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1U0tlf"&gt;Local programming from Univision and UniMás will also be available to subscribers in select markets, including Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, among other cities. Univision’s addition to the platform, meanwhile, will also give YouTube TV users access to the company’s on-demand content as well as the ability to log into the Univision app using their YouTube TV information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gM7Mgk"&gt;Univision networks aren’t widely available on streaming TV services — they’re missing from Hulu and Sling, for instance — which could give YouTube an edge as it looks to pick up new customers. (Univision has its own streaming goals: it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544041/univision-streaming-service-announcement-free-premium"&gt;launch a new streaming service&lt;/a&gt; next year with ad-supported and paid plans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2NkYS"&gt;For viewers looking to unlock more Spanish-language programming beyond the new networks, YouTube will also offer a new add-on option that includes networks like Sony Cine, CNN Español, Discovery en Español, Estrella TV, Cinelatino, and Fox Deportes, among others. YouTube said this add-on will be made available in the “coming months,” and the package’s cost and a full slate of included networks will be announced a little closer to its launch date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mz9kzJ"&gt;Lastly, the company will soon introduce a separate add-on for Pantaya, an on-demand streaming service for Spanish-language movies, for $6 a month. That add-on will become available to YouTube TV users in the coming weeks. YouTube TV, which offers over 85 channels, currently costs $65 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft accounts can now go fully passwordless</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCEOoLR9sVNfDobZ7nswTLRikMw=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860887/microsoftauthenticator.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You no longer need a password for a Microsoft account&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WI92GQ"&gt;Microsoft now lets you remove passwords from Microsoft accounts to embrace a passwordless future. Starting today, the software giant will let consumers sign into Microsoft accounts with its Microsoft Authenticator app, Windows Hello, a security key, or an SMS / email verification code instead of a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSb5ec"&gt;The new option arrives just months after Microsoft started rolling out passwordless authentication for commercial users in March to help people adjust to the realities of remote work. “When I think of security, I think you’ve got to protect your whole life,” says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft security, compliance &amp;amp; identity, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s no longer enough just to think about work or home and anything in between.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icYRpq"&gt;Microsoft has been working toward a passwordless future for years, and the pandemic has only accelerated things. “When you have digital transformation and businesses having to go remote overnight … the number of digital surfaces has increased exponentially,” explains Jakkal. “The number of attack surfaces has increased exponentially, so that was a big driving factor for us in accelerating a lot of our security initiatives.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3TsOM7PYBYbLRap_kcViSBWEN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852143/NQnilt7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft will let you fully remove a password from your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R9y0HD"&gt;Today is a major milestone for Microsoft’s passwordless ambitions, after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104376/microsoft-account-no-password-windows-hello-fido2-support"&gt;enabled security keys in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690359/microsoft-windows-10-passwordless-password-option-update"&gt;Windows 10 passwordless&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. “We have been rolling this out at Microsoft and nearly 100 percent of Microsoft is now passwordless,” says Jakkal. More than 200 million commercial customers are already using the passwordless option, and Jakkal is optimistic about the adoption among consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knzTnx"&gt;It’s a relatively simple process to remove your password, too. You’ll need to have the Microsoft Authenticator mobile app installed and linked to your personal Microsoft Account. Once that’s complete, you can visit &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F15%2F22675175%2Fmicrosoft-account-passwordless-no-password-security-feature" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;account.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt; and choose advanced security options and then enable passwordless accounts in the additional security section. You then approve the change from your Authenticator app and you’ll be password free. You can always reverse the change and add a password back to your Microsoft account in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZepzBs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You can now sign into a Microsoft Account without a password ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15345300/microsoft-account-no-password-authenticator-app-feature"},{"title":"You can now sign into a Microsoft Account without a password using a security key ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104376/microsoft-account-no-password-windows-hello-fido2-support"},{"title":"Microsoft’s new password manager works across Edge, Chrome, and mobile devices ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WSKL5N"&gt;The benefits of passwordless authentication are very clear. Most people create their own passwords, and it’s often a challenge to create something that’s secure and memorable without relying on a password manager. People often reuse their passwords, too, allowing attackers to quickly log into a variety of compromised accounts after a particular organization is targeted and passwords are dumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClWke1"&gt;Google, Apple, and others are also working toward less reliance on passwords. Google Chrome &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17409480/google-chrome-sign-in-without-password"&gt;lets you sign in without a password&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s iOS 15 and macOS Monterey updates include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529266/passkeys-icloud-keychain-ios-15-passwordless-future-security-login"&gt;Passkeys in iCloud Keychain feature&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to replace passwords with a more secure login process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi returns to Android tablets with the 11-inch Pad 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFCX15sCxdnvhxYg5CWMSNlisOk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860878/DSCF7769.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rrYNo5"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its first tablet in a few years, the Xiaomi Pad 5. (The last one was 2018’s 8-inch Mi Pad 4; Xiaomi recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639020/xiaomi-mi-brand-ending-mix-4-confirmed"&gt;phased out&lt;/a&gt; its Mi product branding.) It’s launching in the company’s European markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5d9y3k"&gt;The Xiaomi Pad 5 is an 11-inch tablet with a WQHD+ 120Hz display, quad speakers, 6GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon 860 processor — that’s the new speed-bumped version of the 855, Qualcomm’s flagship chip from 2019. Round the back there’s a 13-megapixel camera, and there’s a 8-megapixel sensor on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHKx4k"&gt;The Pad 5 pretty inescapably looks like an iPad Pro, from the slim bezels and flat edges to the tablet-specific MIUI customizations like the apps dock. The build isn’t as solid, and the screen doesn’t quite sit as flush with the chassis, but the inspiration is clear. The screen and speaker quality are both very good, though, and performance has been smooth — I’ve found it to be a more than competent device for tablety things like watching video and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-wNu9rFK0N2IwjZXSC4yiyqUmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852152/DSCF7768.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9FRDHN"&gt;I’m less clear on how well it’ll work for productivity. Xiaomi product marketing head Abi Go tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company thinks of the Pad 5 as a “portable workstation” as well as an entertainment device, and there’ll be stylus and keyboard accessories in some markets. I haven’t been able to test those, though, and the track record of Android tablets in this arena is not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oolaqd"&gt;Still, it’s rare enough to see a good Android tablet at all these days, even if you’re just looking for a consumption device, and the Xiaomi Pad 5 compares quite favorably to Apple’s iPad lineup on price. It’ll cost €349 (~$413) for a 128GB version, or €399 ($472) for 256GB. The iPad Air is its most similar rival, and that starts at €679 ($803) for 64GB in Europe — though of course, it has the not inconsiderable advantage of being an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJYM3q"&gt;Xiaomi hasn’t given a specific release date for the Pad 5, only saying that it’ll vary by region.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces 11T Pro with 120W fast charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhAPOCZbLCfCVQXtrGr5lsi7aIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860918/DSCF7771.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uoaOXZ"&gt;Xiaomi has launched its 11T series, the headline of which is the 11T Pro and its previously announced 120W HyperCharge fast charging system. The phone has a 5,000mAh battery, and Xiaomi says the bundled 120W charger can fill it from zero to 100 percent in just 17 minutes. A 10-minute charge will get you to 72 percent, meanwhile. That’s even faster than the 120W Mi 10 Ultra Xiaomi released in China last year, and the 11T Pro is coming to Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EtPTw"&gt;For more on the 11T Pro’s fast charging technology — like whether it’ll destroy the battery or burn down your house, for instance — you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666347/xiaomi-11t-pro-120w-fast-charging-battery-interview"&gt;interview with Xiaomi’s Dan Desjarlais&lt;/a&gt; from last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IESXpq"&gt;The 11T Pro is an entirely different phone to the Mi 11 flagship released earlier this year. It has a different, boxier design with a plastic back, though the specs are similar — there’s still a Snapdragon 888 processor and a 108-megapixel camera. The screen is a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p OLED panel with no curves on the side, unlike the Mi 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSGeaQL2KwfDf7LrbYZOJoeKDTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852257/DSCF7772.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iUgnmF"&gt;Xiaomi is also announcing two lower-end phones in the 11T range, neither of which have the 120W fast charging system. The 11T has a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-Ultra processor and 67W fast charging that fills the battery in 37 minutes, while the 11 Lite 5G NE has a Snapdragon 778 and a 4,250mAh battery that Xiaomi says fills in “no time,” which may not be a scientific measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stIIW8"&gt;The Xiaomi 11T Pro starts at €649 ($768) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, going up to €749 ($886) for 12GB/256GB. The 11T starts at €499 ($590) for 8GB/128GB or €50 more to double the storage, while the 11 Lite 5G NE starts at €369 ($437) for 6GB/128GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is rolling out a new ‘5G UC’ icon for iPhones to tell when you have real 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/trrIzyhQcMhRtojb8X5MdWnBIQo=/0x19:934x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860859/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_8.24.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qe3Npq"&gt;5G branding is going to get even more confusing, soon: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481"&gt;T-Mobile has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be rolling out a new “5G UC” icon on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;upcoming iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; lineup to let customers know when they’re connected to T-Mobile’s “5G Ultra Capacity” network, instead of the regular old 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qF9MYF"&gt;The difference here is one of bands and brands: at T-Mobile, an unadorned “5G” icon will soon refer to the company’s low-band network, which it calls “5G Extended Range.” As the name suggests, it’s a slower network (closer to legacy LTE speeds) but it reaches a broader area. From a spectrum perspective, it exists in largely the same areas as LTE but uses 5G technologies and techniques for improved speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gO6qtH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mnPKuN"&gt;A “5G UC” icon, though, will mean that you’re either connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile’s mid-band network&lt;/a&gt; (which it inherited from Sprint as part of the major merger between the two companies) or its high-band mmWave network (branded as “5G Ultra Capacity”) — both of which offer dramatically faster speeds. As &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 5G speed test&lt;/a&gt; showed this year, that mid-band coverage in particular (hitting the sweet spot of speed increase and range) has been a big contributor toward T-Mobile’s vastly improved network offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58JHWy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13Pro&lt;/a&gt; will let &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobile&lt;/a&gt; customers know when they are in an area with⚡️  fast speeds with Ultra Capacity 5G!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just keep an eye out for the below icon.   users will see it more and more as we continue to rapidly roll out this   spectrum combo. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EirfCk8pjl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EirfCk8pjl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neville (@NevilleRay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p4LJqy"&gt;And while yet another 5G brand standard is confusing, it’s not without precedent. Verizon has been differentiating between its low-band 5G (also called “5G”) and its mmWave coverage (“5G UW,” or ultra-wideband) since it started rolling out those networks years ago. AT&amp;amp;T does something similar, too, referring to low-band 5G as “5G,” while its mmWave networks are “5G Plus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240QJO"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also has the unfortunate tendency to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;misleadingly refer to its LTE networks as “5G E,”&lt;/a&gt; which, unlike the other flavors of 5G on this list, is not actually 5G at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj1rXT"&gt;But T-Mobile’s change is arguably a necessary one: the rush to sell customers on 5G and slap the next-generation networking’s branding everywhere has meant that the low-band networks most people currently experience as “5G” is actually fairly similar — practically speaking — to LTE. But now that carriers are actually rolling out the bigger improvements that do bring meaningful speed and latency increases, they’re caught in a problem of their own devising: regular “5G” is too diluted of a brand to make an impact, hence the more bombastic ultras and pluses being appended to icons and logos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39Qhap"&gt;The new 5G UC icons should start rolling out soon on the iPhone 13 models once they’re released, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/po9aqn/tmobile_to_add_5g_uc_icon_to_iphone_13_when_in/hcvei91/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;last year’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t count on resurrected woolly mammoths to combat climate change </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Co-founders of Colossal, Ben Lamm (L), CEO and Dr. George Church (R), PhD&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gtiY-rKHjRtyGbfHxx8Xznuw_4k=/351x0:3194x1895/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860830/ben_george.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Co-founders of Colossal, Ben Lamm (L), CEO and George Church (R) | Image: Business Wire&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlhoVw"&gt;A flashy new biotech startup &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210913005498/en/Woolly-Mammoths-Will-Walk-the-Arctic-Tundra-Again-New-Biosciences-and-Genetics-Company-Colossal-Pioneers-Animal-De-Extinction-Technology-to-Help-Restore-Lost-Ecosystems-and-Help-Ensure-a-Habitable-Planet"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; yesterday called Colossal is on a mission to make an elephant-woolly mammoth mashup — with the ultimate goal of promoting biodiversity and combating climate change, it says. The effort has gotten a lot of hype and big-name backers, but scientists who work in conservation are still pretty skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4ex5Sw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The science behind Colossal is in very early stages and is mired in ethical quandaries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdiwHx"&gt;The science behind Colossal is in very early stages and is mired in ethical quandaries. The company won’t actually bring back a woolly mammoth, which hasn’t roamed the Earth in about 10,000 years. Instead, Colossal’s de-extinction effort aims to create a hybrid between a woolly mammoth and its distant relative (the two share a common ancestor): the Asian elephant, which itself is an endangered species. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7UMzx"&gt;Mammoths are a poor choice for de-extinction — a field of research that has picked up steam in recent years — and this project might steal the spotlight from more important conservation efforts, ecologists and biologists tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The woolly mammoth’s pseudo-resurrection is also a risky proposal as a fix for climate change, experts say, given the short timeline humanity has to slash greenhouse gas emissions that have given Earth a fever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyNclV"&gt;“I guess I confess, the five-year-old in me would just love to see a mammoth,” says Joseph Bennett, an assistant professor at the Institute of Environmental Science and Department of Biology at Carleton University. “It’s just fascinating from a scientific standpoint. But if it’s called conservation, and if it’s called fighting climate change, that’s when the problems arise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hJZtQj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How de-extinction might work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PIUoj2"&gt;Imagine a furrier, fatter elephant with smaller ears and a high-domed head. That’s what Colossal might one day create using CRISPR technology to edit the DNA of an Asian elephant to introduce traits from woolly mammoths. Over the next four years or so, the aim is to produce embryos with those traits by building off the work of Harvard geneticist George Church, a co-founder of the company. To create the embryo, they might harvest eggs from an elephant or try to create stem cells using elephant tissue. Colossal also wants to create an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/science/colossal-woolly-mammoth-DNA.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;artificial uterus&lt;/a&gt; to carry the embryo, which would take about two years to develop into a 200-pound fetus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="v3BEGh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine a furrier, fatter elephant with smaller ears and a high-domed head&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WCyQz"&gt;Church and his team of researchers have been working toward that goal for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4119062/can-deextinction-bring-back-the-mammoth-passenger-pigeon-thylacine"&gt;about a decade&lt;/a&gt;, and said &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/wooly-mammoth-will-not-be-resurrected-in-two-years/"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that it was just a couple of years away from creating the embryo. But Church’s team, until now, has lacked the funding to make that happen, according to Colossal co-founder and CEO and tech entrepreneur Ben Lamm. Colossal’s investors, which include private equity firms and self-help guru Tony Robbins, will infuse the project with $15 million. That builds on a previous $100,000 contribution from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that Church’s team received before Colossal was founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3WULY"&gt;If all that funding ultimately results in a real-life Asian elephant-mammoth hybrid, there will still be a lot of ecological and ethical questions with which to grapple. Colossal bills itself as an effort to tackle biodiversity loss. Earth is probably losing a species or more a day, according to Bennett. There is evidence of a &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-mass-extinction-and-are-we-facing-a-sixth-one.html"&gt;mass extinction&lt;/a&gt; taking place, the likes of which hasn’t been seen on Earth for millions of years. When it comes to protecting biodiversity on our planet, resurrecting a prehistoric creature is low on the priority list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9Z815"&gt;“Even within endangered species that we want to keep from going extinct, we have to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22584103/biodiversity-species-conservation-debate"&gt;prioritize&lt;/a&gt; what are the winners and the losers,” says Ginger Allington, a landscape ecologist and assistant professor at George Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f6nUn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Even within endangered species that we want to keep from going extinct, we have to &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.vox.com/22584103/biodiversity-species-conservation-debate" target="_blank"&gt;prioritize&lt;/a&gt; what are the winners and the losers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QV7ZYO"&gt;Funding de-extinction could hurt other conservation efforts by siphoning off limited resources, Bennett’s previous &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/news/2017/02/bringing-extinct-species-back-dead-could-hurt-not-help-conservation-efforts"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found. Spending the same amount of money on traditional conservation efforts could save up to eight times more species than if the money was to be spent on de-extinction. The Asian elephant itself could use help; its numbers have &lt;a href="https://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/Asian%20Elephant%20Red%20List%20Assessment%202020.pdf"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; in half over the past three generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iENag5"&gt;Lamm believes Colossal’s work might benefit the elephants and draw more attention to other conservation efforts. “We’re trying to make sure that we do this in the most transparent and ethical way as possible,” Lamm tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We feel very confident about what we can do to help the elephant lineage … For us it’s about giving the species additional tools to survive.” An elephant with mammoth traits would be better able to survive in the Arctic’s cold temperatures, away from urbanization that threatens its species, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgJXLp"&gt;But Asian elephants’ home is tropical South and Southeast Asia. They’re also highly intelligent and social animals that form tight-knit groups. “They have a culture,” Bennett says. All that raises “major” ethical questions for Bennett over whether a mammoth-elephant hybrid would be able to behaviorally manage being transplanted in a new home that’s vastly different from where elephant species currently live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="m9F2rh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feat of mammoth proportions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YtEjT0"&gt;Even a full-fledged woolly mammoth might struggle to adapt to the Arctic as it is today. “If you were to take a piece from a whole system like a Model T, say a piston, and you were to wait even 100 years and then try to integrate that into a Tesla — that won’t fit because the rest of the system has completely moved on and changed dramatically,” says Douglas McCauley, an ecologist and associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5cwqr"&gt;Colossal thinks the animals could essentially re-engineer ecosystems, turning mossy tundra back to grasslands that once thrived with mammoths’ help 10,000 years ago. Without mammoths, grasslands where they roamed were slowly replaced by moss and trees. That poses problems for the planet because snow-covered grasslands in the Arctic are better at reflecting radiation from the sun than darker shrublands or woodlands. Bringing herds back could theoretically reverse that trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e05h77"&gt;The hybrid animals might also help prevent permafrost (soil that’s frozen year-round) from melting, which releases old stores of planet-heating carbon dioxide. A father-son pair of ecologists in Russia have tried using bison, reindeer, and other animals to achieve something similar in Siberia in a place called “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/pleistocene-park/517779/"&gt;Pleistocene Park&lt;/a&gt;.” The hope is that the animals — perhaps one day with the help of elephant-mammoth hybrids — will trample down snow and make it easier for the soil so to freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jh5vAX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The animal could become a sort of “eco-zombie” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9MCZFV"&gt;But for Colossal to be able to fulfill its goals, it would need to ensure that there are enough of the animals to do the job that mammoths once did. Otherwise, the animal could become a sort of “eco-zombie” that doesn’t meaningfully participate in its ecosystem as it once did, as McCauley and other authors describe in their 2017 &lt;a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.12728"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; about how to prioritize species for de-extinction efforts. Choosing animals that have recently gone extinct, or are on the verge of extinction, are better candidates, that paper said. They should also be species that perform a unique function or job in its ecosystem, and that can bounce back to big enough numbers to be able to effectively do that job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVG7Sk"&gt;One promising route for de-extinction research is research into breeding coral that are more resilient to a warming world — potentially saving them from extinction. It’s an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03629-7#ref-CR1"&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; that could support fisheries and shield coastal communities around the world from storm surge. Unless greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero by the middle of the century, the planet is on track to reach a level of global warming that would essentially wipe out the world’s coral reefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Xe3d6"&gt;There are other problems that could keep grasslands from coming back. The pH of the soil has become more acidic. There’s also a risk that new animals might disturb soil too much, so that it actually exposes permafrost to melting faster. Whether the animals protect or perturb existing permafrost depends partly on their behavior — which at this point is still a big unknown, as they do not exist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD85hc"&gt;“Scaling the effect from the small herd scale to the entire permafrost zone which impacts climate also seems futuristic rather than something that can help anytime soon, even if it did help at all,” Ted Schuur, regents’ professor of ecosystem ecology at Northern State University wrote to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B9wfVV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“futuristic rather than something that can help anytime soon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0Z2PG"&gt;Even if everything goes as planned for Colossal, Lamm thinks it would take about six years to birth a hybrid calf. Then it would take another fourteen years or so for their first animal to be old enough to reproduce. From there, the efforts would need to scale up massively to have any meaningful effect on the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. But even that best-case scenario comes too late for urgent climate goals. It’s nowhere near soon enough to help save coral reefs, which will need global emissions to drop by half by the end of the decade if they are to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEKd35"&gt;To tackle the climate crisis, the world needs deep and immediate cuts to greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. Climate action ought to focus on addressing that pollution that’s at the root of the climate crisis, Bennett says, and not on projects that have a massive profile and an uncertain impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saRVDm"&gt;“My big concern with these things is that investors will be looking to offset their climate footprint, and they’ll look for things to do and somebody will look at something like that and be like, ‘Oh this is cool,’” says Bennett. “It’s a highly, highly risky prospect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVadSM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hcmB0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7u5nyjXL1Lj3DAf27mMr4pPXV8=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860644/i13p2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPEBtq"&gt;Cameras continue to be one of the biggest differentiators in smartphones, and Apple’s iPhone lineup is no different. Apple says the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the company’s “most advanced dual-camera system ever,” while the 13 Pro and Pro Max have “our three most powerful cameras ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dWYGH"&gt;Which you’d hope for, of course. But this year, Apple really does appear to be making a big push with its cameras, particularly with the Pro models. As ever, the question will be what Apple is able to wring out of its hardware with image processing and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQGoWi"&gt;The iPhone 13 lineup represents the first time Apple has increased the primary camera’s sensor size across the board since the iPhone XS and XR in 2018, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21515571/iphone-12-pro-max-camera-quality-features"&gt;last year’s 12 Pro Max had a 47 percent bigger sensor&lt;/a&gt; than the 12 and 12 Pro. Sensor size is a key factor in image quality because, together with lens aperture, it determines how much light the camera is able to capture. More light, less noise and blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tK52o"&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini’s main cameras have bigger sensors, which is part of the reason why it and the ultrawide are now arranged diagonally in the camera bump. Apple also added sensor-shift optical image stabilization, a feature first seen on the 12 Pro Max. It’s not clear exactly how big the 13’s sensor is, but Apple says it’ll capture 47 percent more light than the 12. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEUG2VZhfv8_aShe9BOhPHTybhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852177/i13p.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nyxfXN"&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have a even bigger primary sensor and slightly faster f/1.5 lens that capture 2.2 times as much light as before, according to Apple. Again, the exact sensor size hasn’t been advertised, but Apple did give the pixel size: it’s 1.9μm, which is bigger than any modern smartphone I’m aware of. Apple can do this because the sensor is a relatively low-resolution 12 megapixels, but it’s still an impressive stat that should translate to better low-light performance. For comparison, the 12 Pro Max had 1.7μm pixels, while every other iPhone since the XS has had 1.4μm pixels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52XSSS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple isn’t outgunning Android phones on hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2R1t8"&gt;It’s not clear exactly what hardware changes Apple has made to the iPhone 13’s ultrawide camera; the company simply says it has a “faster sensor” that “reveals more detail in the dark areas of your photos.” The Pro does have significant hardware tweaks, though, since Apple has increased the aperture to f/1.8 for a 92-percent improvement in light-gathering capability. The sensor also now has focus pixels on board — things are rarely out of focus in ultrawide shots because the depth of field is so large, but adding autofocus means that the camera can be used for macro photography, with a focusing distance of 2cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rwrb4"&gt;The telephoto camera remains exclusive to the 13 Pro phones, and Apple has increased its equivalent focal length to 77mm, or three times longer than the primary camera. Previously the iPhone 12 Pro’s telephoto offered 2x zoom while the 12 Pro Max went out to 2.5x. There’s a tradeoff here — if you want to frame something with 2x zoom, the 13 Pro will need to crop in from the main camera, reducing image quality. But your pictures that go beyond 3x zoom will be much sharper than before, and it should make for a better portrait lens. Apple has also added Night mode to the telephoto for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J64QBL"&gt;When compared to the Android competition, Apple isn’t doing much to outgun them on the hardware front. The large 1.9μm pixels are noteworthy, but most Android phone makers have been prioritizing big, high-resolution sensors rather than pure pixel size. Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra, for example, has a huge 50-megapixel sensor with 1.4μm pixels, meaning it has decent light-gathering ability even when shot at native resolution without binning the pixels together. And while the 3x telephoto lens is going to be useful, it’s now common to see 5x periscope telephotos (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;or occasionally even 10x&lt;/a&gt;) in the Android world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMDyp54O2X93mx0f_YJVBUgkqvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852176/camera_system__f9pkhq4g2oy2_large_2x.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYXY1o"&gt;So even though Apple has made meaningful hardware improvements across the iPhone 13 lineup, as ever its performance relative to competitors will come down to how well its software and image processing pipeline has been optimized. The iPhone 11 was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;hugely better camera&lt;/a&gt; than the XS the year before it, after all, even though the hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/11/20860442/apple-iphone-11-camera-analysis-competition"&gt;barely changed&lt;/a&gt;. This year Apple is touting Smart HDR 4, which is capable of individually adjusting exposure for multiple people in the frame, but we’ll have to see the phones for ourselves to know what kind of a difference that makes. The same goes for Photographic Styles, a new filter-like feature that Apple says is smarter about adjusting elements like skin tones and skies in each photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIuJtD"&gt;As for video, Apple is making a big deal out of its Cinematic mode that lets you selectively adjust focus and depth of field when post-processing, like Portrait mode for photos. That’s something we’ll definitely have to test extensively. The 13 Pro, meanwhile, lets you record and edit video in Apple’s ProRes codec on the phone itself, or you can export the ProRes file to Final Cut Pro on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccov7C"&gt;All the usual caveats about waiting for full reviews most certainly still apply, but this is looking like a pretty good year for the iPhone camera. Apple is never going to have the flashiest hardware, but it’s made some welcome improvements in areas that make sense, and thankfully it hasn’t locked any features to the Max-sized iPhone. We’re looking forward to seeing the results — as well as those of looming competitors like the Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG now makes a 2,000 pound TV that costs $1.7 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jKwClmLHvAawzeuLaPOcrxZ8v8=/1x0:1075x716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860628/8K_UltraHDmain.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less “big TV” more “projector replacement.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bz2a6b"&gt;LG has announced a new lineup of Direct View LED (DVLED) home cinema displays, which range in size from a huge 108-inch HD screen to an obscene 325-inch 8K panel that costs an eye-watering $1.7 million, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/lgs-outrageous-direct-view-led-tv-tops-out-at-335-inches-1-7-million/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and weighs in at over 2,000 pounds. The company has previously reserved these displays for commercial buyers, but now it’ll sell them to anyone with pockets deep enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYtN53"&gt;Obviously, these screen sizes mean the home theater displays aren’t going to fit in a lot of houses, a limitation that’s likely to have a lot to do with the display technology they’re using. Rather than using an LCD layer to create pixels, and lighting it with separate LEDs, these displays just use LEDs (with some using smaller MicroLEDs, according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;), similar to what we’ve seen from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677384/samsung-the-wall-luxury-8k-micro-led-modular-size-292-inches-2k-73-inches"&gt;Samsung’s The Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217554/sony-selling-microled-production-display-mandalorian-production"&gt;Sony’s Crystal LED lineup&lt;/a&gt;. This has the advantage of creating better contrast levels like what you’d see from an OLED display, because individual pixels can turn off entirely to create deeper black levels, without the risk of burn-in. But the challenge with this approach is making LEDs small enough to work as individual subpixels, hence why these early DVLED screens are so dang big. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZDxHUz86mkkf1TcW2iZfOCTXaBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852149/4k_UHD_393.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ultrawide version for the multi-taskers in your household.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQtXt1"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; points out, it’s better to think of LG’s new DVLED displays as a replacement for a high-end projector that can already create an image of 100-inches or larger. Obviously a DVLED is a lot more expensive, but you’re left with a screen that gets bright enough to use in a well-lit room, unlike the dungeons that most projectors prefer. Peak brightness output for most of these LG screens sits at 1,200 nits, which is comparable to a regular high-end TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0xhxX"&gt;Most of the screens are offered in a regular 16:9 aspect ratio, but LG is also selling 32:9 versions in case you want to watch two video feeds side by side (or perhaps watch a film while you grind for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;loot). In case you needed any more reassurances about how expensive this display is, LG will ship it to you in a full-on flight case, which even the company admits is “overkill.” All in all, it’s a package that almost starts to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577063/lg-oled-r-rollable-tv-us-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;LG’s $100,000 rollable OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; look reasonable in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VF4wbq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGNVfE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford, Argo, and Walmart are bringing robo-delivery to three US cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIW1XfGy_OI49ht9LXomPHxH77M=/68x0:3935x2578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860575/Argo_Walmart_exterior_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;(Photo by Jared Wickerham/Argo AI)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Frz4iL"&gt;Ford and Walmart are teaming to launch a robo-delivery service in three US cities, using autonomous test vehicles equipped with sensors and software developed by Argo AI. Customers who live in Miami, Austin, and Washington, DC, who order items from Walmart online and live within a specific geographic area may be eligible to have their items delivered by a Ford/Argo vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s43qoq"&gt;The companies plan on kicking off “integration testing” for the delivery service this year, with plans to expand the geographic areas over time. Autonomous delivery is seen as a potentially lucrative market, with online grocery shopping growing fivefold over the next decade and American consumers spending upward of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according to a recent report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPIfHn"&gt;Ford has been experimenting with robo-delivery for a number of years now. In 2018, it announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18087898/ford-walmart-postmates-self-driving-grocery-delivery-miami"&gt;grocery delivery pilot with Walmart and Postmates&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker also helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16213544/dominos-ford-pizza-self-driving-car"&gt;Domino’s deliver pizza&lt;/a&gt; using its autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hfPhNQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford has been experimenting with robo-delivery for a number of years now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hknh0v"&gt;There are still a lot of hurdles to work out. The vehicles will require human monitors, both behind the wheel as well as from remote command centers, so any potential labor savings would still be years away. Customers would have to retrieve their deliveries from the vehicles, which could pose problems for elderly and disabled customers, as well as people who live in apartment buildings and are accustomed to delivery workers bringing their orders to their door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGIc8m"&gt;Ford isn’t the only company that’s trying to work through these challenges. Cruise, which is backed by General Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557603/cruise-walmart-autonomous-vehicles-delivery-arizona"&gt;has its own pilot project with Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona. In fact, the retail giant is hedging its bets by forging non-exclusive partnerships with a wide-range of AV operators, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004678/nuros-driverless-delivery-robots-walmart-houston"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611760/waymo-walmart-self-driving-vehicles-groceries-discounts"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65AUNZ"&gt;Delivery is just one aspect of Ford’s plan to commercialize autonomous vehicles. The automaker recently announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585764/ford-argo-lyft-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi-miami-austin"&gt;partnering with Lyft&lt;/a&gt; to deploy robotaxis in the same three cities before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlMzcM"&gt;In addition to Austin, Miami, and DC, Ford and Argo have been testing their fourth-generation vehicles in Pittsburgh, Detroit, and California. Argo is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany"&gt;preparing to launch an autonomous micro-transit and delivery service with VW&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, using its fifth-generation autonomous technology, starting in 2025. The AV company is rumored to be mulling an initial public offering at a $12.4 billion valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
