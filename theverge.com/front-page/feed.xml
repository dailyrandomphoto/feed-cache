    <title>Amazon boosts renewable energy purchases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Continues To Hire As Demand Soars During Coronavirus Shutdown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HYVSdXojtDp05yoZKnAAr6gBnFs=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490023/1218796210.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s884kP"&gt;Amazon now claims that it is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. The company’s investment in wind and solar projects grew to 6.5 GW, enough to power 1.7 million homes in the US for a year. That surpasses Google, which previously said it held the title as the biggest corporate buyer with &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-biggest-renewable-energy-purchase-ever/"&gt;5.5 GW of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; projects under contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ckgaTZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon surpasses Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5cpAqp"&gt;The move is part of Amazon’s commitment to limit the damage it does to the planet. Last year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;pledged to reach net zero&lt;/a&gt; carbon dioxide emissions by 2040, meaning it will take measures to reduce its planet-heating pollution as much as possible and then cancel out the rest with carbon offsets. It also said its physical infrastructure would run completely on renewables by 2030, a goal that CEO Jeff Bezos said the company is now on track to meet five years early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeCZZj"&gt;The online retail behemoth announced 26 new solar and wind projects in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the US. That brings its total to 127 renewable energy projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR0sXu"&gt;“I couldn’t be more proud of all the teams across Amazon that continue to work hard, smart, and fast to get these projects up and running,” Bezos said in a &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-becomes-worlds-largest-corporate-purchaser-renewable"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. Bezos has pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;$10 billion&lt;/a&gt; of his own money to fund action on climate change, while Amazon started a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;$2 billion&lt;/a&gt; climate pledge fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="X04FGE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s carbon footprint has continued to rise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPl9np"&gt;Despite the big claims Amazon is making about its sustainability goals, the company’s carbon footprint has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continued to rise&lt;/a&gt;. Its greenhouse gas emissions grew by &lt;a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/pdfBuilderDownload?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=7&amp;amp;imprToken=e6bb2663-6cb7-7337-d91&amp;amp;name=sustainability-all-in-june-2020&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21064468%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD"&gt;15 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 as sales increased. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;more people shopping online&lt;/a&gt; this year, Amazon’s profit has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic — a telltale sign that Amazon’s pollution could keep growing, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook outage is disrupting Messenger and Instagram DMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oFcDkPS2m_e12Yq7Sob3IL10dSU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489977/acastro_200305_1777_messenger_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i7NiBq"&gt;You might run into trouble messaging someone on Facebook or Instagram today. A service outage seems to have taken down Facebook Messenger and Instagram DMs for many users, with new messages failing to send and old messages failing to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuM82S"&gt;The outage appears to have started around 4:30AM ET, and it only seem to have gotten worse (or, at least, more widely noticed) in the hours since. The website Downdetector, which monitors website outages, shows a spike in user reports of issues with these services that’s continued to grow steeply as of closer to 9AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flWEjt"&gt;Facebook’s services aren’t broken for everyone — I was able to send a message on Facebook, though there was a delay before the message went through. But many people have reported being unable to load messages at all on either platform. It’s not clear whether the issue extends to WhatsApp, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV3NFF"&gt;Service outages happen every now and then, but the breadth of this latest disruption is in many ways Facebook’s own doing. The company has been integrating Facebook Messenger and Instagram DMs. Now that they share infrastructure, it seems that an outage for one may mean an outage for the other, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej6VuN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Facebook for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica’s SL2-S trades resolution for speed and sensitivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgBp3wr7dJz1D0YkTaJu_LbpYn8=/0x2:6000x4002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489968/SL2_S_Ambients_CL_7_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Leica SL2-S | Photo: Leica&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MY0BzY"&gt;Leica is expanding its line of full-frame interchangeable lens mirrorless cameras with the new SL2-S. As its name implies, the SL2-S is a variation of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950534/leica-sl2-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-ibis-price-specs-announcement-features"&gt;SL2 that came out last year&lt;/a&gt; and it shares many features and similarities with that camera. But that S tagged on to the end means it is something different, and it might as well stand for speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqphul"&gt;The SL2-S has the same body, design, build quality, LCD touchscreen, viewfinder, battery, in-body image stabilization, and autofocus system as the SL2. What’s different is its sensor: instead of the high-resolution 47.3-megapixel chip found in the SL2, the SL2-S has a brand-new, backside illuminated 24-megapixel sensor. That lower resolution allows it to capture up to 25 frames per second with its electronic shutter (9 frames per second with the mechanical) and the backside illumination gives it a greater ISO range and better low light performance over the SL2. It’s the first backside-illuminated sensor to be used by Leica.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MDmNfA8ETDxgUbKUO8-PfNcJSWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158513/SL2_S_Ambients_CL_1_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The SL2-S has the same design and weatherproofing as the SL2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="82TpCh"&gt;The SL2-S can shoot at up to ISO 100,000 and the company claims it has both lower noise and better color when at extremely high ISO levels. The camera’s multi shotmode can combine up to 8 shots into a single 96-megapixel image, if you find you’re needing more resolution. Thanks to its 4GB internal buffer, the SL2-S can shoot continuous bursts of JPEG images at 9 frames per second until the SD cards in its two UHS-II slots are full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwj5VV"&gt;Like the SL2, the SL2-S has separate photo and video modes, allowing you to customize the camera’s functions and settings for each task and switch between them. It can capture 4K 10-bit 4:2:2 and Cinema 4K ProRES footage up to 30fps to an SD card, or up to 60fps to an external recorder through its full-size HDMI port. It also has L-log recording with two built-in LUTs to make it easier to see what the edited version will look like. Leica says it plans to release more LUTs in the future, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDoYIl"&gt;Aside from its internal differences, the SL2-S is almost a direct clone of the SL2, with the same, chunky milled aluminum top and bottom connected to a magnesium alloy frame. Its 5.76-megapixel OLED viewfinder is only outclassed by the one in Sony’s recent A7S III, and the body has IP54 dust and water protection and is guaranteed to work in temps as low as negative 10 Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n9dJOelSdXp7luZbHPF1cr7zV7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158512/SL2_S_BTS_CL_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The SL2-S has dedicated modes for photo and video settings.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i0tR0N"&gt;Leica says that it is planning to release a firmware update in the first half of 2021 that will add a number of new features, including an improved autofocus algorithm, focus tracking, internal 4K 60p recording, Long-GOP recording, segmented video, automatic follow focus, a wave form monitor, tally mode, color bars, and an enhanced live view for low light shooting. The SL2-S (as well as the SL2 and S3) are now fully supported in Capture One, allowing photographers another software option for tethered shooting in addition to Lightroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMrQqT"&gt;The SL2-S is slated to begin shipping immediately for $4,895, about $1,100 less than the SL2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlFdgS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods Max first look: lots to prove</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpHqQubstLK_bgtpOF_Eff-1kao=/0x249:1000x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489888/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At $549, they need to deliver more than just good sound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Xczc3j"&gt;I’ve been playing with Apple’s new $549 AirPods Max over-ear headphones since yesterday afternoon, and so far they sound very nice and fit very comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMlMIj"&gt;They also — I have to say this — have a distinct smell, like a funky riff on new-car smell. I am pretty sure that’s a byproduct of the memory foam earpads rolling off the manufacturing line and straight into a shipping box to my house, and I’m reliably told it will fade away over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5UCFZ"&gt;I would probably not tell you what a pair of $100 headphones smells like. But at $550, I feel compelled to note that the AirPods Max are a multisensory experience out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max headband" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jJQLigb9MPDQnoYs35H51arBnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159216/npatel_201209_4332_0036.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2rVS8D"&gt;Design-wise, the AirPods Max are an interesting blend of classic only-Apple design flourishes and odd incongruities. The headband is stainless steel covered in white rubbery material, with a “breathable mesh knit canopy” across the top; Apple says this distributes the weight of the headphones more evenly across your head. (I can’t say it feels very much different than my Sony WH-1000M2s, but it’s possible I just have a very large head.) The headband connects to the earcups with adjustable stainless-steel extensions culminating in a pleasantly spring-loaded hinge, all of which is nicer than any other premium headphones I’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max bottom" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcDSPV8w6-QPYFuGbVVpXtYrgBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159219/npatel_201209_4332_0033.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y45TJP"&gt;The fairly large earcups are where things get a little messier. I have the silver AirPods Max, and the vast expanse of flattish aluminum does not look at first glance like $550 — it’s possible the other colors look more premium, but you would be forgiven for thinking these are plastic until you touch them and feel the coldness of metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnrWIw"&gt;The earcups are not smooth, unbroken surfaces. There are 10 slots of various shapes and sizes cut into the earcup shells. Seven of those are microphones: six used for noise-cancellation and another for voice calls. (There are another two mics inside the earcups.) These slots are not symmetrical; the top of the left earcup has one long slot, one short one, and then three more slots on the bottom along with a long gray plastic antenna line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJh2zE"&gt;There are two slots on top of the right earcup, and there are three more on the bottom, in addition to a small status LED and the Lightning port, which Apple chose over USB-C to be more convenient for all the iPhone users out there. The AirPods Max can be charged to its full 20-hour battery life in two hours from the standard 5W iPhone brick, and run for 90 minutes after just five minutes on the charger. (There’s no fast-charging available, even if you use a USB-C to Lightning cable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXA48ZX3DznrRvhOK_bRyXXMk14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159220/npatel_201209_4332_0029.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max digital crown compared to Apple Watch digital crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-MdApQafu_eT_aX8HAeMOhg3Fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159327/npatel_201209_4332_0058.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmCN7U"&gt;The right earcup also has a button to switch between noise-cancelling and transparency mode, as well as a Digital Crown volume control you can press to play and pause music, and hold to invoke Siri. (You can also just say “Hey Siri,” which worked well enough.) One note on the crown: it’s much bigger than the one that appears on an Apple Watch, so it doesn’t feel too awkward to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHINMW"&gt;All of this is to say: there’s a lot going on visually with the AirPods Max, much more so than you’d expect from a pair of $550 Apple headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEs7cF"&gt;One thing you will not find: a 3.5mm or 2.5mm analog audio input, which is standard issue on noise-canceling headphones at this price point — that’s how you plug into an airplane seat-back entertainment system to watch the movie. Apple knows this is a common use case, because it is selling a $35 3.5mm-to-Lightning cable for exactly that purpose. That brings you to $585 for the AirPods Max, which is just $15 less than an entire iPhone 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEsjtRbdI_mi8xja_w72EzH2zyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159326/npatel_201209_4332_0060.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max earcup removed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EZT5t8fkJEkWPnKf2xtfgq5ZUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159325/npatel_201209_4332_0063.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gs7QJy"&gt;The memory-foam earcups are very comfortable, and attach magnetically — they remain firmly in place, but come out easily when you need them to. Underneath, there’s white plastic, and a window for the sensor that detects your ears — the music automatically stops when you take the headphones off, or even just lift one earcup to talk to someone. The AirPods Max don’t have a power button, which is very Apple; they just go to sleep when they haven’t been on your head for a while, and then wake up when you put them back on. Clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The back of the AirPods Max case exposes where the material comes through itself and is glued in place.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwopur"&gt;I have no idea what’s going on with the AirPods Max case, which is a goofy one-piece contraption that’s folded and glued over on itself to form a case. It looks very much like a purse when wrapped around the headphones, which is at once fun and clever and also not the point of a headphones case that needs to survive in a backpack. It does not appear very protective, feels like it will get dirty fast, and generally does not hold a candle to the nice hard cases that come with almost every other set of premium headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfBRLU"&gt;It is one of the cheaper-feeling things Apple has ever made, in my estimation — the second in a trend that started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;the MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. I hope there is not a third thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdN0YCZxjqQakcK-QGhVd9SF1AY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159213/npatel_201209_4332_0043.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max case interior" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7M5FimbBvOA3OSPoBGM0Hpin6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159210/npatel_201209_4332_0047.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NT1X03"&gt;Sound-wise, I’ve had fun listening to the AirPods Max for a few hours — they’re crisp and bright, with a pleasingly wider soundstage than my Sony headphones, and no distortion at all, even at max volume. We’ll have a full review of these soon, including tests of spatial audio and Apple’s claim of Atmos surround sound support, so stay tuned for that. But for now, rest assured the AirPods Max sound more than good enough to compete with other high-end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqKGEP"&gt;Of course, those competing headphones are all cheaper — much cheaper — than the AirPods Max. The newest Sony WH-MX1000M4s are regularly on sale for $300, sound very good, and have a 10-hour-longer battery life. The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are $339, also sound very good, and have brand cachet that’s known in first-class cabins the world over. (They also both have audio-in jacks for those seat-back entertainment systems.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PcYNBI"&gt;Whether Apple has actually done enough here to justify the staggering premium over the competition is an open question that it’ll take us a little more time reviewing to answer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shopping is coming to Instagram Reels globally, turning the whole app into a catalog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHybIGMiH7UY4FjCzLf4tnmrzHo=/0x0:2436x1624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489566/shoppingreels.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oFdEt3"&gt;Instagram is covering its app with shopping content. Today, the company announced that shopping is rolling out to Reels, its TikTok copycat product, around the world. It announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21499179/facebook-reels-shopping-igtv-retail"&gt;test of this feature&lt;/a&gt; in October. Businesses and creators will be able to tag products when they create Reels, and viewers can tap through those tags to buy or save them. A branded content tag is also available for influencers who are paid for their posts. With this rollout, Instagram now has shopping available in every format on the app — the Feed, Stories, IGTV, and Live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksGWCC"&gt;Shopping is important to Instagram, and Facebook more broadly, as it looks to diversify its revenue. Ads are the primary way both platforms make money, but shopping presents an opportunity to profit off sales fees. In Instagram’s case, people already look for product inspiration, so giving them the option to buy directly from the app streamlines that process. It even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;completely redesigned&lt;/a&gt; the home screen to emphasize shopping and Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3JBtA"&gt;Meanwhile, TikTok is &lt;a href="https://news.shopify.com/dancing-to-a-new-beat-shopify-brings-commerce-to-tiktok"&gt;partnering with Shopify&lt;/a&gt; to launch new shopping features, including a test that would let Shopify users tag stores in their videos with a “shop now” button. Reels only widely launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; and is already being used for shopping, which speaks to just how important commerce is to the company and how badly it wants to beat TikTok to the punch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Amazon fined €135M over misuse of cookies by French data watchdog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WZKKYS0EoNHTMAQGHoXJRhr-_4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489546/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pFgRMc"&gt;France’s data protection regulator, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés or CNIL, has fined &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-financial-penalties-60-million-euros-against-company-google-llc-and-40-million-euros-google-ireland"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-financial-penalty-35-million-euros-imposed-company-amazon-europe-core"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; a total of €135 million (around $163 million) between them for violating the country’s data protection laws. Google was fined a total of €100 million (around $121 million), while Amazon was fined €35 million (around $42 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NO6I4D"&gt;In both cases, CNIL’s complaints were similar. It said that in the past, when users visited either company’s French website, cookies — including some used for advertising — were placed on their devices without prior consent. Although both have since updated their websites to require a user’s consent before placing cookies, the regulator criticized their cookie information banners for not providing enough information, or for making it clear enough that visitors can turn down these cookies. The regulator gave both a deadline of three months to fix the outstanding issues, or risk being fined €100,000 (around $120,000) per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVPOKH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regulator’s complaints about the two companies were similar&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fl6oIZ"&gt;Responding to news of the fine, a spokesperson from Amazon said the company disagreed with CNIL’s decision. “We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators and fully comply with all applicable laws in every country in which we operate,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfUlMx"&gt;Google also pushed back against the regulator, and said it stands by its efforts to provide information about tracking and control to users. “Today’s decision under French ePrivacy laws overlooks these efforts and doesn’t account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving. We will continue to engage with the CNIL as we make ongoing improvements to better understand its concerns,” a spokesperson from Google said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDgTQt"&gt;The latest fines provide more evidence that European regulators are serious about enforcing data privacy rules, which have strengthened considerably in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-12-10/google-amazon-fined-163-million-by-french-data-watchdog?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that CNIL’s latest fine for Google is double its previous record fine, also levied against Google. Google has so far been fined over €8 billion in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18270891/google-eu-antitrust-fine-adsense-advertising"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;antitrust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/27/15872354/google-eu-fine-antitrust-shopping"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt; brought by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe wallet now has competition that’s cheaper and packs more features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of an iPhone 12 Pro with the MOFT wallet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krrV0MtswKY7cqpe-ssIASsuOF8=/0x181:1869x1427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489392/MOFT_X_MagSafe_Compatible_Blue_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: MOFT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1Y4s6"&gt;MOFT is a company that’s made iPhone accessories in the past, and it’s now releasing a competitor to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHLT3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-saddle-brown%3Ffnode%3Dcd4158bd6fb3c664a3d8c1e0372c57a949246fc0923dca31434702ad4183a1e0fe0eb444a601d27d893d29cc7564166f1632fb24dc980401eba03a25a98db09f6a089fa7d1b8f04bbb039db4cade0792b2fdbe5776534ccb497cd035f2f4033c58f07f88108ecfffcc7f6dbe55c727d5%26fs%3Df%253Dwallet%2526fh%253D12b2bf%25252B4667&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22151212%2Fmagsafe-wallet-iphone-accessory-moft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s $50 MagSafe wallet&lt;/a&gt;. MOFT’s version, &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/pages/moft-snap-on-phone-stand-wallet-magsafe-compatible"&gt;which goes on sale today&lt;/a&gt;, costs only $30 and holds three cards like Apple’s, but it also has a built-in kickstand. The stand lets users keep their phone upright in portrait, landscape, or what the company is calling “float mode”, which you can see in the image below. It’s made of vegan leather, as opposed to Apple’s “European leather”, which makes it an option for people who don’t want to use animal-based products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of a phone attached to the case in landscape, portrait, and float mode. Float mode involves the case sitting vertically with the phone being held horizontally." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jyNwAg1chRL9BTWyq8Izxx3r8SA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146306/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: MOFT&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using magnets instead of adhesive makes the float mode possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gznwcB"&gt;This new accessory seems to be a tweaked version of &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/products/moft-x"&gt;MOFT’s existing X Phone stand&lt;/a&gt;, except now it’s using the iPhone 12’s MagSafe system to attach to the phone instead of adhesive. This means you’ll be able to take it on and off whenever you want, without having to worry about wearing out glue. The company even touts that you can make a wallet-MagSafe charger-iPhone sandwich to prop up your phone while charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Video of attaching the wallet to the back of a MagSafe charging puck and using it as a stand" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92XDK8R473UcUz_C4w5myxvCvls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142683/GIF5.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: MOFT&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the wallet as a stand while charging your phone with the MagSafe charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="syeAg9"&gt;It also has magnets on both sides, meaning that you could also stick it to any magnetic metal surface (though if you want to stick it to a non-magnetic surface, MOFT will happily sell you their &lt;a href="https://www.moft.us/products/moft-magnetic-sticky-pads"&gt;magnetic sticky pads&lt;/a&gt; for $10, or include one with the case for an extra $5). This is something I’ve already found myself doing. For example, I’ve stuck my phone to the fridge while trying to talk to someone and cook at the same time (though I’d hope the MOFT case would stick better, as my phone slowly drops the longer I leave it on there).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Picture of a phone magnetically stuck to the side of a refrigerator" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wsw0e38z3MlEHM82rAl-3w9Wp9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142437/Fridge_phone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technically this is something you can do with Apple’s MagSafe case, but it’s a bit perilous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FVO9oQ"&gt;The combo wallet/stand is one of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall-accessories%2Fmagsafe%3Fpage%3D1%26f%3Dwallet%26fh%3D12b2bf%252B4667&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22151212%2Fmagsafe-wallet-iphone-accessory-moft#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the few MagSafe-compatible accessories&lt;/a&gt; that have hit the market since&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21508028/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-homepod-mini-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt; Apple announced the iPhone 12 in mid-October&lt;/a&gt;, which seems curious as these products should be reasonably easy to make: you take your product and add magnets (oh, and probably some shielding if it’s a wallet). As the owner of a MagSafe-compatible phone, though, this isn’t the wallet for me. I’m just not able to squeeze down to only three cards. You may also want to check out &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MOFT-Ultra-Light-Invisible-Foldaway-Stand-Starry/dp/B07Z4QM4RD/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=moft&amp;amp;qid=1607023665&amp;amp;sr=8-8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Amazon reviews of MOFT’s existing case&lt;/a&gt; to see if the number of users reporting build-quality issues concerns you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN3JXg"&gt;If you’re looking for something that does even more than the Moft accessory, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"&gt;Peak Design case/accessory system that’s currently being crowdfunded&lt;/a&gt; may be worth a &lt;s&gt;peak&lt;/s&gt; look (though it’s a much higher buy-in price than the MOFT). Whether you decide to wait for that, go with MOFT’s or Apple’s offerings, or do something else entirely, we probably agree that the introduction of magnets has made the future of the accessories for iPhones pretty interesting (as long as companies continue to come out with products).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 will reportedly launch on January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcJq-ueBQpDzH1NwS1u3tptlBFA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68489320/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaser videos of the upcoming phones recently leaked online.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SBin3R"&gt;Samsung’s next flagship smartphone lineup, the Galaxy S21 series, will launch globally on January 14th, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-launch-date-india-availability-1184543/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The date was revealed by Samsung’s largest mobile experience store in India, and &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-surprise-preorders-launch-date-confirmed-india"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;subsequently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the date with a company official at Samsung’s local offices. Although &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports this as the global launch date, Samsung HQ has yet to confirm it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MZSEn"&gt;Although a January launch is earlier than the February Unpacked events we’ve become accustomed to in recent years, this isn’t the first time this date has been rumored. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a January 14th launch based on its own sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VWujP"&gt;The phones will reportedly go on sale on January 29th in India, according to employees at Samsung’s Opera House outlet in Bengaluru, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; reports. The store is taking preorders for three upcoming handsets, the Galaxy S21, the S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra, with a Rs 2,000 (around $27) deposit. Full pricing for the lineup is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0zZc6u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sales will reportedly start later that month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4nOBU"&gt;Along with confirming the launch plans, the new report from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority &lt;/em&gt;has also revealed some of the upcoming handsets’ specs. They’ll apparently be powered by Samsung’s Exynos 2100 processor in India, and the three models will be available in the following colors: gray, pink, purple, and white for the S21; pink, purple, silver and black for the S21 Plus; and black and silver for the S21 Ultra. &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; says the S21 Ultra will have a 108-megapixel main sensor, alongside two additional 10-megapixel sensors, one of which will have a 10x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umdeJt"&gt;The latest report adds to a host of leaked details about the new handsets. Earlier this week we got an early look at the phones through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;series of leaked teaser trailers&lt;/a&gt;, which show off their redesigned camera bumps. The trailers appear to confirm that the S21 Ultra will have a total of five cameras, compared to three on the S21 and S21 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na3432"&gt;The trailers &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;followed a report in November&lt;/a&gt; which said that each of the phones will come with 120Hz displays, and will have screens ranging from 6.2 to 6.8-inches in size. Internally, they’ll reportedly have batteries ranging in size from 4,000 mAh to 5,000 mAh, and will be powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor in regions that don’t use Samsung’s own processors. The S21 Ultra is also expected to be compatible with Samsung’s S-Pen, which is important considering the rumors that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;stylus-equipped Note lineup is being discontinued&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1iJAwm"&gt;Google is launching new vaccine information panels in its search results to counter misinformation and educate people about what’s available in their location, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/accurate-timely-information-covid-19-vaccines/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The panels are rolling out starting in the United Kingdom, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/02/pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-wins-licence-for-use-in-the-uk"&gt;is approved&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/coventry-woman-90-first-patient-to-receive-covid-vaccine-in-nhs-campaign"&gt;is being administered&lt;/a&gt;, and will be introduced in more countries as local health authorities begin authorizing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCcju9"&gt;The panels include information on each individual vaccine, and aim to address vaccine misinformation, and give guidance about how, when, and where people can receive the shots. Google has used similar information panels to share information &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/21/21189051/google-coronavirus-website-launches-covid19-trump-enhanced-search-results"&gt;about COVID-19 generally&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225828/google-showing-covid-19-testing-centers-search-results"&gt;locations of testing centers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information panels will provide information about approved vaccines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ix05wW"&gt;In addition to search results, Google says it is sharing similar vaccine information via its COVID-19 panels on YouTube. These were first launched in March to share information about the pandemic, and Google says they’ve been viewed over 400 billion times since. Google has also been cracking down on anti-vax content on YouTube, and announced in October that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515796/youtube-covid-vaccine-misniformation-policy"&gt;remove videos containing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It now says it’s removed over 700,000 videos “related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXu8c2"&gt;Finally, Google has announced it’s providing more funds to help health authorities and the media provide useful information about vaccines and debunk misinformation. The company is providing an additional $15 million in ad grants to the World Health Organization to help it promote health initiatives, and it’s spending $1.5 million to support fact-checking research and fund a COVID-19 Vaccine Media Hub, which is intended to be a resource for journalists to help give them access to scientific expertise and research updates. It’s also funding research into how to counteract vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SSURA"&gt;In total, Google says it has launched over 200 products, features, and initiatives in response to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0IvF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former employees say Apple stood by while suppliers violated Chinese labor laws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Factory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZCyaMV3D9dfqcO6GRC5a2fbvMI=/18x0:693x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68488393/apple-factory.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Factory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YdEiwP"&gt;Apple has been complicit in its suppliers’ violations of Chinese labor laws, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-turned-blind-eye-to-supplier-breaches-of-chinese-labor-laws?utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;amp;utm_content=1002702&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=cio&amp;amp;utm_term=1000266"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Suppliers have periodically filled their factories with temporary workers or “dispatch labor,” violating a Chinese labor law requiring no more than 10 percent of a factory’s workers be temporary employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rILLI"&gt;Much like in the US, temporary employees in China receive lower pay and fewer benefits, and they’ve become increasingly common as interest in factory jobs has shrunk according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. The law limiting the use of dispatch labor came into effect in 2014, and that year Apple conducted a survey of its suppliers in China to determine how many already complied. The company found that among 362 factories, “nearly half were over the quota for temporary workers,” according to a presentation &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e75UuW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple took no major action against its suppliers for violating temp-worker labor laws&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lihBd2"&gt;Despite that figure, not much had changed by 2016 and the end of a grace period for complying. Three former members of Apple’s “supplier responsibility team” said that the company “took no major action against its suppliers for violating the temp-worker labor law out of concerns it would create costs, drain resources and delay product launches.” If the claims are true, it’s notable because Apple says it applies its supplier code of conduct policies equally across its supply chain, which should prevent these kinds of violations from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lAzcM"&gt;New data Apple collected in 2018 shows the problem continued. &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;says that a Quanta factory manufacturing Apple Watches hired 5,000 temporary workers to bring its workforce to 18,000. That’s around 27 percent temporary workers, above the 10 percent limit set by the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odzpaM"&gt;This isn’t the first time labor laws have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2012/2/8/2785448/foxconn-factory-working-conditions-company-responses"&gt;violated on Apple’s watch&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Apple actually admitted to at least a portion of this dispatch labor problem in its &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-foxconn-temporary-workers-china.html"&gt;dealings with Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. Foxconn had exceeded the 10 percent limit, despite previously agreeing multiple times to stop. And just last month another supplier, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556154/apple-supplier-pegatron-student-labor-violation"&gt;Pegatron, violated student labor laws&lt;/a&gt; and falsified its records to cover it up. Apple’s reported response was to put the company on “probation,” preventing it from conducting any new business with Apple until the problem was resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcEzRK"&gt;Despite the Pegatron example, punishments have still not been broadly applied.  Limits on temporary labor are an issue that all large tech companies manufacturing in China have likely been dealing with, but it’s Apple’s desire to “surprise and delight,” along with maintaining aggressive production quotas, that have potentially worsened the problem. In a quote from the report, an unnamed Apple executive admits as much: “We are making it difficult for our suppliers to comply with this law as 10% dispatch is simply not enough to cope with the spikes in labor demand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK8zhr"&gt;Apple is aware this is an issue, but until it’s willing to step in and take bolder action, suppliers will take shortcuts to keep Apple’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
