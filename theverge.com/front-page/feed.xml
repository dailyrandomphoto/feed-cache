    <title>Memes have broken the brokerages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O8-wE0wT01cHBQ0UBkFXvfpBh10=/0x0:4015x2677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729939/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezPUBA"&gt;In retrospect, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;stock memes were inevitable&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it looks like a lot of brokerages weren’t ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy25dD"&gt;Vanguard, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity Investments, among others, have been experiencing outages, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/outages-continue-to-plague-online-brokerages-11611768827"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. None of the brokerages would tell the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;specifically why the outages were happening. Also, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade are restricting trading around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;, as individual investors pile into these companies, &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjeIQs"&gt;See, GameStop stock rose an astounding 1,600 percent &lt;em&gt;in January alone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; points out. What happened is a little complex, but basically boils down to traders gathering on Reddit, Discord, and elsewhere to encourage others to buy call options on the stock. The internet’s exuberance over GameStop has also affected AMC, Bed Bath and Beyond, BlackBerry, Tootsie Roll, and other companies. The trading action has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-day-trader-army-fattens-fortunes-of-world-s-super-rich"&gt;further enriched some of the world’s richest people&lt;/a&gt;. It has also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/yellen-monitoring-gamestop-market-activity-psaki-says"&gt;caught the attention&lt;/a&gt; of Janet Yellen, the US Treasury secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHQR2N"&gt;Over the last decade, most of us have seen the power that social networks can bring to bear on politics, for instance, and media. Now, social networks are disrupting finance. The pandemic has more people day trading — 2020 was a record high in the volume of individual trading, Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities, told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;And collectives of retail traders can use platforms such as Discord, Twitch, and Reddit to coordinate their actions in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpISNX"&gt;Until recently, it was hard to imagine that doing a trade would be as easy as posting to Instagram, but here we are. And what’s more, trading is cheaper than ever — free at many brokerages — reducing further the amount of confidence an investor might need in a stock to buy options on it. Right now, Robinhood, a broker that allows free trades on stocks and options, is the most popular free app in Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPrZoD"&gt;The result of this frenzy is what appears to be a massive casino, but investors beware: at a casino, the house always wins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thursday is the last day to get Samsung’s Galaxy S21 preorder perks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVEQ1zJ93Z9oyJZ4H2T_Pn_Zk2g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729771/vpavic_210119_4378_0238.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7rHwLC"&gt;This isn’t new information but more of a PSA that you only have one more day to preorder the Galaxy S21, which will get you a few perks you wouldn’t get otherwise. Every major US carrier and most retailers are accepting preorders for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;S21&lt;/a&gt;, S21 Plus, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;high-end S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; through Thursday, January 28th. No matter where you buy it, you’ll get up to $200 in Samsung credit to pick up a few accessories on its site, along with a complimentary Samsung SmartTag to help keep track of your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6lCSB"&gt;If you want to dig into the preorder offers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225628/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-preorder-how-to-price-verizon-tmobile-sprint"&gt;check out my Taylor Lyles’ post&lt;/a&gt; that has everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fq8KEaz4JjxcXVhS9cLzIFGc_N4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20024038/69a25849ddc64410a0dc8d3a9ace0043.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 2K Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OKAAEo"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners who haven’t had the chance to play through the glorious &lt;em&gt;BioShock &lt;/em&gt;trilogy can do so for a really reasonable price from several retailers. Usually $50 for &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;, its sequel &lt;em&gt;BioShock 2&lt;/em&gt;, and the series finale &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, it’s just $20 for the physical version. This is well worth playing, especially since you can take it on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ICcvyd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nerf Rival Artemis XVII-3000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MmYCAf"&gt;This isn’t tech, but&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister (a Nerf connoisseur) thinks the Nerf Rival Artemis XVII-3000 is an excellent blaster, so this deal at Walmart popped out to him. Originally priced at $70, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNerf-Rival-Artemis-XVII-3000-Red%2F271354070&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $30 right now on Walmart’s site&lt;/a&gt;. It includes 30 rounds, so you’ll probably need to buy more if you want to do some prolonged target practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden made climate change a national security priority — what’s next?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An aerial view of a Russian nuclear icebreaker clearing a path in ice to North Pole" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mOMdO_444KsOI4jjRrfj6zVJosk=/0x2:2050x1369/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729722/GettyImages_200138853_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An aerial view of a Russian nuclear icebreaker clearing a path in ice to North Pole. | Photo by Per Breiehagen / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YcPRQF"&gt;President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order today that makes climate change a top US national security priority. He commissioned a “National Intelligence Estimate on the security implications of climate change.” He also directed the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to develop plans to adapt to a warming world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AvbBFY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Climate change could be deliberately “weaponized”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zRppq"&gt;The environmental and geopolitical risks from climate change are quickly evolving. We’ve already seen droughts exacerbate water and food scarcity, which can spark conflict. In the future, climate change could be deliberately “weaponized” in clashes over resources, according to Sherri Goodman, who served as deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security from 1993 to 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYi1bm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Goodman, who is now a senior fellow at the Wilson Center’s Environmental Change and Security Program and Polar Institute, just before Biden signed the executive order. She paints a picture of what risks might lie ahead and what the executive order might be able to accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khEgYh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or43W2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were the first person to call climate change a “threat multiplier,” a term that’s thrown around a lot now when we’re talking about the consequences of climate change. What’s changed since you first coined the term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9df8vm"&gt;We coined that phrase &lt;a href="https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/National%20Security%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Climate%20Change.pdf"&gt;in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, we were predicting what is now a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUxxon"&gt;The Arctic has warmed at two to three times the global average, with temperatures as high as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/charts-warm-siberian-town-hits-100-degrees-n1231787"&gt;100 degrees&lt;/a&gt; in Siberia. We now potentially face a global power competition in the Arctic as sea ice retreats and the Arctic region becomes more navigable. A whole new ocean has opened in our lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmM2JK"&gt;We need to understand how those climate threat multipliers have reshaped the way we see the world and the way you need to act responsibly within it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sherri Goodman, former deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security, speaks at the 2016 Concordia Summit on September 19th, 2016, in New York City.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hWgysG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What risks do you foresee growing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4wWns"&gt;The growing risks are that vulnerable populations become more so and that other nations begin to weaponize climate as part of their security strategies. Russia is already, for example, expanding its presence in its part of the Arctic — both for economic opportunities to convert the northern sea route into a toll road for transit from Asia to ports in Europe, as well as building up its military infrastructure. China, for example, envisions a polar “Silk Road,” where it will take advantage of retreating sea ice and being able to transit the Arctic. China has already put in place an ambitious program to increase its Arctic capabilities, particularly in science and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Fff5G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Water is becoming more precious and scarce.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AtSJSd"&gt;Agricultural growing areas shift with climate change. In the near to medium term, there are some winners and some losers. You need to understand how that’s going to affect global commodities — particularly food, grain, wheat, and water — as there becomes more competition for resources. We’re constantly thinking about competition for oil, which is not as valuable a resource now as it used to be. Water is becoming more precious and scarce. Wheat production is shifting to the northern region. Russia, for example, is already a major global wheat producer and will likely &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/16/magazine/russia-climate-migration-crisis.html"&gt;become more so in the future&lt;/a&gt;. Will it weaponize its sale of wheat in the global market in the way it did with gas sales to Ukraine some years ago, to use those resource assets as leverage? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHdZ2w"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m glad you mentioned the Arctic. For a lot of Americans, melting sea ice feels so far away. Can you bring home why the Arctic is so important for the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfMCU5"&gt;We have to remind ourselves, we are an Arctic Nation. Alaska is part of the United States. We have long been pioneers in the science and research for the Arctic region. Very rapid changes in the Arctic are evidence of changes occurring elsewhere in the planet, but occurring even more rapidly in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbPKOq"&gt;From a geopolitical perspective, nations around the world, particularly Russia and China, could see opportunities to potentially extract the vast energy and mineral resources, which lie below the seabed and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16398518/deep-sea-mining-hydrothermal-vents-japan-precious-metals-rare-species"&gt;could be exploited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onaexx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope Biden’s executive order can accomplish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rD5Hy9"&gt;The national security implications of climate change need to be clearly recognized throughout our national security and foreign policy, strategy, and plans. That means with respect to China, the Arctic, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, Africa, we need to understand changing environmental conditions. We need to understand how that change should shape our foreign policy and national security strategies, our interactions with allies and partners, and our competition with adversaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lHdIJd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The climate reality has already changed so much just in the last four years.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VGOhHA"&gt;And then, second, the Department of Defense, in particular, can lead by example in moving toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of Defense is one of the nation’s largest energy users. And it’s also subject to all the climate impacts that communities, cities around the country are. It has the same climate resilience challenge in terms of building back better and becoming climate-resilient. Whether it’s by electrifying its vehicle fleet, advancing micro grids and renewables on its bases, shoring up the resilience of its major coastal bases, or better protecting infrastructure from wildfire or permafrost collapse, the Department of Defense can lead by example in how the nation as a whole needs to become resilient to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYwOd0"&gt;The climate reality has already changed so much just in the last four years. The polar regions are melting. Permafrost is collapsing. Droughts are spreading. Extreme weather is more frequent and more intense. Wildfire season lasts all year. And so, the climate reality demands further action by the security community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykeQ7b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqVHOM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter troll faces 10 years in prison for spreading vote-by-text hoax</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6EILmCVedql9RWp6R2V2WXyQhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729716/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KYWpA"&gt;The United States Department of Justice announced today that it has charged a Twitter user who allegedly spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election using Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpCMLk"&gt;Douglass Mackey of West Palm Beach, Florida, is accused of conspiring with others to spread election misinformation in 2016, which was designed to deprive individuals of their constitutional right to vote. He has been charged with violating the civil rights conspiracy statute and, if convicted, will face up to 10 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSn0ur"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1360816/download"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; alleges that between September 2016 and November 2016, Mackey (who used the alias “Ricky Vaughn” on Twitter) spread fake information to his followers, trying to convince voters that it was possible to cast their vote by sending a text message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LZ8v7B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter suspended Mackey’s account several times for violating its terms of service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QwtrJD"&gt;According to the complaint, Mackey was associated with numerous pro-Trump group chats, including one under the name “War Room,” where several individuals shared ideas on how they could influence the 2016 election, according to prosecutors. One such example included an internet “Draft our Daughters meme,” which shared false information implying that if Hillary Clinton was president, she would support making women eligible for the draft. The complaint also details that in September 2016, 4,900 unique telephone numbers texted their votes to a number Mackey promoted on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt0OSz"&gt;Twitter suspended Mackey’s account several times for violating its terms of service. But on three separate occasions, Mackey returned with a separate account linked to the Ricky Vaughn alias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQQarK"&gt;Mackey remained anonymous until &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-white-nationalist-troll-ricky-vaughn_n_5ac53167e4b09ef3b2432627"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; identified&lt;/a&gt; him in a 2018 exposé. Mackey’s alias was ranked among the top 150 influencers of the 2016 election, ranking 107, according to an &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@socialmachines/who-s-influencing-election-2016-8bed68ddecc3"&gt;analysis conducted by MIT’s Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s motorized Echo Show 10 will finally be available on February 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9Vcfx9L1DnI8TkfJC4_I2BD_mg=/0x240:5760x4080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729700/Echo_Show_10__Glacier_White__Kitchen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzQbvt"&gt;Amazon’s new motorized Echo Show 10 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;announced last fall at its annual hardware event&lt;/a&gt; — finally has a release date of February 25th, with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorders starting today for $249.99&lt;/a&gt;. The smart display was originally announced for a late-2020 release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHM9uk"&gt;Unlike Amazon’s other Echo Show smart displays, the Echo Show 10 has a motorized base that allows the display to swivel around to face you whenever you’re interacting with it. It also uses its rotational abilities (together with digital zooming and panning) to keep users centered in the frame on video calls, even when they’re moving around. Notably, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;supports Zoom&lt;/a&gt; in addition to its own Alexa group calling features, making it a potentially useful tool for videoconferencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uT2mDE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 10 moves to look at you","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HmCbuF"&gt;Similarly, the screen can rotate when playing video from services like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, allowing you to always be able to see your show. The display on the new device can also be manually tilted up and down, although the 10-inch “HD” panel is still largely the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0SL9X"&gt;The Echo Show 10 doesn’t use its camera setup for facial recognition, though. It can tell when someone is talking and face them, but it can’t determine specific people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAlzE0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s shot at Amazon flares monthslong fight over billionaires’ orbital real estate</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Vt8HzeWiNLkiHnDbmPUXu_uK6A=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729618/VRG_ILLO_4389_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9B4Oxc"&gt;The satellite feud between Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon spilled out into the open on social media this week, after brewing for months in meetings with regulators. It’s only the latest spat in a new race among billionaires for a slice of a $1 trillion telecommunications market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PUvuY"&gt;Musk and Bezos, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;the two richest people in the world&lt;/a&gt;, are racing to build vast networks of satellites in low-Earth orbit capable of bringing high-speed broadband internet to rural parts of the world that have little or no access to the internet. SpaceX has 955 satellites in orbit for its Starlink network and plans to launch thousands more, while Amazon’s Kuiper System is in earlier stages of development without any satellites in orbit — yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aqTZj"&gt;The quarrel centers on a filing from last summer, when SpaceX asked Federal Communications Commission officials for approval to change some Starlink satellites to altitudes between 540 and 570 km — close to Amazon’s proposed constellation, which will orbit Earth around a 590 km altitude. SpaceX says the tweak would make it easier to de-orbit old satellites without causing spectrum interference with other satellite operators, but Amazon and other companies beg to differ. They say it would create interference, heighten the risk of satellite collisions, and get in the way of Amazon’s future constellation as approved by the FCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4N9Frp"&gt;“It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation,” Musk tweeted Tuesday, echoing the points made in feisty SpaceX filings posted on Twitter by CNBC reporter Michael Sheetz. In those filings, SpaceX’s director of satellite policy, David Goldman, said “competitors cherry pick data and ignore the true changes in the modification” in order to “reach misleading claims of interference.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ure7WN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354018055014260738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXB7DJ"&gt;Responding to Musk’s tweet, Amazon released a statement saying: “The facts are simple. We designed the Kuiper System to avoid interference with Starlink, and now SpaceX wants to change the design of its system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOq3XA"&gt;“Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX’s proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems,” Amazon said. “It is clearly in SpaceX’s interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public’s interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHD4H8"&gt;The public finger-pointing was an unusual escalation for a kind of industry conflict usually confined to the obscure corners of FCC filing databases. Bezos and Musk’s foray into the world of satellites has generated new excitement — and chaos — for a massive industry filled with incumbents such as SES, Viasat, Intelsat, and others. SpaceX, aiming to invest a total of $10 billion in Starlink, has floated a possibility to investors of splitting the program off into a separate entity sometime in the future and filing an IPO, a prospect that would put Musk’s star power at the helm of another potentially disruptive public company. And despite falling far behind SpaceX, Bezos has pledged to invest $10 billion in Kuiper, cementing its move to compete with both SpaceX and existing satellite internet companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lTwZ3A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you are going to put up and basically claim an entire sphere around the earth, then you’re gonna generate a lot more attention and discussion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pn8rHi"&gt;“If you are going to put up and basically claim an entire sphere around the earth, then you’re gonna generate a lot more attention and discussion,” said Caleb Henry, a senior analyst at satellite research firm Quilty Analytics. “Because everyone has to know how to operate with respect to that layer of satellites that you put.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwsWKe"&gt;Since its first Starlink launch in 2019, SpaceX has lofted over 1,000 satellites to orbit of the roughly 12,000 needed for continuous global coverage.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That deployment pace has been supercharged by Musk’s breakneck push to offer commercial service and start generating revenue to fund SpaceX’s Mars rocket, Starship. In 2018, when development was moving too slow for Musk’s style, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spacex-starlink-insight/musk-shakes-up-spacex-in-race-to-make-satellite-launch-window-sources-idUSKCN1N50FC"&gt;he grew angry and fired seven Starlink managers&lt;/a&gt;, including the program’s top designer and SpaceX’s VP of satellites. Those two managers now lead Amazon’s Kuiper project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqijz5"&gt;Last year, SpaceX began an invite-only beta program that now has thousands of users across the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Its initial price is pegged at $99 a month, plus $499 for a setup kit that includes a pizza-sized dish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCUw4k"&gt;Amazon’s constellation promises a network of 3,236 low-Earth-orbiting satellites. The online retail giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;last month revealed the design&lt;/a&gt; for a phased array antenna that can provide “maximum throughput of up to 400 Mbps,” but it has been largely quiet on its deployment timeline or which rocket it’ll use to put the satellites in orbit. Nonetheless, Amazon is one of a handful of organizations to push back on SpaceX’s rapid Starlink deployment campaign for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHUtTQ"&gt;Satellite broadband firm Viasat joined Amazon last year in asking the FCC to deny SpaceX’s application to move nearly 3,000 Starlink satellites to a lower orbit, saying the Starlink system poses “an unreasonable threat to the continued use of the shared orbital environment.” The company escalated its request in December, calling on the FCC to conduct an environmental assessment of Starlink. And some are concerned that SpaceX’s rush to build and invest in its constellation could make it harder for the FCC to regulate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HyecJT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I built it, now you can’t change it - good policy is never formed that way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKS8Yq"&gt;“I built it, now you can’t change it - good policy is never formed that way,” John Janka, Viasat’s chief officer for global government affairs, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0jGk3"&gt;Since SpaceX began launching its Starlink satellites in batches of 60 atop its Falcon 9 rocket, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21043229/spacex-starlink-satellite-mega-constellation-concerns-astronomy-space-traffic"&gt;astronomy organizations have sounded alarms&lt;/a&gt; over the satellites’ brightness in the night sky: capturing long-exposure telescopic images of the cosmos from Earth are now often tainted by ugly light streaks produced by the bright satellites passing by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH5iGh"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks Starlink satellites on the side, said the proximity between SpaceX’s proposed altitude and Amazon’s future satellites is slightly concerning, “but the majority of what they’re asking doesn’t seem, to me, to be really interfering with the Amazon ones.” A bigger commercial concern is SpaceX planting its flag in prime orbital real estate, where “it’s high enough that you don’t have to be constantly re-boosting the orbit and using a lot of fuel, and low enough that if things go wrong it’ll reenter naturally” in the Earth’s atmosphere — a key FCC requirement for mitigating debris in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15t5Bg"&gt;“The more SpaceX’s satellites are in that altitude range, the less room there is for other companies to later put stuff there,” McDowell said. “The grabbing-up of all the good territory is a reasonable complaint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJglai"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VR success I Expect You to Die is getting a sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="I Expect You To Die 2 logo over a gameplay image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knTLm7BqE0l4FJHhb8yV7ecz8h4=/200x0:1280x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729280/I_Expect_You_To_Die_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZeJSd"&gt;Schell Games is making a sequel to its massively successful virtual reality game &lt;em&gt;I Expect You to Die&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s expected to come out later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtKWod"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.schellgames.com/blog/ieytd2-announcement/"&gt;Along with the announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the studio mentioned the original game earned $6 million in revenue across all VR platforms, which could explain how it can afford to make a sequel. It isn’t yet clear which VR platforms the next game will come to, but it &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1499120/I_Expect_You_To_Die_2/"&gt;will at least arrive on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, which indicates support for Vive, Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Urb4EP"&gt;The original was more or less a spy-themed escape room in VR, and the second one looks like it’ll be more of the same, which isn’t necessarily unwelcome in a world where real-life escape rooms aren’t really accessible during a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TlD7TB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome back, Agents.&lt;br&gt;Ready to get back to work?&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IExpectYouToDie2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#IExpectYouToDie2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/IYifJ4RzTK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IYifJ4RzTK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— I Expect You To Die (@ieytd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ieytd/status/1354462149712736260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wb5ZfT"&gt;So far, most of the early era VR games people would recognize haven’t gotten follow-ups, and that’s doubly true for ones made by indie studios. While &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/lone-echo-2-release-date-further-delayed/"&gt;has a sequel in the works&lt;/a&gt;, the studio behind it &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/facebook-acquires-vr-studio-behind-lone-echo/"&gt;was bought by Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and is now a part of Oculus Studios. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;’s sequel (&lt;em&gt;Vacation Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, of course), was made after &lt;a href="https://owlchemylabs.com/owlchemy-labs-and-google-join-forces/"&gt;the studio behind it was purchased by Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q94OII"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superhot&lt;/em&gt; was super fun when it came to VR, but its sequel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318812/superhot-mind-control-delete-expansion-free-all-owners-first-game"&gt;doesn’t yet support VR play&lt;/a&gt;. I could go on, making a list of VR games that haven’t gotten sequels like &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boneworks&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; (not that it needs one), but you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvokBe"&gt;Hopefully, this sequel announcement speaks to the fact that VR is coming out of a slump. It had a pretty successful 2020, with the release of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;and the Oculus Quest 2, but one year of success doesn’t necessarily indicate a trend. As with all things, content is king, and VR will need to keep having killer releases to gain market share. Obviously, it’s not all on&lt;em&gt; I Expect You to Die 2&lt;/em&gt;’s shoulders, but if it can replicate the success of the original, it could indicate that the VR market is getting back on its feet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This a cappella group is scarily good at imitating Windows sound effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZKrrxnax9c_5nVJOD8wNc2sxxE=/278x0:1634x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729240/windows.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZKeTWR"&gt;If you’ve ever used Windows 10 before, I need you to stop what you’re doing and go listen to this a cappella group’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AZB64VBJfA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;terrifyingly accurate&lt;/a&gt; covers of Windows sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqCCBn"&gt;No Windows noises were spared here. The compilation includes the Windows Vista startup theme (remember that?), the recycle bin crunch, the Windows XP shutdown tones, and more. But the two segments that are unbelievably spot-on are the “USB In” and “USB Out” noises, which come about 10 seconds in. If I closed my eyes, you could convince me they were the real deal. Also, the error message straight-up stresses me out. It’s haunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2Dyhn"&gt;But don’t take my word for it — give the video a watch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pf9QPI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AZB64VBJfA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kGuLD3"&gt;The group behind this video is a Korean band called Maytree. They’ve got a number of other cover videos up on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/maytree_music/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, including an excellent rendition of Ariana Grande’s “Positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHxtjH"&gt;I use Windows 10 every day and experience some of these sound effects constantly — they’ve grown so commonplace that they don’t register when I hear them. When I saw the title of this video, the cynic in me thought “Windows 10 sound effects? Really? Of all the things to cover?” But videos like this are a funny reminder that these operating systems are auditory experiences, too. And there’s a level of intricacy to even the most basic sound effects that’s hugely impressive for a group of human voices to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram made a richer story interface for desktops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAs4S8_H6C9Nqv3TGcCupkqRJRw=/0x0:2720x1813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729073/instagramstories.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XYE6Th"&gt;Instagram is making its Stories feature more complete on the desktop. In a small interface refresh today, the company is updating its Stories feature so that it opens up to show a carousel of videos, which previews what’s cued up next and the content that just played. From this interface, viewers can click on whatever story they want to watch. It’s sort of like if the tiny circles at the top of users’ feeds went bigger and full-screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEKIzz"&gt;This is a minor change, but it rounds out the desktop feature and makes it more appealing to use, especially as people are on their computers more frequently while working from home. For the most part, Instagram has left Stories unchanged for years. The format is the same as always, with posts being ephemeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fzxaf"&gt;Most of Instagram’s changes to the format come in the form of creative tools, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222038/instagram-small-business-sticker-stories-gift-cards-delivery"&gt;stickers for small businesses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1290347300439486464"&gt;new fonts&lt;/a&gt;. For now, Instagram’s firmly focusing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;on Reels&lt;/a&gt;, its TikTok competitor, with Stories receiving small updates to keep it fresh. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The processor is updated. The rest? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kH6i08"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a midrange phone with a flagship name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9QQQa"&gt;Rather than offer essentially the same top-tier phone at different sizes, Samsung has chosen to get aggressive on price this year. The Galaxy S21 starts at $799.99 for the smaller version with a 6.2-inch screen and $999.99 for the Plus version with a 6.7-inch display. Though in both cases, the smart move is to spend an extra $50 for the models with 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zXoV"&gt;It helps that the S21 happens to be a very good midrange phone. Nevertheless, Samsung’s choices this year mean if you want to get the very best phone Samsung has to offer right now, you have to buy the very &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="em9jN5"&gt;If the Ultra is too big or too expensive for your needs, there’s nothing wrong with the regular Galaxy S21. Samsung has managed to cut the price without major sacrifices in either the experience or the features of this phone. However, avoiding massive failure isn’t necessarily the same thing as achieving great success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x6MAv8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10305775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZyXbMNC2UhUwsWa7wUsSa3j4ymE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258903/vpavic_210118_4378_0213.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="U6duVZ"&gt;The phones that aim to give you the best of everything tend to cost more than a thousand dollars. Below that, there are more noticeable trade-offs as each phone picks its priority. For the Galaxy S21, Samsung put its big bet behind just one part: the processor, Qualcomm’s high-end Snapdragon 888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQcPkZ"&gt;In some markets outside the US, Samsung is using its own Exynos processor, and though I’ve heard Samsung has significantly improved it over last year’s, I haven’t been able to test it myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9duJp"&gt;On a basic level, prioritizing the processor means the S21 is a very fast phone with decent battery life. I am able to get through a full day with moderate to heavy use on the 4,000mAh battery, though with a little effort, I can drain it down. The bigger Galaxy S21 Plus — which I haven’t tested — has a 4,800mAh battery and presumably will last even longer despite its slightly larger screen. Both share the same resolution and features otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CArd0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung prioritized putting in a fast new processor above all else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BaaoF"&gt;Just as importantly, the choice to go with the newest and best Qualcomm processor means the Galaxy S21 has a better chance of lasting you three or more years before the inevitable march of Android software bogs it down or leaves it behind. I’ve asked Samsung how many years of software updates it will guarantee for S21 users and will update this review if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hci2fC"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 also means these phones support both kinds of 5G in the US. In my testing in the Bay Area, I still find that 5G often isn’t notably faster than LTE, and the mmWave version of 5G is still very difficult to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC4Rgl"&gt;However, I can also see some improvements over last year. My take on 5G has therefore shifted a bit. I still think that you should not upgrade your phone just to get 5G. However, if you’re due for an upgrade &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt; and you have the choice of getting a 5G phone, you probably should. The networks aren’t good enough yet, but if you’re keeping your phone for a while, you may regret not having it in the years to come. (It’ll be hard to buy a phone without 5G if you’re spending over $500 this year, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6m15bRQ0zZPq-LpOuRYucVqEJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258912/vpavic_210118_4378_0178.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FYZdAW"&gt;To go along with the priority you can’t see, Samsung’s other big change is the thing you can: the design. As with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, the regular Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have metal rails that flow into the camera bump on the back. It looks as good here as it does on the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri1l39"&gt;However, Samsung went a step further on the smaller S21 by swapping out the usual rear glass panel with plastic (the Plus model still uses glass). It’s not a problem for me at all — in fact, in some ways, I prefer it as it’s one less thing that is able to shatter in a fall. It’s a way to cut costs, but one that makes me wonder whether I really want glass on the back of my phone in the first place. It feels great, with a matte finish and none of the cheap or flimsy associations plastic can bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s screen is only 1080p, but it’s flat and looks great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6VFHY1LDByk6XWrM61fGMp0iMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258895/vpavic_210119_4378_0238.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are three cameras on the back of the S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHnAtkSkPbgdAwQ2MqqUqDLYrF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258897/vpavic_210119_4378_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three cameras on the back of the S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKrLXB"&gt;While we’re on the subject, here are some of the other ways Samsung has cut costs on the S21 compared to last year’s Galaxy S20. It lacks MST, Samsung’s tech for paying at credit card terminals that can’t read NFC. There is no microSD card slot for expanding the storage, which stings a bit as Samsung was a bit of a holdout in keeping the microSD card around in its flagships until recently. Samsung also saved costs by standing pat with the cameras — they’re virtually unchanged from last year. (More on the cameras below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAqGCX"&gt;The S21 also drops the screen resolution down from last year’s 1440p panel to 1080p on both the regular and Plus versions. They’re flat, too, which many people prefer to curved edges. I don’t mind curved screens so long as they fit with the ergonomics of the phone, but here, I think Samsung made the right call to go flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp1mQ5"&gt;The screen has an adaptive refresh rate that can run at up to 120Hz, so scrolling and animations are very smooth. Unlike the Ultra’s more advanced screen technology, this screen’s refresh rate bottoms out at 48Hz, and it also uses more traditional OLED tech instead of the newer LTPO version in the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jan4WZ"&gt;To those screen spec downgrades, I say this: whatever. Samsung is consistently great at making screens, and even though the S21 doesn’t showcase the company at its best, it’s still a great display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3BVXO"&gt;But more than any other upgrade or downgrade this year, the spec that had the most tangible effect on my experience with the S21 was the new fingerprint sensor under the screen. It can read from a larger area, and to me, it feels faster than last year’s sensor did. For as often as we unlock our phones, even milliseconds make a difference in how responsive the phone feels. Also: it works with masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldH3g-82fT_EWqT4iskr_P52nFo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258892/vpavic_210122_4378_0249.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Zphw1m"&gt;The only substantive difference between the camera systems on last year’s Galaxy S20 and this year’s Galaxy S21 isn’t in the hardware, but the software. Samsung has done some work to update its processing to improve photos in certain situations. I’ve noticed a small jump in low-light quality, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesJXT"&gt;But outside a minor sensor swap on the ultrawide, the camera hardware is unchanged. The main sensor is 12 megapixels with OIS, the ultrawide is also 12 megapixels and has a 120-degree field of view, and the telephoto has a 3x optical zoom and does crop tricks with its 30-megapixel sensor to offer digital zoom up to 30X. The selfie camera is 10 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWFqPT"&gt;In the US, I think the most direct camera competitor in this price range is probably the $699 Google Pixel 5. Much to my surprise, the consensus among reviewers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is that the Galaxy S21 takes better photos overall. I agree. The Pixel’s long-standing camera advantage has all but dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IE4UjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10305812"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXtk4E"&gt;Now, I still prefer the Pixel’s aesthetics to Samsung’s. The Pixel keeps its contrast-y, bluer look compared to Samsung’s tendency to over-brighten and oversaturate everything. However, on a technical level, the Galaxy S21 just does a better job. There’s less noise in shadows and low light, more detail in decent light, and much better zoom performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbSmBB"&gt;Don’t think the regular Galaxy S21 stands up to the superior telephoto images you can get from the Ultra, which has a 10X optical lens. But at zoom levels from 3X to the Pixel’s maximum of 7X, the S21 simply does a better job than Google’s algorithms. Samsung also wins on video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Szqb2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10305816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yGvL4"&gt;There is the usual array of new camera features, many of which I think most users can ignore. Shooting 8K video doesn’t make much sense on a camera of this caliber, but you can do it. I do appreciate Samsung’s Pro modes for both video and photos, though. In situations where you’re able to spend a little time composing your shot and adjusting the camera settings, you can get something much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlgR6d"&gt;Samsung has also made it possible to turn off face smoothing completely. It makes for better images, but more importantly, it might also help &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497587/google-pixel-phone-selfie-beauty-filter-retouching-camera"&gt;make for a better self-image&lt;/a&gt; for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fzsUmpelPMwTxNytg_CUH6t3GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258901/vpavic_210119_4378_0228.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="X9ND6z"&gt;As I noted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;in my review of the Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is heading in the wrong direction with its software. It’s a shame because the fundamentals of Samsung’s version of Android, One UI, are still great. It makes Android feel a little cleaner and brighter and gives it key features to help manage gigantic screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Iz3Go"&gt;But instead of building on that strength, Samsung is bogging it down. There are too many arcane settings and too many nearly meaningless icons in the quick settings panel. In the US, S21 users will have to be savvy enough to know to download and use Android Messages instead of Samsung Messages if they want unfettered, unbroken access to RCS messaging (most of the rest of the world gets Android Messages by default). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q0JNaz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One UI still has the right fundamentals but is heading in the wrong direction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ziztFW"&gt;Also, Samsung’s digital assistant, Bixby, is only worth using if you’ve connected the rest of your digital life to Samsung’s ecosystem. I suspect most in the US have not, and so the whole thing just seems redundant next to Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxUqcd"&gt;Most egregiously of all, Samsung’s default apps often have ads at the top. Tapping the gigantic weather widget at the top of the default home screen reveals an ad in Samsung’s weather app. I don’t know what tiny marginal profit Samsung makes from these ads, but I don’t think the hit to its reputation is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5xTyl"&gt;All of these hassles with Samsung’s software can either be avoided or undone by a knowledgeable user. And in general, I think most users will find their way to that knowledge — but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a hassle in the first place. I can be more productive on a well-configured Samsung phone than on virtually any other phone, but it shouldn’t require this much configuration and ad-dodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuDtdwJTwbMBxwvpw_1cGz7AwFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t8u2Le"&gt;Add up all of the choices and components in the Galaxy S21, and you can’t avoid the conclusion that it is a rehashed Galaxy S20 with a faster processor and a nicer exterior. That’s a fairly dour way of looking at it, but it is the truth, and I don’t think it should damn the phone. Sometimes the year-over-year updates are minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSqdNI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung brought the price down, but you should wait for carriers to discount it even further&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qF1o2d"&gt;That minor update means there’s little reason to rush out to buy the Galaxy S21. It’s a phone to get when you need to replace your old and busted phone, and if your phone is more than a couple of years old, it’ll make a huge difference. There’s another reason not to rush out to get the S21: Samsung’s phones are famous for getting deep discounts from carriers. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it would be a mistake to pay full price for an S21, but I would say you should look — or even wait — for a deal if you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MnS8u"&gt;The most interesting choice Samsung made this year is instead of making a lower-cost “Fan Edition” of its flagship phone, it just made that flagship the lower-cost version. That’s a reasonable choice for Samsung to make, but it also means that you as a consumer have one less choice. Once again, if you want Samsung’s very best phone this year, you’re going to have to buy Samsung’s biggest phone — and this year, the differences are even more stark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iFdWeP"&gt;But if you’re not interested in the latest, greatest, and biggest, and you don’t mind the way Samsung handles Android, the Galaxy S21 is a fine choice.&lt;/p&gt;
