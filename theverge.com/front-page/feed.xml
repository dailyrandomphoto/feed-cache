    <title>Canon’s $5,999 EOS R3 focuses by tracking your eye</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_m8Ey3eFpWJBAj0xucJSJtt-hI=/0x5:1750x1172/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855323/HR_EOS_R3_4_CL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2y8qO6"&gt;Canon confirmed plans for its highest-end mirrorless camera yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383187/canon-eos-r3-mirrorless-camera-development-announced"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt;, but that was just a notice of development — now the company is ready to announce its specs in full. As expected, the EOS R3 will sit right at the top of the company’s still fairly new EOS R range of full-frame mirrorless cameras, above last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;R5 and R6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NxcnO"&gt;The 24-megapixel stacked BSI sensor is lower resolution than the 45-megapixel R5’s, but the R3 is all about high speed, fast AF performance, and low light capability. Canon says it can shoot at up to 30fps with the electronic shutter and 12fps with the mechanical shutter, and the maximum native ISO is 102,400. As for video, the R3 can shoot 6K at 60fps and uncropped 10-bit 4K at 120fps in the Canon Log 3 profile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUxDi_c_ju3WaVmt2ieAFGjdDrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849228/HR_EOS_R3_7_CL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xUJMZp"&gt;The R3 makes use of deep learning technology to improve eye and body detection and autofocus, according to Canon, and photographers can select an initial AF point with eye tracking just by looking at an area of the 5.76-million-dot electronic viewfinder. The R3 has 1,053 AF points in total, though Canon isn’t saying quite how granular the eye-input system gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8knyi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVstWLb-flM"&gt;YouTube’s CVP channel&lt;/a&gt; provides a good demonstration of the new eye controlled AF point selection, noting that it uses low-powered IR LEDs inside the viewfinder to scan where the eyes are looking. It calls the tech “hit and miss” for different users, that makes focusing “pretty simple” when it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Sxw8xp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVstWLb-flM?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=365&amp;amp;start=365" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNMrBl"&gt;As previously revealed, the R3 looks quite similar to the EOS-1D X Mark III, which essentially occupies the same place in Canon’s DSLR lineup. It uses a one-piece magnesium alloy design with a built-in vertical grip, and Canon says it has equivalent weather and dust resistance to the EOS-1D DSLRs. The body has wired LAN, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB-C built-in, as well as one CFexpress card slot and one UHS-II SD card slot. There’s also a vari-angle 3.2-inch LCD screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jvovvjdb0-kEOnhcQlbky0Ir9Ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849229/HR_EOS_R3_9_CL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7oHGEo"&gt;The EOS R3 will be available in November for $5,999,99. Canon is also introducing two new relatively affordable lenses for the EOS R system: a $299.99 16mm f/2.8 compact ultrawide prime and a $649.99 100-400mm f/5.6-8 telephoto zoom. Both of those will go on sale at some point next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkBPAO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 14th, 6:20AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added video demonstration of &lt;/em&gt;eye controlled AF point selection.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon One’s palm-scanning tech makes first move into entertainment venues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6YVOIPCGcxtUNuVeD_T5pL613k=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855299/amazon_one_palm_scan_stadium.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NH6rb1"&gt;Amazon’s palm-scanning technology, Amazon One, has always been about more than just fast payments. Really, it’s about Amazon controlling and verifying identities, with the company hoping to deploy its service in public spaces like offices and stadiums. Today, Amazon announced the tech’s &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-one-expands-beyond-retail-with-first-third-party-customer-ticketing-company-axs"&gt;first launch in an entertainment venue&lt;/a&gt; as part of a partnership with ticketing firm AXS. Amazon One will be available to validate entry into Colorado’s famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre, an open-air venue built into a rocky outcrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir05XX"&gt;It’s the first time the technology has been deployed outside Amazon and Whole Food stores, and Amazon says it expects the tech will be added “to more AXS ticketed venues in the future.” People can enroll into the scheme at dedicated stations in the Red Rocks venue, with these booths analyzing the unique patterns of veins and lines in their palms to register and then later verify identities. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Umphreys McGee In Concert At Red Rocks Amphitheatre" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3DaeK74GOItocA9czZ5vXvXCsec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849247/1233572032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre has been home to many notable events and concerts. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rzoLrj"&gt;Amazon is trying to make the case that this technology is more convenient than regular contactless cards and QR codes, but it’s not that convincing. It’s true that you can’t &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; your palm in a way you might lose a physical ticket, but most tickets are available on our phones these days, which we tend to have with us all the time. Numerous privacy experts, meanwhile, have expressed skepticism about Amazon’s ambitions here. The company is not likely to make money from Amazon One, so instead it must be interested in the data it can collect. If Amazon One becomes standard use in physical stores and venues, then the company will get better insight into customers shopping habits and hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEWzkX"&gt;Right now, though, there doesn’t seem to be a huge amount of momentum behind the technology. It’s been out a year and Amazon says that “tens of thousands of customers have signed up and used the service to enter and pay at participating Amazon stores” only. The company is also trying to encourage sign-ups by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607218/amazon-one-palm-print-technology-10-dollar-promo"&gt;offering $10 for your palm print&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest monitor has a pop-up webcam with Windows Hello support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Q77jZ55W1dKr0YEdVSiwbw_gco=/1x0:1335x889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855297/S40VA_3_274023_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Hello support lets you log in to Windows with just your face.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Msww1G"&gt;Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsungs-first-webcam-monitor-hybrid-workers-available-for-purchase-now/"&gt;Webcam Monitor S4&lt;/a&gt; comes with all the work-from-home accessories you could need built right in. It’s got 2W stereo speakers for listening to colleagues, an HD webcam so they can see you, a microphone so they can hear you, and a USB hub to cut down on the amount of ports needed on a laptop or desktop. The monitor is available now, &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsungs-first-webcam-monitor-hybrid-workers-available-for-purchase-now/"&gt;Samsung says&lt;/a&gt;, and costs $319.99 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pR1hqv"&gt;The 24-inch, 1080p monitor’s built-in webcam is neatly integrated, with a pop-up design that keeps things looking tidy when you’re not on video calls. As a bonus, the design doubles as a privacy shutter for the webcam to help prevent accidental (or malicious) appearances on camera. It’s not automated like on many phones. Instead, the webcam is revealed by “pushing it down into the monitor to make it spring up,” Samsung says. The webcam is Windows Hello certified, meaning it can scan faces to allow quick logins to apps, websites, and Windows itself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p0NJ_wOjruSdHWlW5nhlDIu2ItI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849236/S24A40_003_Front_Black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam hides away when not in use. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9CDDIx"&gt;Rounding out the specs is a stand that’s height-adjustable, and which can be tilted, swivelled, and pivoted. The monitor is also VESA compatible to let it work with monitor arms or other stands. Ports include HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2, and its refresh rate tops out at 75Hz. As well as the US, the Webcam Monitor S4 is also releasing in Europe, South Korea, and South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is once more accepting requests for verification </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/US853X9KvYziL1fTWeija3TJnGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855269/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nL6qXJ"&gt;Kick the football, Charlie Brown! You’ll &lt;a href="https://peanuts.fandom.com/wiki/Football_gag"&gt;definitely get it this time&lt;/a&gt;! And while you’re at it, why not apply to be verified on Twitter? There’s no way that can go wrong either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gza9nw"&gt;The news: after temporarily halting new applications for its revamped verification process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623714/twitter-verification-program-pause-fake-accounts-review"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1437533358746218496"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s “back to rolling out access to request a blue badge.” The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1436435172912676865"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it put a pause on new applications in order to improve “the application flow and review process.” That may have something to do with the fake accounts that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;accidentally verified&lt;/a&gt; in July, but maybe Twitter has now learned from its mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3kgWVE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re back to rolling out access to request a blue badge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re planning to apply and don’t yet have access, keep checking your account settings. Thanks for sticking with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Verified (@verified) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1437533358746218496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8FvItF"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;relaunched&lt;/a&gt; its perennially troubled verification program in May this year, after it was put on ice in 2017. Twitter’s criteria for verification is that an account must be “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;authentic, notable, and active&lt;/a&gt;,” but the public perception of verification has always been a little more ambiguous, stirring up controversy around the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qry9u"&gt;For a start, there are numerous cases of genuinely notable and influential figures going unverified, while podunk journalists like myself can saunter up to the verification table and grab a badge no questions. Some users, meanwhile, see verification mostly as a prestige item, indicating that verified individuals are somehow better than the mass of gelatinous pond scum that constitutes the &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;verified (I’m not saying that’s wrong, exactly) and so want to be verified just for the sake of it. Others see it as a mark of reliability, rather than simply notoriety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnnnO8"&gt;Trying to keep everyone happy has been difficult for Twitter, but its stop-start, uncoordinated approach to the whole business is hardly helping. For example, even though Twitter &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; users can apply for verification again, its FAQ page still &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;clearly states&lt;/a&gt; “There is no way to apply for verification today” (and seems not to have been updated since the beginning of the year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kye7me"&gt;Anyway, maybe this time Twitter will sort out this mess for real. And maybe Charlie Brown will finally kick that football. Stranger things have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google found guilty of restricting Android forks in South Korea, fined $177 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/otBykqjvq2O1r-vdtRFyZAXsq3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855227/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7RlGSS"&gt;Google has been fined 207.4 billion won (around $177 million) in South Korea for abusing its dominant market position to stop device manufacturers from using modified versions of Android, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/south-korea-fines-google-for-abusing-smartphone-dominance?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) is taking issue with the anti-fragmentation agreements (AFA) Google has manufacturers like Samsung sign, which prevents it from making changes to the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9ohw8"&gt;The ruling prohibits Google from forcing manufacturers to sign these AFAs, and will also require it to modify existing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz1CZQ"&gt;The regulator is concerned that restricting these forks to the OS has prevented the emergence of viable competitors to Android from the likes of Amazon and Alibaba. Android is currently the world’s most popular mobile operating system, and is installed on over 80 percent of smartphones globally. Although the core of Android is open-source, manufacturers have to sign an AFA to get benefits like early access to the operating system as well as access to the Google Play Store, an essential part of the Android experience for most smartphone users, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/south-korea-antitrust-regulator-fines-google-177-million.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ypIHS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google intends to appeal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zjYeG7"&gt;“The Korea Fair Trade Commission’s decision is meaningful in a way that it provides an opportunity to restore future competitive pressure in the mobile OS and app market markets,” said KFTC chairperson Joh Sung-wook in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorean-antitrust-agency-fines-google-177-mln-abusing-market-dominance-2021-09-14/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The fine could be the ninth largest the regulator has ever issued, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdVW0o"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson from Google &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/south-korea-antitrust-regulator-fines-google-177-million.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company disagreed with the ruling, and argued that Android’s policies had allowed Korean phone manufacturers and developers to be successful, and had created opportunities for innovation. “The KFTC’s decision released today ignores these benefits, and will undermine the advantages enjoyed by consumers,” the spokesperson said, adding that Google plans to appeal the ruling. Google has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-has-helped-create-more-choice/"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; that its AFAs are necessary to ensure that apps work across more Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lCgPu"&gt;In addition to smartphones, Android is used on devices like smartwatches and smart TVs. Korea’s regulator said that today’s ruling also applies to these other categories. “Corrective measures included emerging smart device-related areas such as smartwatches and smart TVs,” Chairperson Joh Sung-wook said in comments reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqjS3"&gt;The ruling comes on the same day as the so-called “anti-Google law” goes into force in South Korea. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;new law&lt;/a&gt; requires major platform owners like Google and Apple to allow developers to use third-party payment systems in their apps. Both companies had previously required developers to use only the built-in payment processes for in-app purchases, which in most cases results in Apple and Google collecting a 30 percent cut of transactions. Similarly, a US judge ruled last week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Apple can’t stop developers&lt;/a&gt; from linking to other payment methods as a result of legal action brought by Epic Games. The decision on Epic v. Google is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuuebI"&gt;As well as Google’s anti-fragmentation agreements, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Korean regulator is also investigating alleged competition restrictions in Google’s Play Store app market, in-app purchases, and the ad market. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrZQc_LAoT9-GSZoKVWPtpYeWP8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855140/g435hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PC/PlayStation headset that uses beamforming mics instead of a boom mic.&lt;/em&gt; | Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="os91UD"&gt;Many of Logitech’s previous wireless gaming headsets cost more than $100, but its latest is a relative bargain without compromising too much on comfort or features. The G435 Lightspeed costs $80, comes in three colorways, and can connect wirelessly to a PC or PlayStation console via its USB dongle, and to a phone, tablet, or other devices via a low-latency Bluetooth connection (Logitech didn’t share specific millisecond latency specs in time for publication). The headset will be available sometime in September 2021 from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FLogitechG.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22665355%2Flogitech-g435-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebxt3D"&gt;Its design picks up where the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21378026/logitech-g733-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-accessories-g203-g305-g915-colors"&gt;G733 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; left off, with lots of color, breathable mesh fabric, and plastic all around. There are some differences, both cosmetic and functional. Logitech says the G435 Lightspeed was designed primarily for smaller heads, as it’s angling this model to a younger generation. Though, it still fits my large-sized head easily. The ear cups are on rails that allow for easy adjustment, whether you want to make them fit a bigger or smaller head.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rg3LVNmrhXX4AVBxNK0J5yhkN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839633/g435black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the buttons are on the left ear cup. From top to bottom, there’s the power button, volume up / down, the mute on the bottom. Holding mute toggles between 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NhbMB2"&gt;The G435 Lightspeed looks like a traditional wireless gaming headset, except for one major omission: a boom microphone. That’s not to say it doesn’t have a mic at all. Instead of having a physical mic, Logitech employed dual beamforming microphones built into the left earcup that aim to achieve similar results without having a mic right in front of your mouth. During my week of testing, it did a good job picking up my voice and leaving out the sound from my noisy window air conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM2e62"&gt;This may be the lightest gaming headset that I’ve worn yet, weighing 165 grams. The frame and headband are mostly plastic throughout, but Logitech nailed two important aspects about fit: making sure the headset doesn’t feel like it’s weighing down on your head or clamping around your ears too hard. Impressively, there’s barely any cushioning around the headband, just a thin piece of breathable fabric wrapped around it. Yet, there were no issues regarding comfort during my time with the G435. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6y5rgyAFCxIopPLISwvn1Nk8t8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839639/g435blue.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blue and pink colorway shown here is the most vibrant option available for the G435.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zC5y7u"&gt;It’s understandable that for $80 the G435’s build materials might come into question. And yes, with the headset in hand, it feels well-constructed but a little on the chintzy side. To Logitech’s credit, the sound quality is quite a bit better than I expected from a headset at this price, to the point where I didn’t really care about any quibbles I had with the build materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x713Y3"&gt;Rounding up a few more specs, this model charges via USB-C and claims to reach up to 18 hours of battery life per charge. To switch between getting audio from the included USB dongle and Bluetooth, the G435 requires you to manually swap sources by holding the mute button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiNI1E"&gt;If you’re in the market for an affordable wireless gaming headset, the number of options worth checking out is growing, thankfully. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android"&gt;Razer Barracuda X&lt;/a&gt; launching for $100, and this model coming in at $80, it’s easier now to find a console-friendly headset that won’t break the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi shows off concept smart glasses with MicroLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlLevqZCaH7sItrH6DbunnggfcQ=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855085/_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osgDd9"&gt;Xiaomi has announced a pair of smart glasses called Xiaomi Smart Glasses. A company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there’s no plan to actually put them on sale, but Xiaomi has provided enough detail to make the concept product seem somewhat plausible — at least for some point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIuBiE"&gt;Xiaomi’s glasses have a relatively conventional form factor, but unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Facebook and Ray Ban’s just-announced Stories glasses&lt;/a&gt;, they actually do have a display that can be used for AR features. Xiaomi says it went with a monochrome MicroLED system because of its “higher pixel density and longer lifespan while having a simpler structure” when compared to OLED. According to Xiaomi, MicroLED “allows for a more compact display, as well as easier screen integration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSTCwS"&gt;MicroLED is a self-emissive display technology that is widely viewed as the natural successor to OLED. However, it remains prohibitively expensive and is yet to be deployed in more than a handful of commercial products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVsO9egW8M7X5pnQ5DzBu-aa9bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849119/WX20210914_095340.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XqJOjA"&gt;Xiaomi’s display is “roughly the size of a grain of rice” at 2.4mm x 2.02mm and has a peak brightness of 2 million nits. The light won’t be that bright once it actually reaches your eye, of course — the extreme brightness is so it can still be visible in direct sunlight after passing through an optical waveguide lens, which refracts and directs the light. Xiaomi cites use cases like navigation, live translation, and notifications for the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sykuZE"&gt;The glasses themselves are an independent Android device that don’t require a constant phone connection — Xiaomi suggests they could even replace your phone someday. There’s an unspecified quad-core Arm processor, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules, a battery, and a five-megapixel camera on board. Xiaomi says the glasses weigh just 51 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C92kDP"&gt;As mentioned upfront, these glasses aren’t going to be available to the public and may not actually even exist, so you should view Xiaomi’s claims with skepticism. However, coming after Facebook’s announcement and right before Apple’s iPhone event, the concept demonstration is a clear indicator that Xiaomi wants to be considered as a player in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter won’t act on Nicki Minaj tweet irresponsibly linking COVID-19 vaccine to impotency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - February 12, 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hb83PdS5sTas-9Pq4lhtZWp_Kic=/0x0:3054x2036/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854588/1205847816.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Pierre Suu/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPFRTJ"&gt;Twitter has committed to labeling tweets containing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307919/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-labels-five-strike-system"&gt;misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, but the company says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437532566945341441"&gt;a recent Nicki Minaj tweet&lt;/a&gt; which claimed that “the vaccine” made her cousin’s friend impotent does not violate its rules. There is no known scientific evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause a fertility problem in men or women; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html"&gt;the CDC dedicates an entire page to debunking those fears&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPACMB"&gt;“My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it &amp;amp; became impotent,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437532566945341441"&gt;Minaj tweeted&lt;/a&gt; to her 22.6 million followers. “His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it &amp;amp; make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision, not bullied.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3kfXU8396KIYpEQUg5e_M9uwoXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848714/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_6.09.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweet by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437532566945341441" target="_blank"&gt;Nicki Minaj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H4yFv3"&gt;While Minaj clearly suggests her followers should consider their decision to get the vaccine based on this information, it’s unclear whether any doctor traced her cousin’s friend’s condition back to a vaccine as the culprit or saw a larger pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZiLMU"&gt;When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Twitter spokesperson wrote “the Tweets you referenced are not in violation of the Twitter Rules.” While we only asked about a single tweet, Minaj has posted many tweets Monday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437526877808128000"&gt;discussing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437539494664626177"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437543611717931009"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. In one, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437534182117306368"&gt;she noted&lt;/a&gt; that “I’m sure I’ll b vaccinated” because of her need to tour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Q0M51iaG0o-drGknDB0GqEOmE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848719/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_6.11.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweet by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437534182117306368" target="_blank"&gt;Nicki Minaj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmOBN4"&gt;Twitter has a number of functions in place intended to prevent the spread of COVID misinformation on the platform. In August, it launched a new feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629097/twitter-misinformation-health-covid19-reporting-feature-white-house"&gt;to let people report COVID misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eObzIG"&gt;Minaj’s tweet currently carries no label pointing to scientific information about the COVID-19 vaccine, but people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;in Twitter’s Birdwatch program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users fact-check tweets, have left over a dozen notes on the tweet about how the tweet is potentially misleading. However, Birdwatch is still in a limited pilot right now, meaning the significant majority of Twitter users can’t see those fact checks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is rolling out an Android 12 beta to Galaxy S21 owners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="One UI 4 on the Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gIQ6byUp17YH8jnX69KydrKCeE4=/318x0:3695x2251/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854576/01_one_ui_4_beta_press_release_widget_customization.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One UI 4 on the Galaxy S21 | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fOUTTz"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/3nsjCz3"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s rolling out a public beta of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; for Galaxy S21 devices, just a few weeks ahead of when we expect the final OS to be officially available for the first time on Pixel phones. Samsung is touting that it is managing to get these betas out earlier every year, though this year it’s only by a week or two compared to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQcmPH"&gt;Registration for the beta program will begin on September 14th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;the same day the iPhone 13 is announced&lt;/a&gt;. Users will need to register in the Samsung Members app to try it — and if Samsung repeats the past, the number of open slots will be limited. It’s only available in the U.S. as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARP3na"&gt;The beta is actually for Samsung’s One UI 4, its version of Android. That distinction is important because one of the major changes in Android 12 is how different it looks. On a Pixel phone, all the buttons are big and the colors change dynamically based on your wallpaper, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;a style Google’s calling “Material You.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="One UI 4 privacy settings and notifications" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Bbv0lK_QeX7Yk6u3HQW1r1-OHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848663/oneui4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;One UI 4 privacy settings and notifications&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LQ6w9B"&gt;On a Galaxy S21 phone, we don’t yet know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how much of Google’s design language Samsung intends to use.  One UI already had lots of theming options — and Samsung’s store was chock full of more users could buy (though most are fairly garish). Sure enough, Samsungs rundown of what’s new in One UI 4 specifically calls out “theme options.” Here is Samsung’s official list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9WAc"&gt;A wealth of theme options let you adjust the look and functionality of your device, giving you tools to configure your home screen, icons, notifications, wallpapers and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPR0O9"&gt;Redesigned, upgraded widgets offer deep customization — from visibility to appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJG6A3"&gt;You also get convenient access to a more robust and diverse array of emojis all in one place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WdwpsT"&gt;Samsung also is adopting Android 12’s visual indicators for when the microphone and camera are in use. It will also have toggles for turning those sensors off completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUwi8z"&gt;New widgets will also be welcome — most of them across most versions of Android have begun feeling a little antiquated. As you can see at the top of this post, Samsung’s widgets look clean, at least, and have big rounded corners. They don’t go quite as far as Google’s new widgets, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAA0mc"&gt;As Google itself becomes more opinionated on what Android looks like on its Pixel phones with Material You, a big question will be whether those opinions work well on non-Google phones. Samsung itself has been moving in a relatively coherent aesthetic direction for the last few years, but it’s been one that uses more white space and larger fonts than Google’s recent designs. We can see that Samsung is adopting some of the bigger, bubbly rounded corners for notifications, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpcY5l"&gt;Are the two looks compatible? Will Google widgets look out of place on a Samsung homescreen? Will Samsung adopt the new locations for various Android system functions that have been moved? Galaxy S21 owners will find out soon enough as they dig deeper into the pubic beta.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 on the Pixel 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P90YgdXDdWW1P3VSYbBXQhVEW_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520874/1._Android_12_Keyword_Header.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart on a rocky year for the app </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syZjy923Th1ut4wxrXyxigbcOik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854535/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A candid Q&amp;amp;A on encryption, privacy, and ProPublica&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Nva9NY"&gt;It has been a contentious year for WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEuuUt"&gt;In January, a simple effort to update its terms of service to enable some commerce features &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/inside-the-whatsapp-privacy-freakout"&gt;triggered a massive backlash in India&lt;/a&gt;, helping its rival Signal to &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/-the-battle-inside-signal"&gt;double its user base in a month&lt;/a&gt;. In May, the Facebook-owned messaging app sued India over new rules issued by the country’s IT ministry that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-whatsapp-sues-india-govt-says-new-media-rules-mean-end-privacy-sources-2021-05-26/"&gt;could break end-to-end encryption around the globe&lt;/a&gt;. And just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users"&gt;a widely read report in &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drew attention to the service’s use of human reviewers to investigate potential violations of WhatsApp’s terms of service, in part by reading the five most recent messages in any reported exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10ezgU"&gt;Writing about &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s story, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-propublicas-investigation-into"&gt;I took exception to the idea&lt;/a&gt; that allowing users to report bad actors is necessarily bad for privacy. (After publication, &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; added an editor’s note saying it had altered some language in the story to clarify that a user reporting feature does not break encryption.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjdD0O"&gt;A few days later, the company announced the introduction of a way to let you encrypt a backup of your WhatsApp messages, preventing anyone who doesn’t have your encryption key (or, alternatively, a password that you set) from reading the contents of any of your messages. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Alex Heath has a nice technical overview of&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22665968/whatsapp-backups-end-to-end-encryption-ios-android"&gt; how this works&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="F7ZUAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WhatsApp is adding encrypted backups","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22665968/whatsapp-backups-end-to-end-encryption-ios-android"},{"title":"WhatsApp sues Indian government over new rules it says break encryption","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SX2seI"&gt;All these issues are the purview of Will Cathcart, who took over WhatsApp in March 2019. Cathcart, who joined parent company Facebook in 2010 after a stint at Google, previously oversaw Facebook’s almighty News Feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlKOMw"&gt;The jobs are very different, but both have involved high-stakes global political battles about speech and democracy. On Monday morning, I caught up with Cathcart over Zoom about privacy, encryption, and the future of messaging. I also asked him if he ever wished he had an easier job. “I love my job,” he assured me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afb8zL"&gt;Highlights of our conversation follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ul2K9v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBoXrc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casey Newton: On Friday you announced that WhatsApp is introducing encrypted backups for its users on Android and iOS. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llF0Gf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Cathcart&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re always focused on what we can do to protect the privacy of people’s messages. People’s messages are very sensitive. And the reality is that over time there are growing threats to people’s privacy — hackers, hostile governments, criminals. And so we’re always looking at how can we add more privacy, especially around the theme of protecting what you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQPpNE"&gt;We’ve had end-to-end encryption for five years, which means if you send a message to someone on WhatsApp, we can’t see what you sent as it passes through all of our servers. It’s completely secure. We think that’s really important. But the reality is there’s other things we can do to protect people’s messages. One is to actually help people’s messages not live forever. We launched disappearing messages late last year, because when I talk to you in person, we don’t usually keep a transcript of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWyGLB"&gt;Another area we’ve been looking at for a while is backups. Many people don’t back up their messages, but a lot of people do. And you can opt into backup on Google or iCloud if you have an Android or an iPhone. We wanted to see if we could find a way to add the same level of end-to-end encrypted security that you get when you send a message across WhatsApp to those backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEd9WW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you do it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tYE3o"&gt;That is a hard problem, because if you back up your message in a truly end-to-end encrypted way, you have to have a password for it, and if you lose your password or your phone, you really have no way to get them back. We don’t have some way to help you if you lose them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cueO6a"&gt;So what we took a long time figuring out how to do was, how can we do this in a way that we felt would be accessible such that a lot of people would be able to use it? And what we’ve come up with is there’s two options you can choose. One is you can keep a 64-digit key, and you can keep that yourself — you can print it out, you can write it down, or you can try to remember it, but I wouldn’t recommend it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIGsjd"&gt;Or if that’s too intimidating or too hard, which we think it will be for a lot of people, we’ve come up with a system where we’ll store the key for you using hardware security modules, which means we don’t have a way to access it. And you can come up with a shorter, easier-to-remember passphrase to get access to it. And that I think will help make this more accessible for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y23E0f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you mentioned, in recent years we’ve seen stories about state-sponsored hackers attempting to access the WhatsApp messages of government officials, diplomats, activists, journalists, and human rights activists, among others. Are backups part of that story? Are they in the threat model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxKOwA"&gt;Yes, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8CHt7"&gt;In some of the stories around&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cyber-whatsapp-nsogroup/whatsapp-sues-israels-nso-for-allegedly-helping-spies-hack-phones-around-the-world-idUSKBN1X82BE"&gt; spyware companies&lt;/a&gt;, the most worrying version of this is where they get full access to your phone. But it’s absolutely a threat that people could try to get access to your backups. There was just&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-23/icloud-photo-theft-nude-women"&gt; a story in the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago about a predator who was using social engineering get access to women’s backups just to try to look through their photos. There was some horrifying number of people affected by that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl5HC9"&gt;The reality is, people have really sensitive stuff in what they say and what they send. We think we’ve got to look at all the ways that there could be a threat to them, and if in any case we can find an interesting or novel way to protect it, add it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J48Jb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So on one hand, WhatsApp now offers a stronger degree of protection to users here than some other encrypted messengers, like Apple’s iMessage, which doesn’t encrypt its backups. But WhatsApp came in for criticism last week over the fact that it allows users to report each other, and to include recent messages in the reports they submit. And those reports — and messages — are reviewed by humans. How did that system come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iL6Iqj"&gt;We’ve had the ability for people to report for a long time. And look, we just disagree with the criticism here. If you and I have a private conversation, that’s private — [but] that doesn’t mean you don’t have the right to go complain to someone if I say something harassing, offensive, or dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OcDCtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Encryption] doesn’t mean you don’t have the right to go complain to someone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="84gNJ9"&gt;That’s how the real world works: in the real world, two people can have a private conversation and then one of them can go ask for help and relay what they were told if they need to. I just think that matches how normal people communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQSJ19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like here we’ve really hit on how “privacy” seems to be a word that is understood differently by every person using it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csdneE"&gt;For what it’s worth, in this area — I haven’t heard people who use WhatsApp tell me they think the idea that we let people report is a problem. I do think there’s some really hard questions around privacy and technology and where are the lines, and things like that. But this one isn’t something I’ve seen actual people who use WhatsApp have a lot of concern about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwXAdp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the ways that you feel that user reporting benefits WhatsApp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5P4yeu"&gt;The clearest high-level way it benefits us is that it helps us run the service with reduced amounts of spam. This is a service with 2 billion users. That is a big global system. Unfortunately, there are going to be some people who are going to try to abuse it — send out spam, send out phishing messages, send out things that are trying to make the experience for people less safe. And the fact that people can report is one of the most powerful techniques we have to catch that stuff. We’re able to ban millions of accounts a month based on [those reports].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPxduc"&gt;Again, we can’t see the messages people send, but we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see when someone reports to us. We think it’s okay for you to report a spammer. And then we can use that to ban people and help keep the service more safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLflyE"&gt;And then there’s other, more rare but very meaningful problems to try to work on — for example, the sharing of child exploitative imagery. We think we’ve found a way to have an end-to-end encrypted system that has the level of security people need for their private messages — but uses things like reports, and some of the metadata we have, to ban people who appear to be sharing childhood exploitative imagery. And in some cases, make actual referrals to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We made something like 400,000 referrals last year, and that’s powered by reports. I think that’s very consistent with people’s model of privacy: if I send you something and you think it’s a problem and you want to ask for help, you should be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASIZrq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I talked to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProPublica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s president about all this, and he said look: at the end of the day, this company is saying that WhatsApp messages are totally private, when in fact in some cases they’re reviewed by humans. Do you think most of your users understand that dynamic, or could you do more there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLj9R0"&gt;I think people get this. There’s not confusion or concern from the people who actually use WhatsApp. Anyone who uses WhatsApp can go in and hit the report button, and it gets used a lot. It’s really transparent when you do that, that it’s going to send messages to us. So this whole particular criticism did surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHJOp9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wrote last week that WhatApp’s encryption-plus-reporting approach seemed to be trying to find a workable middle ground in a world where encryption is under threat. The services that provide it are probably going to have to make &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sort of concessions to the government. And so how do you maximally protect encryption while also enabling at least some kind of interfacing with law enforcement to catch the worst actors? Is this how you see it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySthki"&gt;I think about it a little differently. End-to-end encryption protects all of our users. It protects them by keeping their messages secure, while on top of that — letting people tell us if someone’s spamming protects our users. It’s usually framed as like, “are you picking privacy or are you picking safety?” I see this as the same thing — end-to-end encryption is one of most powerful technologies we have to protect people’s safety all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4LFMU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is making you comfortable that on balance, the benefits of the encryption you provide outweigh any harms that may be caused by people sort of having access to these protected systems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO7gPJ"&gt;I would say two things. One is, I just see the trends on all the threats going on around the world. And I think through, years from now, what are the consequences if we don’t have secure protection for our data? Especially in liberal societies, in a world where hostile governments have a very different worldview about privacy and information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQ8Iwh"&gt;And two, one thing I find helpful is thinking through real-world analogs. A lot of stuff feels so new that the debates feel very new, but the real-world equivalents, they’re not new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JSmuyQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Most people have an instinctive horrified reaction. I think that’s telling.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hxnhai"&gt;People have been able to meet in private in person and talk privately for hundreds and hundreds of years, and there’s no automatic system keeping a backup. There’s no automatic system relaying it to a company. And I think that’s been a good thing. Sometimes when you look at some of the proposals on breaking encryption, or traceability in India, or scanning every private photo against the database, and you just apply it to “Hey, how would you feel about doing this in people’s living rooms?” Most people have an instinctive horrified reaction. I think that’s telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owH7g1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the current global situation around end-to-end encryption globally. You’re currently suing the Indian government over new regulations that would require you to trace the originator of individual messages, and to filter messages based on what they contain. Presumably this would apply to encrypted backups as well. What’s at stake here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejaryY"&gt;With the IT rules in India, the specific thing those rules would require is us to build some system [to comply] if someone comes to us and says “Hey, someone said the words ‘XYZ.’ Tell us who the first person is who said the words XYZ.” That’s not private. And it undermines the security that end-to-end encryption provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zVbwF"&gt;I think 10 years from now, even more of our lives will be online. Even more of our sensitive data will be online. There will be even more sophisticated hackers, spyware companies, hostile governments, criminals trying to get access to it. And not having the best security means that information is stolen. I think that has real consequences for free society. If journalists’ information is being stolen, which we saw in some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;reporting around NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, I think that undermines the free press. If people who want to organize can’t communicate in private, I think that undermines their ability to advocate for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RHKqn"&gt;I think there’s a lot of core tenets of democracy and liberalism that actually rely on people being able to have private information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfpJgK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say you lose in India. Does that break encryption in WhatsApp globally, or can you contain the fallout to India somehow — and maybe eventually in other countries who might adopt similar rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeyjpE"&gt;You know, I don’t have a crystal ball. My hope is that over the next few years, increasingly governments will realize that on balance, the more important thing for them to do is protect their citizens’ data. That the threats are growing, and so their interest in protecting people’s security is higher, and therefore they’ll be dismissive of what some other countries are asking for. But I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IiSFr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to try to ask it again, though. If India says, “Sorry, Will, you lose on this one, you have to build this awful system.” Can the damage be contained to India?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZCklK"&gt;I think that there’s a political question and there’s a technical question. The way they wrote the rules, and what they’ve said, is that they only want it to apply it to people in India. But I think there’s a broader political question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWW1Jv"&gt;The more some countries see other countries do it, or push for it, the more they want to push for it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Hza4f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever long for the days when you had an easier job, like running the Facebook News Feed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KfyRc"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;) I love my job. I get that there are going to be questions. I get that when we launch things like end-to-end encrypted backups, there are going to be some people who criticize it. But at the end of the day I just feel so lucky to get to work on something that so many people love and use for stuff that’s so important.&lt;/p&gt;
