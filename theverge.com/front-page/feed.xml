    <title>XPG imagines a gaming mouse that can also store 1TB of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N6uX6Wt9WSefd-OlDCuX_VUjht8=/0x3:1500x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320363/xpg_peripheral.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Vault” is an appropriate name.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: XPG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Pqy4f"&gt;XPG &lt;a href="https://www.xpg.com/us/news/960"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; the XPG Vault, a “concept” mouse that has a built-in SSD to let you carry around your mouse and storage in one package (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/xpg-mouse-with-ssd-inside-210055310.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While lots of gaming mice have some built-in storage to let you easily carry macros and preferences from computer to computer, and the concept of a mouse doubling as a flash drive has &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-storage-mouse-does-double-duty/"&gt;been around for over a decade&lt;/a&gt;, XPG is aiming a little higher. It’s promising “to make your gaming libraries conveniently portable,” right from your mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fW0tVV"&gt;There aren’t many details for the Vault in XPG’s press release, but XPG says the “current prototype can integrate up to 1TB of Solid State memory running at 985MB/s” and connects with USB-C. Given that it’s a wired mouse, that performance seems possible — and it’d imply that you could actually play games stored on the Vault. There’s certainly enough room for a few titles, as long as one of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302057/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-modern-warfare-500gb-size"&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oL4DtG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The press release is light on details, but it’s still intriguing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zcaJA"&gt;However, it’s unclear what other levels of storage are available and if it’ll be upgradable (that seems hard to imagine, but it’s easy to wish for). There’s also no data about the SSD, though it’d probably be a safe bet that it’s made by ADATA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;the memory and SSD company&lt;/a&gt; that owns XPG. The press release also doesn’t include any specs that people serious about mousing will care about, like the Vault’s DPI or sensor. The company’s post does, however, also announce the XPG Alpha mouse, which looks a lot like the Vault. That one will use Pixart’s PAW3335 sensor and will have wireless capabilities at the cost of not having built-in storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jv9P6w"&gt;XPG says that visitors to its CES booth will get a “peek” at the Vault, so it’s always possible we’ll hear more details about it soon — it’d be interesting to know how heavy it is, whether you can actually play games off it, if there’s any difference in responsiveness when you’re using the SSD versus when you’re not, etc. Since &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; won’t be doing CES in person this year (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;along with many other companies&lt;/a&gt;), we reached out to XPG to see if we could get any more information and will update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnkvF7"&gt;Given that this is being billed as a “concept” and “prototype,” it’s possible this is the most we’ll ever hear about this mouse — that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225459/best-tech-ces-2020-where-are-they-now-what-happened-next"&gt;not exactly uncommon for things announced at CES&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s an interesting idea that doesn’t seem completely improbable; even if XPG doesn’t end up making this exact product, it’s possible we could have a future where you walk up to the LAN party with just your mouse, and that gives you access to all your games. You know, when LAN parties are safe to have again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spyware scandal rocks Polish government</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Polish Politics" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krNidajv99SY_bnWrQwm3nZREWc=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320191/1127310221.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Polish opposition leader Krzysztof Brejza | Photo by Mateusz Wlodarczyk/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbJbsw"&gt;Several members of political opposition groups in Poland have produced evidence that they were hacked by Pegasus spyware, raising alarming questions about the Polish government’s use of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcHthG"&gt;The most alarming case involved the leader of Poland’s Civic Platform party, Senator Krzysztof Brejza, whose phone was compromised a total of 33 times in the six months leading up to the 2019 election, as reported by &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-middle-east-elections-europe-c16b2b811e482db8fbc0bbc37c00c5ab"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the campaign, Polish state media published damaging text messages obtained from Brejza’s phone, leading to concerns that spyware had been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okQB4p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a threat to “the rules-based international order”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZawPy"&gt;The compromises were discovered by Citizen Lab, a spyware research group based at the University of Toronto, which has done extensive work on Pegasus. Citizen Lab previously found evidence linking the Pegasus spyware to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848485/pegasus-spyware-jamal-khashoggi-murder-nso-hanan-elatr-new-analysis"&gt;the killing of Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/a&gt; and a separate campaign &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/10/new-york-times-i-was-hacked-the-spyware-used-against-me-makes-us-all-vulnerable/"&gt;against a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuupgV"&gt;In the Polish case, Citizen Lab &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-poland-hacking-warsaw-8b52e16d1af60f9c324cf9f5099b687e"&gt;also found evidence&lt;/a&gt; of spyware compromises targeting a lawyer representing Polish opposition groups and a prosecutor involved in a case against the ruling Law and Justice party. In both cases, traces of Pegasus spyware were found on the targets’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygdCZC"&gt;Despite the evidence, the Polish government has steadfastly denied any use of spyware, either for intelligence gathering or domestic surveillance. “The Pegasus system is not used by the Polish services,” the Deputy Defense minister said recently, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-opposition-politician-accuses-government-phone-hack-krzysztof-brejza/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Politico Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It is not used to follow or investigate anyone in our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXqYg3"&gt;Still, the scandal is likely to have significant consequences for Poland’s standing in the European Union and build the case for further technical protections against Pegasus. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798917/apple-nso-group-spyware-pegasus-cybersecurity-research"&gt;In November&lt;/a&gt;, Apple filed a federal lawsuit against NSO Group (which develops and sells Pegasus), seeking a permanent injunction against the company’s use of Apple products and services. Amazon Web Services has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583523/amazon-web-services-bans-nso-group-pegasus-spyware-infrastructure"&gt;blocked all accounts linked with NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, and the US Treasury Department has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;moved to block exports or other transactions with the company&lt;/a&gt;, calling it a threat to “the rules-based international order.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deck out your new Oculus Quest 2 with discounted accessories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkEcKycLv292wsL9QmIPiknPUuY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320035/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNjXUu"&gt;During the Christmas holiday, it was easy to pick up on the theme on Twitter that &lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;of you either bought or received an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. Well, in perfect timing, Oculus has discounted many of its official accessories for the Quest 2, which can help to protect your headset, as well as make it more comfortable to wear. We’ve seen promotions that discount these add-ons when you purchase a headset, but never by themselves, so that’s why they’re prominently featured today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnLZic"&gt;Best Buy has the best deal on the Elite Strap that replaces the fabric strap that comes with your Quest 2. It distributes the weight of the headset more evenly on your head, with adjusters on the top and rear of the Elite Strap. Normally $49, it’s just $34 at Best Buy (it’s $34 at Amazon, too, but it’ll ship in five to six weeks, apparently). It costs $39 at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my6nUQ"&gt;I recently bought one, and I’m about to buy another — not because I love them &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much, mind you. Based on my experience, they tend to last about a year under normal wear-and-tear, with the plastic side arms eventually breaking. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176820/oculus-quest-2-elite-strap-extended-warranty-quality-problems"&gt;Oculus now offers a two-year warranty on this product&lt;/a&gt;, and the company can replace broken straps free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8EKSeH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nghmP"&gt;I also recommend the Oculus Quest 2 zip-up case, which provides a safe place for your headset and controllers to reside when they aren’t in use. We’re also seeing this product discounted for the first time, from $49 down to $39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D05JMy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949359"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp04YA"&gt;Micro Center retail stores aren’t too common to find in the US, but if you have one near you, you can get the best price on Apple’s new AirPods Pro that offer MagSafe charging. These launched at $249.99, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/643985/apple-airpods-pro-active-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-with-magsafe-white"&gt;but they’re all the way down to $159.99&lt;/a&gt;. You can reserve a set online at the store closest to you, but you’ll need to actually make the trek to a Micro Center store to pick them up. That might be worth it to some, but don’t fret if it’s a no-go with you. We’re likely to see this deal at other retailers in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fn5wft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10934767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcMN6Y"&gt;The Microsoft 365 Family plan (one-year, auto-renewing, up to six people) — which gives you access to apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, as well as 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage for each person, and more — is selling for its normal $99.99 cost, but it comes with a complimentary $50 gift card. You’ll receive a digital code for Microsoft 365 Family, but the $50 Amazon gift card will be delivered by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LBWIAP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7NPcy6"&gt;In the latest round of “deals I should have had the patience to wait a few more weeks for,” &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei V&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is down to $34.99 from its normal $59.99 price. This game is often compared to &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s not an unfounded comparison, given that the franchise was spun out of &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niJ5Uj"&gt;You’ll find some similarities, primarily in the turn-based combat, the foes you’re up against, and the fact that they’re both long-lasting RPG adventures. Though, &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; has a reputation for being more difficult and brooding than &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;. They’re each great in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3UEPU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949375"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJb5co"&gt;Other deals that may interest you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZjkuIB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds-2nd-Gen-Wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-and-Alexa/dp/B085WTYQ4X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; with active noise cancellation and USB-C charging cost just $69.99 at Amazon, down from their normal $119.99 price. This model comes with a wired charging case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lgJHsK"&gt;We saw the bronze-colored Ember Smart Mug 2 selling at a discount before the holidays, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiidQHszZJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the white-colored mug is discounted&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy right now, costing $99.99. This is $30 off the usual cost.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>10 great games for your new gaming PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qq-NTAKtQxEt_Kmslg-0oH3UXG8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70319892/RoundUpArt_PCGames.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Armies, aliens, automobiles, the legendary mascot of the Xbox, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GFHxPA"&gt;Getting a new gaming PC is a bit like opening Pandora’s Box when it comes to deciding what to play. With frequent releases on Steam, a never-ending flow of free games on the Epic Games Store, a plethora of indie arthouse games on &lt;a href="http://itch.io"&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, and countless other launchers and storefronts to install and choose from, it can feel like the Netflix effect of paralysis by choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6gOx5"&gt;So if you got yourself a new PC for the holiday, or even earlier, this list of excellent games released this year is a primer on what to consider. Some may be no-brainers because they are the biggest releases of the last few months, but others should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IQNqTf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft rebrands Xbox Game Pass for PC to just PC Game Pass","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dnp1IP"&gt;Many titles featured here can be downloaded and played via a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fpc-games&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22803171%2Fgaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PC Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; subscription, the PC version of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, while subscribers to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22803171%2Fgaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; get access to games on both Xbox and PC platforms. Whether you prefer to buy each title individually or subscribe to gain access to many, here are our top games with which to initiate your new gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTOG50"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10929478" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lpYJYT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riUhAOaGM7EavFnk8UI7wLk6GRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066588/HaloInfinite_Campaign01_3840x2160_WM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 343 Industries/Xbox Game Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite is the sixth installment in the mainline Master Chief saga.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7FtYW"&gt;This may be the most obvious first choice, as it’s arguably the biggest game release of the holidays, but &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s &lt;/em&gt;open world&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;promises to be both a technological test of PC hardware and a compelling title for some throwback solo campaign fun. Combine that with free-to-play online multiplayer that launched early, and &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;is back, baby! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzBI0f"&gt;Now, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821522/halo-infinite-campaign-levels-replay-mission-select-343-industries-microsoft"&gt;some oversights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;key features missing at launch&lt;/a&gt;, but there is still a lot to enjoy with &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; in its current form. It hopefully only gets better from here as they eventually expand it with campaign co-op and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816491/halo-infinite-multiplayer-deathmatch-slayer-dedicated-playlist"&gt;continue to grow the multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YBXiKW"&gt;What happens when you mix together a ton of cars, Playground Games’ open-world arcade racing franchise, and the beautiful landscape of Mexico? You get the best racing game of 2021, complete with AI Drivatars based on your friends list to challenge you. Part of the fun of &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;is you can play it however you want. Looking to embrace its hardcore motorsports side? There are cars and courses for that. Want to take it off-road in the mud and the muck? That’s here, too. Prefer to take it easy and just enjoy driving around? The rewind feature makes it easy to undo any careless errors that could cost you a race. &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;makes for a great pick-up-and-play experience, and there’s a lot to experience among all the cars and environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inscryption mixes horror tones with a roguelike card game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LmkkLG"&gt;It doesn’t have to be spooky season for you to get into one of the top indie hits of the year. &lt;em&gt;Inscryption &lt;/em&gt;is a horror-themed deck-building card game with a blend of roguelike loop progression. The real trick, though, is how the game keeps changing things on you as the story progresses. We’re not going to get into spoilers here but be prepared for some unexpected turns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4qsXp"&gt;Even if you’re scarcely a fan of card games or escape rooms — even if you just played a couple of games of &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering &lt;/em&gt;as a kid or did one escape room with friends at their peak a few years ago — you should try out &lt;em&gt;Inscryption.&lt;/em&gt; It may not put your PC’s graphics to the test, but if you have a good monitor with quality black levels, you can really immerse yourself in the creepy aesthetic as you play cards and sacrifice little monsters to battle your eery AI opponent hiding in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood features four-player online co-op with card-based power-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk72TY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood &lt;/em&gt;is the spiritual successor to the &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;franchise of four-player co-op zombie shooters. It not only carries a similarly styled title but also maintains some of the original &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt; developers of Turtle Rock Studios. Now, &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; merges the classic, co-operative FPS action of &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;with a modern take on power-ups based around a card system. The cards make each session feel a bit different, keeping you on your toes as you mow down hordes of zombies and have to adapt to what fate draws you. Aside from the cards, the weapons and quip-filled characters are the stars of the show. Get yourself three friends to team up with and blast zombie after zombie until you’ve had your fill.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV is the latest installment for the RTS series that first started in 1997.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xCZV09"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires &lt;/em&gt;series is old enough to be past its college life and struggling through a middling job while living in a crummy apartment, but &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV &lt;/em&gt;is a captivating new sequel that feels just like its roots. Anyone who has played a classic RTS before will be right at home here, though judging by conversations in &lt;em&gt;The Verge S&lt;/em&gt;lack channels, that home is a very addictive one. &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV &lt;/em&gt;expertly scratches that itch for base building, troop placement, and massive battles. The campaigns are quite dense, but be sure to try playing as the Mongols for a new twist on the old formula — with hit-and-run tactics and mobility being the new keys to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death’s Door is an isometric souls-like action RPG with highly stylized artwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUeM6Y"&gt;There is no prettier game from 2021 than &lt;em&gt;Death’s Door. &lt;/em&gt;It’s enough of a joy just to look at, with a lush world that’s beautifully animated, but the gameplay feels part-&lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, part-&lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and all-satisfying when in action. The Nintendo Switch release just came out last month, but playing it on a PC to ensure the visuals are as juiced up as possible does wonders to make this lovely virtual space as immersive and captivating as can be. Don’t sleep on this indie hit. It’s a great way to spend a dozen or so hours of your time, and come on — the protagonist crow is just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; dang cute.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels Unleashed supersizes the stunt toy racers with a sense of speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nR6e0o"&gt;Imagine you’re a kid again and given an unlimited budget to build and race the zaniest Hot Wheels track you could possibly imagine. Now, even better, you’re an adult, and instead of tying up all your money and floor space in plastic tracks and 1:64 scale die-cast metal cars, you can play &lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels: Unleashed.&lt;/em&gt; But before you write this off as a kids’ video game, you must see the dedication the developers at Milestone put into all these toy car models. There are 60 cars for you to collect and race, with each one lovingly rendered down to its tiny toy details, with visible vehicle damage that looks a whole lot like the way actual Hot Wheels develop wear and tear. Add those visual stylings to the high-speed racing with split-screen support, and you have a fun arcade racer that looks and plays great on a high-end PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MOiS99"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911302" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien: Fireteam Elite is a co-op third-person shooter pitting players against the iconic xenomorphs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LnKuyH"&gt;If a game like &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; sounds appealing for its co-op chops, but you feel that zombies are a bit tired, check out &lt;em&gt;Aliens: Fireteam Elite. &lt;/em&gt;This is a three-player, third-person shooter pitting you against the xenomorphs of the storied &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; franchise lore. There’s a touch of RPG passive buffs to choose in your class loadouts, but in the end, it’s alien-shooting fun with friends. Keep your comms open and your tactics tight because these acid-blooded monsters like to swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the original Xbox title from 2005.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scfyZW"&gt;Few games have had such critical acclaim and fan anticipation for a sequel as the original &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts&lt;/em&gt;. Now, 16 years later, the classic Double Fine action-adventure game finally gets its follow-up. Just like the original, &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 &lt;/em&gt;is brimming with charm, excellent voice acting, and fun writing that, while lighthearted, also tackles some deeply personal themes. It feels a bit like an older game, for better and worse, but with a fantastical-level design that is supremely unique. &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 &lt;/em&gt;takes you on a journey of joyous platforming and thought-provoking empathy. Don’t pass this one up, especially if you already have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VuIPjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911364" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boomerang X is a single-player first-person arena action game focusing on movement and speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bDP9WA"&gt;Few games exhibit a sense of speed and agility quite like &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X.&lt;/em&gt; The first-person action game is all about maintaining momentum as you fly around arenas by way of your character’s thrown boomerang. Throw it at enemies to slice them up, then vault towards it for aerial combos reminiscent of the visceral mid-air stunts of old &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; rocket jumps. The visual style and lighting of &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X &lt;/em&gt;ensure that each arena is fun to explore, and the enemies keep it fresh and challenging. While &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X &lt;/em&gt;is also available on Nintendo Switch, I believe playing it with a mouse and keyboard is the better experience. You get more pinpoint control, and it truly feels like a shooter of a bygone era with very fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8X1B1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911369" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="yE1iMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ztwRXpAgKNAXbFJtgKwEZdb4MI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071388/Photo4165006.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation is a post-apocalyptic first-person photography game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CGnxjt"&gt;OK, so I cheated a little. &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;first&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;came out in 2020, not 2021. But double-check that headline and do the math — consider this just an added bonus because I cannot pass up any opportunity to recommend &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;and its &lt;em&gt;Macro &lt;/em&gt;DLC to anyone. The Nintendo Switch version did come out in 2021, but while it does feature new tilt controls, I believe it’s worth playing this excellent indie darling on a PC for the best representation of its awesome visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATEN5j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;is a first-person photography game that drips with style and weaves an excellent narrative through environmental storytelling. Enjoy its vibrant aesthetic, expansive photographic camera controls, and fantastic soundtrack by ThorHighHeels — all while the sense of dread sets in from its post-apocalyptic world. Remember, even if you don’t want to watch the world burn, you don’t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0VHmbq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911377" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>This ambitious smart ring hopes to one day monitor chronic illnesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Renders of four Movano Rings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNDHV5n5_O-AjPSfu20XWudMsT8=/75x0:2325x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70319577/Offset_Ad.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movano Ring is a smart ring with medical ambitions&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Movano&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23UKBW"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only smart ring on the block anymore. For CES 2022, health tech company &lt;a href="https://movano.com/"&gt;Movano&lt;/a&gt; is announcing the Movano Ring, a wearable that aims to help people affordably monitor chronic illnesses and better understand their data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oe4p0F"&gt;The Movano Ring will measure all the basic metrics, including heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), sleep, respiration, temperature, blood oxygen levels, steps, and calories burned. However, instead of a raw data dump, Movano says it’ll distill how your metrics relate to each other “take a more proactive approach to mitigating the risks of chronic disease.” For example, the Movano app might tell you how your exercise habits impact your sleeping patterns or HRV over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei3Xae"&gt;This isn’t surprising — more wearable makers are shifting away from steps and calories in favor of simplified scores and insights. The Oura Ring, Whoop, and Fitbit all use scores to contextualize sleep and recovery data but mostly focus on telling you whether to push yourself or take it easy on a given day. They’re also accompanied by graphs and lengthy descriptions that can, at times, be overwhelming. Movano says it wants its insights to be more actionable. So far, the app screenshots that Movano showed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; don’t show anything groundbreaking, but the way the data is presented is more digestible than many trackers out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Movano app describing how a user’s data shows that they sleep better on days they exercise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVPl6LzTQlsCOBT2btO2DYxjFvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120760/IndividualScreens3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Movano&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plenty of wearables offer similar data, but the way it’s presented here is much easier to digest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QFWf1a"&gt;There are a few other things that help the Movano Ring stand out. For starters, the device itself isn’t hideous and is impressively slim. The emphasis on a sleeker design was a deliberate choice, says Movano CEO Dr. John Mastrototaro, as the device was specifically designed for women of all ages. That’s notable in two ways. First, wearable tech has historically favored traditionally masculine styles and sizes. Smart rings like the Oura Ring and the now-defunct Motiv Ring have also tended to be on the chunkier side. That’s mainly because it’s hard to miniaturize sensors with current technology, but a side-effect is that they’re less suitable for petite hands. A truly slim and sleek smart ring would be a first. Second, only a handful of wearables companies take a women-first approach. Some have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-study-affirms-that-women-do-in-fact-have-cramps-d-1846431781"&gt;tried addressing the issue&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still a &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/davos-2020/5764698/gender-data-gap/"&gt;huge gender gap&lt;/a&gt; in medical data. (Fun fact: it wasn’t until 1993 that Congress &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/inclusion/women-and-minorities/guidelines.htm#:~:text=The%20NIH%20Revitalization%20Act%20of,and%20minorities%20in%20clinical%20research.&amp;amp;text=The%20statute%20includes%20a%20specific,and%2C%20in%20particular%20clinical%20trials."&gt;mandated women and minorities be included in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsywLv"&gt;But the big thing is that while most wearable companies sidestep questions about FDA approval, Movano is frank about its medical ambitions. According to Mastrototaro, while the first Movano Ring won’t have FDA clearances, the goal is to eventually get &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumers-medical-devices/learn-if-medical-device-has-been-cleared-fda-marketing"&gt;Class II designation&lt;/a&gt; and add medical features like non-invasive glucose monitoring and cuffless blood pressure in a “step-by-step” manner over time. To do that, the company is conducting clinical trials for its radio frequency-enabled tech and algorithms, as well as accuracy studies to gain FDA clearance for heart rate, SpO2, and respiratory rate monitoring. Non-invasive glucose monitoring and cuffless blood pressure are holy grails for wearable tech — and big names, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;, have been rumored to be working on these features for smartwatches. Bringing them to a smart ring would be an impressive achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s miraculously not chunky — a big win for smart rings if this ever gets to market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kkV5iI"&gt;That said, consumer wearables promising medical features often end up in regulatory limbo. The Withings ScanWatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;made its debut&lt;/a&gt; at CES in January 2020, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22772984/withings-scanwatch-blood-oxygen-sleep-apnea-watch-fda"&gt;wasn’t until November 2021&lt;/a&gt; that it obtained the FDA clearance necessary to hit the US market. Its Move ECG smartwatch was announced even earlier but still has yet to receive clearance. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-first-smartwatch-to-read-your-blood-pressure-is-an-1833612732"&gt;Omron’s HeartGuide blood pressure smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; also took several years to clear. It often means companies end up choosing between making consumer wellness devices that lack medical credibility or niche medical devices that are inaccessible to the average person. However, Mastrototaro says Movano’s got a secret trump card: decades of regulatory experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niZwNi"&gt;“We’re taking the regulatory side of things very seriously,” Mastrototaro told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He also pointed to his long history in developing medical devices, including the first continuous glucose monitor, as well as that of his staff. That experience, Mastrototaro says, gives Movano an edge in navigating the FDA’s notoriously opaque clearance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4azG2"&gt;The Movano Ring won’t be available until the second half of 2022, and even then, it’ll be a beta version. We also don’t have any concrete details for pricing, though Mastrototaro says the company aims for it to be “one of the most affordable” on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGb5gZ"&gt;“We’re aiming for both a medical and consumer focus — the intersection of these two fields as opposed to one or the other. We want to have the look, feel, and affordability of a consumer device with the accuracy and reliability of a medical device,” says Mastrototaro. What Mastrototaro is describing is the holy grail of wearable tech. We’ll have to see if the Movano Ring ends up being another CES pipedream, but it’s certainly one of the more ambitious takes on smart rings that we’ve seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Display shows off a versatile lineup of transparent OLED screens at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNYriOXOEEcwL03j23fxud8vjbo=/0x344:4968x3656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70318789/lg_display_oled_shelf.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TpdYwA"&gt;LG Display has come up with more uses for transparent screens with its innovative new concepts that will be on display at CES 2022: the OLED Shelf, Shopping Managing Showcase, Show Window, and Smart Window. The company is not to be confused with LG Electronics, as LG Display simply creates concepts that other companies can adopt and introduce to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0g2SAL"&gt;Its OLED Shelf, visible at the top of this story, consists of two 55-inch transparent OLED displays mounted on top of one another, with a shelf at the very top. LG Display says it’s ideal for the living room, where it can display art, a TV show, or one on each of the two screens simultaneously. Always on Display Mode ensures that the screen can stay on all the time. If there was a piece of art on display, that image could stay put just like a painting, all while blending into the wall behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MOA40sMjzUR3F_O_O50uULPUzBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23127627/lg_display_oled_shelf.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another view of the OLED Shelf, with the opaque roll-down material visible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2a1JS8"&gt;There’s actually room for you to put an &lt;em&gt;actual &lt;/em&gt;painting behind the screens, too, which you’d be able to see when they’re off. LG’s also devised a motorized sheet of opaque material which rolls down like a projector screen to make their images more vibrant and less ethereal. (Images viewed on transparent screens can sometimes look ghostly.) The pedestal you see in the image above houses some of the electronics, and the screens take standard HDMI input.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MeCIKk9roNDbtaLfYu46Xn91KP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23126574/lg_display_shopping_managing_showcase.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Shopping Managing Showcase highlights perfume.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kshY5v"&gt;While the OLED Shelf is built for the home, LG Display says its Shopping Managing Showcase is meant for “luxurious” department stores. A transparent OLED display is attached to a sleek wooden stand, and when placed in front of physical products, it looks like it could create a futuristic shopping experience. It adds an overlay to the items behind it, which means storeowners could add graphics that highlight certain parts of their products, or even use the display to provide funky visual effects. We saw a video where flowy graphics drew our eye to one of the perfume bottles in the display above, giving it a lustrous halo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnW79D9WskNuChLLtOwci_HQKc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23126581/lg_display_show_window.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The LG Display Show Window could create unique window displays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7z32Wp"&gt;LG Display also gave us a glimpse of its Show Window, another business-focused model that consists of four 55-inch transparent OLED displays that could be used to play up products in window displays — instead of window decals, stores could add digital text, which can easily be changed at any time. The company says versions of it are already on display at &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/05/lg-display-x-musinsa-transparent-oled-trendiness/"&gt;the new Musinsa fashion store&lt;/a&gt; in Seoul, as well as art exhibitions &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/12/a-hopeful-future-with-oled-art-at-the-smithsonian/"&gt;at The Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/10/transparent-oled-lights-up-londons-art-scene/amp/"&gt;at 180 The Strand in London&lt;/a&gt;, inside some subway car windows in China and Japan, and &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/08/bvlgari-colors-come-alive-through-oled/"&gt;a Bulgari fashion show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMQ0Io"&gt;The company also showed off its Smart Window, another transparent OLED screen that can be for video calls or presentations in the office, however, it didn’t provide any images of that display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EricDE"&gt;Since these transparent displays are just concepts, we probably won’t see many of them in the real world, but that doesn’t change the fact that they’re still pretty darn cool to look at — and LG Display says it’s ready to help customers produce some of them if they want. “If any of our customers want, we can provide [the OLED Shelf],” LG Display spokesperson Jean Lee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying it’s ready for production. All of these displays consist of the same 55-inch 1080p transparent OLED panels with 40 percent transparency, which Lee says is on the company’s 8th generation display manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teuIkK"&gt;LG Display has been in the transparent display game for a while now, revealing its &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2014/07/lg-display-unveils-18-inch-flexible-and-transparent-oled-panels/"&gt;first flexible and see-through screen in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, it showed off a transparent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223774/lg-transparent-oled-tv-display-55-inch-smart-bed-ces-2021"&gt;TV screen mounted to the foot of a bed&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn’t just dabble in transparent screens — the company is also showcasing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850959/lg-display-media-chair-virtual-ride-concepts-ces-2022"&gt;half-moon-shaped chair with a built-in OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; at CES this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2E5iA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:58 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly hires away Meta’s AR public relations head</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pF74kp-qt5CHXXQ-TkkLdBwnpvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70318197/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="th1dJ0"&gt;Apple has reportedly hired Andrea Schubert, Meta’s communications and public relations lead for its augmented reality (AR) products, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman in his &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. Schubert’s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrearagni"&gt;LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; indicates that she’s been working for Meta for nearly six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cMjdet"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Meta, with Oculus, has been the market leader in headsets, so such a hire makes sense as Apple nears its launch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rValof"&gt;“Meta, with Oculus, has been the market leader in headsets, so such a hire makes sense as Apple nears its launch,” Gurman explains. On both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810083/cyber-monday-spending-down-early-shopping"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, Meta’s Oculus Quest 2 was one of the top-selling products. Not to mention that Meta’s Oculus app &lt;a href="https://apptopia.com/store-insights/top-charts/itunes-connect/top-overall/united-states"&gt;topped the App Store&lt;/a&gt; in the US on Christmas Day, and became the number one free app on the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/top"&gt;Google Play store today&lt;/a&gt;, a potential sign that a significant amount of people received the headset as a gift this holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrmLwX"&gt;Rumors continue to swirl around Apple’s AR/VR headset, with Apple remaining tight-lipped about the product. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; previously reported that the headset could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;cost a whopping $3,000 and come with 8K displays&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;3D sensors for hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;. The headset may also have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;rely on a connected iPhone or Mac&lt;/a&gt; for processor-heavy tasks. We might not have to wait too much longer for Apple to officially take the wraps off of the rumored headset, however. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the mixed-reality headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;could launch sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Northman, Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, The Silent Sea, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7H5T7svM9oLrk-Cy3O1k0INLnE=/336x0:1556x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317886/northman2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alexander Skarsgård is out for revenge in The Northman  | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMSdFM12hOw&amp;amp;ab_channel=FocusFeatures" target="_blank"&gt;Focus Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XDD6bS"&gt;Hello and welcome to the final trailers roundup for 2021, I hope you have enjoyed reading (and watching) these roundups as much as I have enjoyed writing them. There were a lot of really good streaming shows and movies this year despite the persistence of the coronavirus that disrupted so much of our lives. Among my personal favorites were &lt;em&gt;Loki, Succession, Ted Lasso, The Beatles: Get Back, King Richard, and Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; (pls someone pick up this show it was just getting started!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4s8Pvh"&gt;This week’s list has Vikings, Hercule Poirot, and a look at the upcoming Showtime series about the early days of Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ov081F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMSdFM12hOw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VYoUCu"&gt;The Northman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6MqYBM"&gt;Director Robert Eggers (&lt;em&gt;The Witch&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;), said in an &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/trailers/alexander-skarsgard-the-northman-trailer-video/"&gt;interview with EW&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Northman&lt;/em&gt; was “by far the hardest thing” he’s done. These are not warm and fuzzy Vikings, let’s put it that way. As a child, Amleth, the heir to the Viking throne, witnesses his uncle Fjolnir murder his father. King Aurvandi, providing him with the mantra “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” And side note, even though they all speak English, the Vikings (in the trailer at least) have what sound like appropriate Scandinavian accents. Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, and Willem Dafoe star in &lt;em&gt;The Northman,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hl9ZW1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3srHCvDAFE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QnMIru"&gt;Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk2VUe"&gt;Based on the book of the same name by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist Mike Isaac, &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber&lt;/em&gt;, is the story of how Travis Kalanick founded the ride-hailing startup that became the unicorn that every VC in Silicon Valley wanted in on (or at least, they did in the beginning). Kalanick was ultimately ousted from the CEO role of the company he founded, but not before a lot of drama, both in public and behind the scenes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Uma Thurman, and Kyle Chandler star in &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Showtime February 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fqwsud"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Af_Hj0MDBBQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oDTqIn"&gt;The Silent Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NVZ1VX"&gt;OK so this trailer isn’t&lt;em&gt; brand&lt;/em&gt; new but this series looks cool as hell. The Earth is a dried up husk, and a team of astronauts are heading to the Moon on a mission to retrieve an “important sample” from a research station. They crash land on the Moon and then discover all is not well at Balhae Station and the government (gasp) may have lied to them (plus, in what seems a nice homage to the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; movies, their tracking device detects “bio-signals” approaching them). Gong Yoo, Bae Doona, and Lee Joon star in &lt;em&gt;The Silent Sea&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted its first episode on Netflix December 24th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rdu8NN"&gt;Death on the Nile &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LXZKo3"&gt;Kenneth Branagh’s version of one of Agatha Christie’s best-known Hercule Poirot mysteries is one of the many theatrical releases that was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Poirot is aboard a ship on the Nile River, when a murder occurs and he has to determine who among the ship’s passengers is responsible. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/death-on-the-nile-trailer-armie-hammer.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Armie Hammer is still in &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt; (there’s a mere glimpse of him in this trailer), despite some &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/armie-hammer-scandal-death-on-the-nile-disney-1235065530/"&gt;apparent discussion within Disney&lt;/a&gt; of reshooting his scenes or removing him digitally after the actor was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. Gal Gadot, Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Ali Fazal, Dawn French, Tom Bateman, Rose Leslie, Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Jennifer Saunders, and Letitia Wright also star in &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xXt3W5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rt_UqUm38BI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WT3Z1s"&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dNGEOn"&gt;This trailer for this sequel to &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; originally appeared after the end credits of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, and takes place after the end of that movie. Strange warns that “the multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little,” so of course the movie brings him deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe concept of alternate timelines. Wanda Maximoff, Wong, and Mordo return, and we meet America Chavez, one of the Young Avengers from the comics. Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and  Xochitl Gomez star in &lt;em&gt;Doctor&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters May 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla owner blows up Model S instead of footing $22,600 repair bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY14_97HFXtl50zv2sGh92dQvAM=/7x0:2140x1422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317450/tesla_model_s_dynamite.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m64vjh"&gt;When faced with a repair bill that costs half of what you paid for your car, do you go through with the expensive repair, bring it to the junkyard, or sell it for parts? Finnish Tesla owner Tuomas Katainen decided to do something a little more extreme — but arguably a lot more satisfying — when faced with such a situation: he watched his car go up in flames, as noted in a report from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/finnish-man-passes-on-paying-22-600-to-replace-his-tes-1848268874"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJ1Bx2"&gt;Katainen handed his 2013 Tesla Model S over to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr1cNqiNxK46w93zw9KfTLg"&gt;Pommijätkät&lt;/a&gt;, a group of explosion experts on YouTube who loves to make things go “boom,” after he was quoted $22,600 for a battery replacement. “Well when I bought that Tesla, the first 1,500km [932 miles] were nice,” Katainen recounted. “Then, error codes hit.” After Katainen brought his Tesla to a mechanic, he found out that the only way to fix the car would be to replace the entire battery pack, which would cost him at least 20,000€, or around $22,600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sfxczS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The group behind Pommijätkät strapped 66 pounds of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ydxxt"&gt;I think anyone would be pretty frustrated at that point, considering that the base price for a new 2013 Tesla Model S started at $57,400, later &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/2013-model-s-price-increase"&gt;increasing to $59,900&lt;/a&gt; when the car first came out. Even &lt;a href="https://www.carfax.com/Used-2013-Tesla-Model-S_z25929"&gt;a standard used model&lt;/a&gt; currently goes for around $30,000 at the lowest. That’s probably why Katainen picked up the Tesla from the shop and told the mechanic that he’s going to “explode the whole car away.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ISQBF"&gt;For context, these cars come with an eight-year (or up to 150,000 miles) &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/vehicle-warranty"&gt;battery and drive unit warranty&lt;/a&gt;, but the warranties on older models are starting to expire, revealing the potential cost behind a full battery replacement. In September, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/13/tesla-battery-pack-replacement-repair/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on a Tesla owner in need of a battery replacement on a Model S that was no longer under warranty. As noted in the report, he was quoted $22,500 from Tesla, but ended up getting a repair for $5,000 from a third-party shop. Katainen’s quote was also from Tesla, and it’s unclear whether he had access to an alternative repair service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKwuNs"&gt;Either way, the group behind Pommijätkät strapped 30kg (66 pounds) of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry in Jaala, Finland. Even Elon Musk was there — well, at least in spirit. A crash test dummy outfitted with a helmet, thick winter jacket, and a picture of Musk’s face was dropped in by helicopter and then stuffed in the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1mmlC"&gt;Katainen triggers the explosion from inside a nearby bunker, and Tesla erupts in a ball of fire, with what seems like thousands of pieces scattering throughout the snowy landscape. The group picks up whatever was left of the car, which amounts to just a pile of scraps. When asked whether he’s ever had this much fun behind the wheel of a Tesla, Katainen replies, “No, never enjoyed this much with Tesla!”&lt;/p&gt;
