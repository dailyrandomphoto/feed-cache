    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptops at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ow4mCb"&gt;Our pick for the best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOuHb0"&gt;The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top gaming laptops now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as new gaming laptop models hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers. Intel’s Tiger Lake H series is also on its way, though we expect to see those more frequently in lighter-weight models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. The upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;, for example, will offer up to a 240Hz panel with QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qnyi8k"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is the best gaming laptop under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MaGh3q"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. It’s the best gaming laptop you can buy under $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="n9BvYP"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="E7sNUb"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tCRMB0"&gt;A gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YDSZZF"&gt;A sturdy 13-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8Da3D3"&gt;The Blade Stealth 13 is far from the most powerful gaming rig out there, but it is one of very few gaming systems that come in a 13-inch chassis. The Stealth can run AAA titles at native resolution and comes with a 120Hz screen, but it’s comparable in size and weight to a MacBook Pro. Use it in a meeting or a classroom, and passing observers may have no idea it’s a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xdg8S1"&gt;In addition to its powerful chips, the Stealth comes with a colorful keyboard, a sturdy build, and a decent webcam. Even the battery life is pretty good. If you’re looking for a laptop that’s small but mighty, the Stealth will get the job done as a gaming rig and productivity machine in one. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gGsXN9"&gt;We have a very clear picture of what the upcoming OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro will look like thanks to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;— the site has &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,121663.html"&gt;published a whole bunch of official press renders&lt;/a&gt; of the upcoming phones well ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315517/oneplus-9-launch-date-hasselblad-camera"&gt;March 23rd launch&lt;/a&gt;. We got our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;first official look&lt;/a&gt; at the upcoming flagship in a teaser video from OnePlus earlier this week, but this latest leak features both regular and Pro models from multiple angles in a variety of colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodKHK"&gt;These renders align with what OnePlus has already shared, and they also resemble an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;alleged prototype device&lt;/a&gt; that was leaked late last year. It appears that the OnePlus 9 Pro will come with a slightly curved 6.7-inch display, and the OnePlus 9 will feature a flat 6.5-inch screen. That’s about the extent of the spec details in this leak; &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; speculates that the 9 may use a plastic chassis rather than metal, but it’s hard to say for sure based on these images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xusBIS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10385194"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pZUzb"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; evident is the Hasselblad branding on both devices’ camera bumps, thanks to a new partnership. Both phones include a Sony IMX789 sensor in the main camera, and as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;confirmed by OnePlus CEO Pete Lau&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, an ultrawide camera will be included with a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor. That’s an unusually high resolution count for an ultrawide, but as Lau demonstrates with some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369505640771633157"&gt;side-by-side images&lt;/a&gt;, those extra pixels might allow for more aggressive distortion correction and cropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZ85vg"&gt;Outside of camera lenses, these renderings show the range of color options we can likely expect from the 9 and 9 Pro. The 9 Pro is shown in sturdy black, olive green, and metallic silver. The 9 looks to be offered in black, with more laid-back blue and purple options available, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Artifacts from the first COVID-19 vaccination in the US are headed to the Smithsonian</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pbxYge"&gt;The glass vial used in the first US COVID-19 vaccination has been acquired by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The museum also acquired related items including the scrubs and vaccination card of Sandra Lindsay, director of critical care nursing at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center who, on December 14th, 2020, became the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/nyregion/us-covid-vaccine-first-sandra-lindsay.html"&gt;first person in the US to receive a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecF94d"&gt;“The urgent need for effective vaccines in the U.S. was met with unprecedented speed,” said Anthea M. Hartig, the museum’s Elizabeth MacMillan director, &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-collects-objects-first-known-us-covid-19-vaccination-effort"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. “These now historic artifacts document not only this remarkable scientific progress but represent the hope offered to millions living through the cascading crises brought on by COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmW2rZ"&gt;The announcement on Tuesday happened days before the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21156325/coronavirus-pandemic-who-declares-covid-19-outbreak-global-h1n1"&gt;declaring the outbreak a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Since April 2020, a special task force at the museum has been seeking out objects and documentation related to COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsybbX"&gt;“We’ve had everything from offers of masks that people have made to objects related to treatment of Covid, to practitioners offering us objects related to how they’ve gone about protecting themselves or their family,” Alexandra Lord, chair of the museum’s division of medicine and science, &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/first-vial-used-us-covid-19-vaccinations-joins-smithsonian-collections-180977194/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8560k"&gt;The vial and other items are joining the museum’s collection of materials related to historic epidemics and pandemics, including objects related to the polio epidemic, the 1957 influenza pandemic, and the HIV / AIDS pandemic. Many items from the collection will be on display in a 2022 exhibition, “In Sickness and in Health.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC revenue drops nearly 90 percent in fourth quarter, but CEO remains optimistic </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AMC’s Stock Is Latest Target For Retail Investors Organized On Reddit Message Boards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ShBF7mTd1ChCTkBBg9x7ucshPDc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944942/1298998015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="feQYaJ"&gt;AMC Theaters reported another jarring but predictable loss in its &lt;a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/472643608/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-4Q-2020-earnings-press-release-20210310-1435-clean-v.f.pdf"&gt;fourth quarter earnings&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s CEO is optimistic that the theater chain will make it out of the pandemic alright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSXdGG"&gt;Revenue was down 88 percent year over year, to $162.5 million. While beating expectations, that still led to a quarterly loss of $946 million (slightly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545812/amc-theaters-financial-earnings-q3-bankruptcy-streaming-warner-bros-disney-regal#:~:text=The%20company%20posted%20a%20revenue,91%20percent%20year%20over%20year."&gt;better than the last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, though significantly worse than the $13.5 million loss AMC reported in its 2019 fourth quarter), but AMC also has more than $1 billion in cash on hand, according to CEO Adam Aron. On the tailwinds of announcements that New York City &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295880/new-york-city-movie-theaters-open-cuomo"&gt;would start to allow theaters&lt;/a&gt; to open, and studios seemingly preparing to head back to theaters, Aron is trying to find the positives while acknowledging the “most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD3JMi"&gt;“As we sit here today, we see that vaccinations are occurring in the United States at a brisk clip, our theatres in New York City have finally opened with theatres in Los Angeles likely opening shortly as well, [and] blockbuster movie titles are currently scheduled to be released in significant quantity in the coming few months,” Aron said in a press release. “Taking these facts together, we have reason to be optimistic about AMC’s ability to get to the other side of this pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzxzy5"&gt;As noted in AMC’s earnings, part of the reason that AMC is still able to push forward and Aron feels optimistic is because of capital raised throughout 2020 and 2021. Add in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;newfound love from retail traders&lt;/a&gt; (similar to what happened with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop in late January&lt;/a&gt;), and AMC’s stock price has also somewhat rebounded over the last several weeks. Now, with announcements from President Joe Biden that nearly every American should be able to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/politics/biden-merck-johnson--johnson-vaccine/index.html"&gt;receive their vaccination by May 2021&lt;/a&gt;, studios are looking to get their blockbusters out in theaters again and AMC is hoping to bring as many moviegoers in as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFiX8u"&gt;There are still a lot of questions on the table. How has the irrevocably shortened theatrical window, brought on by companies with major studios like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355563/mulan-disney-plus-streaming-exclusive-cost-own-movies-theaters"&gt;NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia, ViacomCBS, and Disney&lt;/a&gt; possibly harmed AMC’s overall business? Will people want to rush into theaters by the summer? Could something else happen that delays everything reopening en masse once again? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsnSQj"&gt;For now, Aron is optimistic — at least in front of his company’s shareholders, investors, and analysts. The CEO will say more about the business and industry at large on the company’s earnings call this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly denies Parler’s App Store appeal, citing derogatory terms and ‘Nazi symbols’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP8YutyzG6d7B9X6LQEDp11Oglw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944888/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9cLIw"&gt;Apple has reportedly denied social media company Parler’s bid to reenter the iOS App Store, saying its platform hasn’t addressed problems with offensive content. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported the news earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, quoting a message reportedly sent on February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVsGFX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple said that Parler’s &lt;a href="https://legal.parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf"&gt;latest community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; still didn’t meet its standards. “Simple searches reveal highly objectionable content, including easily identified offensive uses of derogatory terms regarding race, religion and sexual orientation, as well as Nazi symbols,” it reportedly told Parler. “For these reasons your app cannot be returned to the App Store for distribution until it complies with the guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUzW2M"&gt;Parler’s guidelines ban threats, spam, and some other categories of content. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;right-wing-friendly network’s&lt;/a&gt; policies remain permissive compared to other social platforms, and its stated goal is that “removing users or user-provided content be kept to the absolute minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6lPLq"&gt;That strategy has put it at odds with several major companies. Apple and Google both banned its app from their mobile stores in January, following the January 6th mob attack on the US Capitol. And Amazon took the site offline by suspending its web hosting agreement, saying representatives had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;raised concerns about violent threats&lt;/a&gt; preceding the attack. Parler responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;filing suit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, although it has since relaunched on a different hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqLfmI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also reports that Parler cut ties with its last three iOS app developers alongside four other employees. The company still maintains an Android app that can be side-loaded from outside Google’s Play Store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;its site relaunched&lt;/a&gt; on February 15th. Parler and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nyan Cat’s creator is running an event to sell memes like Bad Luck Brian and Keyboard Cat as NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPRG7VIyYHqDAwUoZ2U7UzE2aek=/0x151:892x746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944793/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_10.01.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Kyle Craven&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DrYbxT"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;selling Nyan Cat as an NFT&lt;/a&gt;, its creator, Chris Torres, has found himself working on an even bigger event: a week-long series of auctions where classic memes are being sold on the blockchain by their original creators. Torres calls the event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/withFND/status/1369098514773381120?s=20"&gt;Memeconomy&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s hoping it’ll bring both recognition to the meme creators, as well as to the NFT space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pbr7Zh"&gt;The memes involved should be recognizable if you were on the internet in the early 2010s. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oGxggC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bad-luck-brian"&gt;Bad Luck Brian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sMRgDl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/coughing-cat"&gt;Coughing Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JsfsmJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaA_cs4WZHM"&gt;Kitty Cat Dance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vBP3cd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/scumbag-steve"&gt;Scumbag Steve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gg1re"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ"&gt;The Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/grumpy-cat"&gt;Grumpy cats&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lp7mEC"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/me-gusta"&gt;Me Gusta face&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wYG4yB"&gt;There will also be an auction of a new meme: a crossover between Twerky Pepe (a popular NFT creator) and the classic Nyan Cat. (Have you ever wanted to see thicc Nyan Cat? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PRguitarman/status/1368995286434127877?s=20"&gt;Now you can.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1zSYO"&gt;The event is already under way, and so far the first meme, Bad Luck Brain, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/badluckbrian/bad-luck-brian-4263"&gt;sold for just over $37,000&lt;/a&gt;. Coughing Cat is currently up for auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oorpn9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czbleJ"&gt;While the memes are mostly from the same era, Torres says that it’s not on purpose. “Honestly there was no real agenda” when it came to the selection of memes, he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that the original meme creators had contacted him independently. He says that he won’t be making any money off the auctions themselves, he just wanted to help get the creators set up so they could get “proper recognition” after “10 plus years without [it].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqMKT8"&gt;While NFTs are supposed to validate ownership, there’s no guarantee that the person creating an NFT owns the artwork they’re selling. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/03/people-are-now-making-nfts-out-of-artworks-and-tweets-without-permission/"&gt;artists talking about how their work has been stolen&lt;/a&gt; and NFT-ized, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GiphyComms/status/1369442632649310210?s=20"&gt;Giphy has tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it was looking into user content being used by NFT sites. Torres knows it’s an issue and said that he made sure that everyone he talked to about NFTs was both the actual creator of the meme and actually held the rights to it. He also said that meme theft wasn’t a new problem: “sometimes you look over and there’s a company that has your picture on a shirt and they’re making millions of dollars without even talking to you about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STrRyn"&gt;In the short term, the Memeconomy could put some cash (well, crypto) in the pockets of creators and open the doors for them to show off some recent work, if they have any. It could also work to build a community — finding friends through the process of organizing the Memeconomy event and through interactions in the NFT space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJljAt"&gt;In the long term, though, Torres thinks the meme NFTs will become collectables, and that “eventually somebody’s gonna want to have all of them” and it’ll “be a big fight to own all the memes whenever that time comes.” He said he “can’t wait to see that like a VR room with all the memes all displayed, that’s like… that would be awesome, like a grand collection of memes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s search bar was spacing out in many web browsers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-xnAZL7eBG_Jd2YnUS4U-bO5jU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944035/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3FtxzF"&gt;So this was a weird one: depending on the browser you’re using, your space bar may not have worked in the YouTube.com search bar for a little while today. Pressing it would make absolutely nothing happen, so your YouTube searches ended up being one long string of words. The bug seemed to be around for an hour, based on when people started sounding off about it on Twitter, but as of 3:50PM ET, the site appeared to be working correctly again on all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWb5EZ"&gt;The bug affected the desktop site, but only browsers that aren’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;based on Chrome. Firefox wouldn’t take spaces in Windows, macOS, or even Android if you requested the desktop version of the website. Safari on iPhones worked as normal, but the problems showed up on Safari on iPad — probably because iPads request the desktop site, too. Asking for the mobile version immediately fixed it there, and requesting the desktop site on an iPhone immediately broke spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxO3If"&gt;The good news is that the lack of spaces probably didn’t affect your YouTube experience much — it’s very good at understanding your intent even on long, relatively obscure searches with a bunch of words smashed together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc_-A8Cw3uRxM_L_wNGgwH1Hyh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360288/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_11.12.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s search algorithm was still able to figure it out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s00fKw"&gt;There was also another, &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more annoying bug: if you were trying to watch a video and type in the search bar at the same time, your keystrokes would end up acting as shortcuts. Pressing the space bar wouldn’t do anything in the search bar, but it would pause your video. Your “T” might show up in the search bar, but it also switched my video into theater mode. This issue is also fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHusqasoK2f1jz8XBtrGrn3z3cs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360387/YTBug_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typing in the search bar made many awful things happen on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sKc0cx"&gt;YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the issue now appears to be fixed. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Ma6x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 10th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the bug appears to have been fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s new hockey deal will see over 1,000 NHL games stream on ESPN Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Winnipeg Jets v Toronto Maple Leafs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2b39uX6l5hPd81ou3Okebe4gDDw=/0x6:4200x2806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944447/1306372719.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Claus Andersen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nzi3W"&gt;Disney and the NHL have just signed a massive new TV rights deal for the next seven years that will see ESPN and ESPN Plus become key places to watch and stream hockey games, starting with the upcoming 2021-2022 season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcQRhB"&gt;It’s the first time that ESPN will offer NHL hockey games since its previous deal expired in 2005, and this time streaming — particularly, ESPN Plus streaming — is a huge part of that deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZjtZh"&gt;ESPN Plus is effectively replacing NHL.TV as the NHL’s out-of-market streaming service, with over 1,000 games each season available for fans to stream. ESPN and ABC will also get 25 exclusive national regular-season games each season, while 75 games a year will be exclusive to ESPN Plus and Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGXckr"&gt;Additionally, ABC will get exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Final for four of the seven years, with the option to simultaneously broadcast those finals games on ESPN Plus and other linear ESPN networks. Furthermore, ABC and ESPN together will get to broadcast half of the NHL playoffs each season, too. (Specifically, Disney’s networks will get one of the Conference Final series and half of all the first round and second round games each year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Popl2M"&gt;The new NHL deal marks one of the biggest expansions yet for ESPN Plus when it comes to offering live sports from one of the major North American leagues, and it instantly makes the service a must-have for hockey fans across the US. The NHL deal will also offer a new wave of live sports on Hulu, thanks to the 75 games that will be exclusively broadcast on Hulu and ESPN Plus (which, unlike the other ESPN Plus games, will be available to all Hulu subscribers whether they subscribe to ESPN Plus or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlX5jc"&gt;The news comes just as Disney is &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/espn-plus-launches-hulu-1234927368/"&gt;rolling out a larger integration&lt;/a&gt; for ESPN Plus subscribers to be able to access that additional sport content within Hulu itself, which should help make it even easier for subscribers of both of those services to find the newly added NHL games when they debut this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpkkoM"&gt;ESPN Plus alone costs $5.99 per month, or it can be bundled alongside Hulu with ads and Disney Plus for $13.99 per month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I guess I have to watch ads everywhere on my $1,500 LG TV now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9a-td2wJMV9A1q2HrIMY3G_-Sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944432/DSCF3184.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nSl5e"&gt;This afternoon, I was updating the streaming apps on my 2020 LG CX OLED TV, something I do from time to time, but today was different. Out of nowhere, I saw (and heard) an ad for Ace Hardware start playing in the lower-left corner. It autoplayed with sound without any action on my part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ltzf2Q"&gt;Now I’m fully aware that it’s not unusual to see ads placed around a TV’s home screen or main menu. LG, Samsung, Roku, Vizio, and others are all in on this game. We live in an era when smart TVs can automatically recognize what you’re watching, and TV makers are building nice ad businesses for themselves with all of the data that gets funneled in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l78Tro"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just got served a legit commercial while updating the apps on my LG OLED TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This isn’t the future I signed up for. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TmQflsCxsl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TmQflsCxsl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Welch (@chriswelch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswelch/status/1369733357756686349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f05LaU"&gt;But this felt pretty egregious even by today’s standards. A random, full-on commercial just popping up in LG’s app store? Is there no escape from this stuff? We’re just going to cram ads into every corner of a TV’s software, huh? Imagine if an autoplay ad started up while you were updating the apps on your smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4rsTQ"&gt;The Ace spot wasn’t particularly annoying — it was over in 15 seconds — nor did it feel targeted at me or creepy. It’s really the placement that feels like a step too far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwP49d"&gt;This stuff can come off as invasive, but it’s also partially what’s steadily brought the prices down on even high-end TVs. I got this 55-inch CX on sale for like $1,400, and it’s pretty much the best TV on the market for next-gen gaming. But even if this beautiful panel came cheaper than it might have &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; ads plastered in random places, the level of ad infiltration on display here is still disheartening to see. LG recently announced it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;licensing webOS to other TV brands&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe the company is trying to see how far it can push things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3h9b"&gt;I guess I can always cut the TV’s internet connection and stick to a streaming stick or my Xbox Series X if the autoplay commercials keep popping up everywhere. Or maybe I can opt out of a setting somewhere to end the barrage. Some people aren’t bothered by this stuff, but if you are, check out &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/gn7fw5/ysk_if_you_own_a_samsung_smart_tv_that_has_ads/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;this excellent Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you fight back and block some of the domains that these TVs phone home to for their ads. A lot of people on Twitter also &lt;a href="https://pi-hole.net/"&gt;pointed me to Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt; as a fix. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gnosia is like a single-player Among Us for the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Ns2e_IP3H-aElBO-R0vZQcXKhA=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944339/01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xODgVb"&gt;Deduction games like &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;are exciting in part because of the human element — finding those signs that someone is lying, or doing your best to conceal your true identity while everyone scrutinizes you. The experience changes dramatically depending on who you’re playing with and how committed they are to their role. That’s what makes G&lt;em&gt;nosia&lt;/em&gt; so intriguing. The core idea is the same, as you’re either trying to suss out who the enemy is or disguise yourself as one. But there’s a huge difference: in &lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; you play entirely by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9NMZv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as a deduction game transformed into a visual novel. You play as a crew member on a spaceship, one that has been infected by an alien race known as the gnosia. While everyone looks human (well, except for the talking dolphin), one or more is actually an alien who wants nothing more than to kill the rest of the crew. The gnosia only attack at night, and each day the crew will hold a vote on who is most suspicious; the person chosen will then be placed in a cold sleep in hopes of preventing a death. This process continues until either the threat has been eliminated or the gnosia take over the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgQwlS"&gt;So how do you figure out if a computer-controlled character is lying? These voting sequences make up the heart of &lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt;, and they consist of a lot of dialogue. Before actually voting, everyone will voice their opinions and concerns. Some of the crew will have specific roles — like a doctor who can tell if someone is actually a gnosia — but of course they could be lying about that as well. Your job is to pay close attention to what people say, as well as how often, to figure out the truth. Are they constantly trying to divert blame elsewhere? Are they suspiciously quiet? At the same time, you have to be careful not to draw too much attention to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KNCtW-TRsWyGrvqswMwSCNkRuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360142/03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QUMDuF"&gt;One of the more interesting narrative twists employed by developer Petit Depotto in &lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; is that you and the rest of the crew relive the same day over and over. The variables change each loop, including your own, essentially randomizing things. Sometimes you’re aiming to save everyone, other times you’re plotting as a gnosia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzpXiJ"&gt;On the one hand, this leads to a lot of repetition. You’ll be reading through the same lines of dialogue regularly and living through essentially the same day more than 100 times. But the game does a good job of slowly introducing new elements to make things interesting. It’ll take many loops before you have the ability to calm everyone with some small talk or form alliances with other characters. Eventually, more roles are introduced, including a second alien type bent on destroying the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoRO22"&gt;The loop mechanic can get tedious, but it’s also integral to the story the game is trying to tell. Every time you start over, you learn just a little bit more about the characters, the gnosia, and the mystery of the loop itself. At a certain point I stopped even trying to “win” during the votes and instead experimented with new techniques in hopes of uncovering more clues. There’s even some RPG-like progression, as you can improve your skills across loops; I focused primarily on stealth and charisma, so that people wouldn’t notice me much but would always listen to me when they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5No4v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t quite replicate the experience of playing with real people, but it’s not really trying to. Instead, the game uses the framework of social titles like &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; as a frame for its sci-fi horror story. After about 20 loops, I was hooked and pushing forward through the same routine like a detective in search of any clue I could find. And if I fail? Well, there are plenty of more chances to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjeZI1"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Gnosia &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
