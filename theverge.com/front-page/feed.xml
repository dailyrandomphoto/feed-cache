    <title>Twitch warns streamers another wave of copyright strikes is coming</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kLw43B24Xf6m8_LWSyXS3YRK-NM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357719/acastro_190812_1777_twitch_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMLK4H"&gt;Twitch has received a “batch” of new takedown notices from music publishers over copyrighted songs in recorded streams (known as VODs), the company said in an email to streamers today. The notice may be worrying for some streamers who were affected by the waves of takedowns that hit last year, because if a user gets three copyright strikes on their channel, they will be permanently banned from the platform, according to Twitch’s policies. With this advance warning, it seems Twitch is trying to get ahead of a sudden flurry of takedowns and give streamers some time to remove potentially offending VODs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49EQjd"&gt;“We recently received a batch of DMCA takedown notifications with about 1,000 individual claims from music publishers,” Twitch said in an email Friday, which was sent to a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer. “All of the claims are for VODs, and the vast majority target streamers listening to background music while playing video games or IRL streaming.” Twitch believes the notifications were automated and warns more are likely coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96hfo7"&gt;If you’ve bounced around Twitch streams before, you’ve probably heard music in the background of many of them. A lot of that music is copyrighted, which leads to situations like these mass takedowns when the music industry wants to get paid. In Friday’s email, Twitch noted that the only way to avoid DMCA (or Digital Millennium Copyright Act) strikes is to not stream copyrighted material in the first place, and said that if a streamer does have unauthorized content in their VODs or clips, “we strongly recommend that you permanently delete anything that contains that material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eIVQRk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DMCA takedowns first became a major Twitch issue last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xebZ0g"&gt;DMCA takedowns first became a major issue for streamers last year. In May, many streamers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284287/twitch-dmca-copyright-takedowns-clips-controversy-broken-system"&gt;were blindsided&lt;/a&gt; by sudden takedown requests, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-notices-riaa-copyright"&gt;and in October&lt;/a&gt;, following another wave of copyright notices, Twitch took the step of deleting offending content. At the time, Twitch offered limited tools to streamers to manage content in response to the takedowns, compounding the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWPxab"&gt;The company apologized for how it handled the situations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560913/twitch-streamers-dmca-copyright-tools-apology"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it received a significantly higher number of music-related DMCA notifications starting last May than it ever had before. The company also promised to release better tools to help streamers manage their old content, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335929/twitch-dmca-vod-mass-delete-copyright-strike-dmca"&gt;followed through on that promise in March&lt;/a&gt;. And for streamers who want to play rights-cleared music in the background of their streams, Twitch offers a product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495243/twitch-soundtrack-streaming-music-soundcloud-distrokid-facebook-gaming"&gt;called Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, which it released worldwide in beta &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/09/30/introducing-soundtrack-by-twitch-rights-cleared-music-for-all-twitch-creators/"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Memorial Day sales happening now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGSdFyIHYKHdYolpTFgi2Bb_6A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357654/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Our favorite smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 6, is $70 off at multiple retailers this weekend. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCrwEW"&gt;Memorial Day weekend has officially arrived. Numerous retailers, including GameStop and Walmart, have already kicked off their Memorial Day sales online, offering customers a chance to save on a variety of electronics ahead of the three-day weekend. The holiday remains a great way to save on mattresses and camping equipment — it’s the unofficial start to summer, after all — but if you’re a gamer or prefer electronics over home goods, there are plenty of bargains to be had on headphones, TVs, and games throughout the long weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4MxBJ"&gt;We’ve seen discounts on many of these items before, sure, but if you’re still looking for a good deal, it’s hard to go wrong with the highlights below. Also, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; now reportedly set for June 21st and 22nd (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there’s a good chance some of these items may make a return in the near future. Then again, no promises.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cybertruck patent applications show off UI, solar bed cover, ‘armor glass’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kF8tgyWg-e7z4VuMBVkfuwxmV5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357449/sokane_191112_3807_8517.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6T8gkP"&gt;New patent applications submitted by Tesla in 2020 but published Thursday have revealed a bit more information about the Cybertruck, which is currently slated to start shipping at the very end of this year or in early 2022. One includes (in rather grainy detail) a bunch of screenshots of the new UI Tesla has been working on. Another details how the company plans to integrate solar panel tech onto the retracting tonneau cover for the truck bed — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-solar-roof-option-add-range/"&gt;something CEO Elon Musk said might be an option&lt;/a&gt;. And there even appears to be an application for what could be Tesla’s so-called “armor glass,” which memorably failed during an onstage demo in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui8Xpc"&gt;We’ve seen glimpses of Tesla’s new user interface before, at the Cybertruck reveal event and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/28/tesla-head-ui-leaves-leaks-unreleased-cybertruck-fsd-images/"&gt;when the company’s head of UI left earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20210156705.PGNR."&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546177/cybertruck_ui.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) — which has to do with how the UI will change in different situations — shows off how Tesla may ultimately display some features specific to the Cybertruck. For instance, one screen shows what the Cybertruck’s screen may look like when you’re trying to hook up a trailer to the tow hitch. A more off-road focused screen shows the truck’s real-time pitch and roll. A new “Today” screen shows a split-window view of a calendar, a “news” section, and other UI elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hb8hLm"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" title="Cybertruck UI patent application" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/509712726/content?start_page=1&amp;amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;amp;access_key=key-xcOSMplD8yoeHPbeTEAu" tabindex="0" data-auto-height="true" data-aspect-ratio="0.7729220222793488" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p style="   margin: 12px auto 6px auto;   font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;   font-style: normal;   font-variant: normal;   font-weight: normal;   font-size: 14px;   line-height: normal;   font-size-adjust: none;   font-stretch: normal;   -x-system-font: none;   display: block;"&gt;&lt;a title="View Cybertruck UI patent application on Scribd" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F509712726%2FCybertruck-UI-patent-application%23from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22456878%2Ftesla-cybertruck-patent-applications-ui-armor-glass-tonneau-cover" style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cybertruck UI patent applic...&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title="View seanokane's profile on Scribd" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fuser%2F273808991%2Fseanokane%23from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22456878%2Ftesla-cybertruck-patent-applications-ui-armor-glass-tonneau-cover" style="text-decoration: underline;" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seanokane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fW1bfB"&gt;The solar tonneau cover &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20210155086.PGNR."&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546168/cybertruck_tonneau_cover.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), meanwhile, offers a helpful side view of exactly how Tesla plans to roll the thing up when the bed is open, as well as how the sections will connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwTpnW"&gt;The most curious one may be the “durable glass for vehicle” &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20210154980.PGNR."&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546163/cybertruck_glass.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), though. While Tesla filed it on the same day as these other Cybertruck patent applications, it doesn’t explicitly mention the truck, and instead includes an image of a more generic Tesla vehicle. That said, one of the inventors is engineer Rosie Mottsmith, who originally helped develop the “armor glass” &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-engineer-shares-why-she-destroys-things-for-work-2018-2"&gt;for Tesla’s Semi truck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9oYsn"&gt;The application describes something that sounds similar to Corning’s Gorilla Glass. Tesla describes a glass comprised of three layers — an outer one, an inner one, and an adhesive interlayer. The external layer is 2mm to 5mm thick and made of borosilicate. The internal layer is 0.5mm to 1.1mm thick and is made of aluminosilicate. Corning uses both materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVwGvi"&gt;Tesla says the goal is to give the resulting glass sandwich “at most a 10% chance of failure with an impact of 2 J.” In a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546210/CGG_PI_Sheet_Interior_Architecture.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; describing an older spec of Gorilla Glass, Corning rates a 1.5mm thick piece failing at an impact of about 3.5 J. It achieved that by dropping a half-kilo steel ball. Now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation"&gt;where have I heard that before&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Backyardigans are going viral on TikTok and it’s about time </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IrXMElfOVaxwaPE4v5XyZxhNjQg=/84x0:996x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357207/backyardigans.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Uniqua, Pablo, Tasha, Tyrone, and Austin, The Backyardigans | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Backyardigans-Season-3/dp/B001V52RZE" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="whLQfu"&gt;When you are a parent, you quickly learn that your kids will inevitably get into shows or videos or learn songs that slowly chip away at your sanity because you will hear them over and over and over. Anyone who knows what “Baby Shark” is will know exactly the kind of hellscape I’m talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMKOoe"&gt;But once in a while, a kids’ show comes into your family’s life and you miss it when your kid ages out of it — like &lt;em&gt;Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;. For our family, that show was &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt;; my now-teenager voraciously watched episodes of the show that ran on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013 (we watched the DVDs), and would actually get up and dance when the music started. We looked forward to new episodes about the hijinks of Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin, because each episode had a different musical theme, with original songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQIKea"&gt;Two favorites were the Motown-themed “News Flash”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with a song about corn that I still hear whenever someone mentions the vegetable, and “Catch That Butterfly” which was basically a Rodgers-and-Hammerstein-themed operetta.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lhLWu"&gt;So the newfound appreciation for one &lt;em&gt;Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; song in particular that has taken over a corner of TikTok makes me extremely happy and renewed my belief that Gen Z is the best generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ea08e"&gt;It started with Merlysha Pierre, 19, of Miami, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/backyardigans-tiktok-castaway"&gt;who told &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@swagsurfff/"&gt;started posting TikTok videos&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans &lt;/em&gt;because she was concerned that younger kids didn’t know about the show or its songs. One of the songs she posted was about the bossa-nova-themed “Castaways,” which inspired many other TikTokers to do their own versions, leading to the song &lt;em&gt;charting on Spotify&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chartdata/status/1394627160233676800?s=20"&gt;going number one on its global viral chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buXSff"&gt;“Castaways” also caught the eye of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkp4xDOwqqJD7sSM3xdUiQ"&gt;music theory YouTuber Adam Neely&lt;/a&gt;, who gave a little &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2007/tv/news/the-backyardiga-21849/"&gt;backstory about just how much&lt;/a&gt; went into each &lt;em&gt;Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; episode, from hiring musicians and dancers (honestly, I had an inkling that every episode of this show had to be a major production in its own right but no idea just how major) and broke down “Castaways” as a piece of music, calling it a masterpiece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1yQh9a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uVAGjfFmFkw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epPsxj"&gt;Every episode of &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; had a Pablo freak-out (he was arguably the show’s main character), and each one of the characters got to “star” in an episode from time to time and deal with a problem they were struggling with in “real” life through play (and song). The predictability was soothing and the show wasn’t preachy. It was also fun to watch because the writers included plenty of inside jokes for the parents tuning in — we usually watched an episode pre-bedtime when my son was little, and it was extremely pleasant to drift off to whatever the kids were singing about that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpPnPV"&gt;Director Barry Jenkins also recently discovered &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt;, giving his thoughts in this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BarryJenkins/status/1391266842589626373?s=20"&gt;very sweet Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; about the show. He wished a happy Mother’s Day to the show’s creator &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janice_Burgess"&gt;Janice Burgess&lt;/a&gt; (truly, a hero. Also a Pittsburgher!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k3XczB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy Mother's Day to Janice Burgess, award-winning creator of the wonderful BACKYARDIGANS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know whether Ms. Burgess has children of her own, but she very clearly helped raised a whole lotta y'all's kids with this most fantastic show, so... a salute to her   &lt;a href="https://t.co/96ZqvUrjX6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/96ZqvUrjX6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Barry Jenkins (@BarryJenkins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BarryJenkins/status/1391472006420328450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YwdhuF"&gt;So now, a six-year-old song from a children’s show is making the rounds once again, which is adorable and amazing. I may dust off the DVD player this weekend and watch a few episodes for a good Mom Cry; it looks like the show is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Backyardigans-Season-3/dp/B001V52RZE?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-backyardigans%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458399%2Fthe-backyardigans-viral-tiktok-castaways-music-youtube" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streaming on Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you’re not as old-school as me and prefer a slightly more modern experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlnT4H"&gt;In any event, I hope all this renewed appreciation for &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; leads to a new generation of kids discovering the depth and charm of a show about five kid friends (a penguin, a moose, a hippo, a kangaroo, and a Uniqua) who played in the backyard and sang songs and did dances until it was snack time. &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; is a nice respite for kids of any age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEcw0T"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Mars helicopter had a midair brain fart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/26xJkzEBZJ8zkzjxcvSXWJWVxIo=/0x25:640x452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69356609/May_28_2021_09_27_54.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tr7jo4"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter ended its sixth flight test on Mars earlier than planned last week after bugging out mid-flight, the rotorcraft’s chief pilot wrote in a blog post on Thursday. The four-pound mini helicopter was aiming to fly farther than any of its previous excursions to test out its scientific reconnaissance capabilities, as the latest trial in an extended test campaign to demonstrate a new mode of transportation on another world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHMm0"&gt;Last Saturday, Ingenuity powered up and rose 33 feet from the Martian surface to travel a distance of roughly two football fields along a preprogramed flight path, all the while snapping photos of a “region of interest” on Mars during flight. As it buzzed along at about nine miles per hour toward the end of the first 150-meter leg of its journey, a glitch in the helicopter’s navigation unit caused Ingenuity to suddenly lurch midair. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MrdGXfU3iAhuez1l4j1PRbt8hLI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545709/May_28_2021_09_24_37.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video from Ingenuity’s navigation camera shows the wobbling caused by a glitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bWNzxW"&gt;It was a “stressful flight” for the little copter, Håvard Grip, the chief pilot, said. “Ingenuity began adjusting its velocity and tilting back and forth in an oscillating pattern,” rattled over what Grip said were “phantom errors” that caused “roll and pitch excursions of more than 20 degrees, large control inputs, and spikes in power consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingenuity lands safely after a stressful flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q2jamx"&gt;Ingenuity’s sense of movement comes from two vital parts of its internal computer, stored in its tissue box-sized body that hangs underneath its twin-rotor system. The first part is an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that tracks how fast the rotor blades spin to calculate acceleration, which enables estimates of its speed, midair position, and location (relative to its starting point). The second instrument is a tiny, ground-facing, black-and-white camera that snaps 30 photos per second to give the helicopter a visual sense of where it is, tracking rocks and patterns on the ground as Ingenuity zips by. Those photos come with timestamps, so Ingenuity can precisely analyze movement over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52rGRy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We designed Ingenuity to tolerate significant errors without becoming unstable, including errors in timing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ojW72"&gt;All of that data converges in the helicopter’s navigation system to provide a sense of balance and awareness. Ingenuity’s flub occurred 54 seconds into flight when one of the black-and-white navigation images randomly disappeared, knocking the image pipeline out of order and rendering the timestamps on all subsequent images inaccurate. “From this point on, each time the navigation algorithm performed a correction based on a navigation image, it was operating on the basis of incorrect information about when the image was taken,” Grip explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3d1iH"&gt;The spoiled navigation data misled Ingenuity to believe it was making a series of flight errors, prompting harried attempts to overcorrect itself before a safety system kicked in to guide it calmly back to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zwRxjI1zcvrwBn9FPl1E6zRas00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545722/PIA24600.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite the glitch, Ingenuity captured this west-facing image 33 feet above the Martian surface as planned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ddVFQe"&gt;Ingenuity landed safely about 16 feet from its intended touchdown spot, partly because the helicopter’s navigation unit is designed to ignore navigation images during the landing process, when it nears altitudes of around three feet. Relying only on data from the IMU, none of the images with glitch-inducing timestamps affected Ingenuity’s landing. “We designed Ingenuity to tolerate significant errors without becoming unstable, including errors in timing,” Grip said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A21eI9"&gt;The helicopter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; on the Red Planet attached to the underbelly of NASA’s Perseverance rover, which landed at Mars’ Jezero Crater, a dried-out lake bed, on February 18th. Perseverance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt; Ingenuity on the Martian surface on April 4th, leaving it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;carry out the first powered flight&lt;/a&gt; on another world on April 19th. Just after its fourth flight, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412154/nasa-ingenuity-aces-fourth-flight-mars-advance-new-testing"&gt;opted to extend Ingenuity’s flight campaign&lt;/a&gt;, impressed with the helicopter’s stability and performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="po5GEl"&gt;A JPL spokesman said engineers are reviewing data from Ingenuity’s sixth flight and don’t yet know when it will carry out its seventh.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The places paving the way to 100 percent renewable energy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Burlington, Vermont has been running on renewable electricity since 2014&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L8h0xD"&gt;Shortly before Darren Springer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;interviewed for a job at the Burlington Electric Department (BED) in 2016, the city proudly &lt;a href="https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/2016_pmr_vfr.pdf"&gt;proclaimed&lt;/a&gt; that it would become a “net zero energy city” by 2030. That meant no more gas or oil to heat residents’ homes and swapping out gas-powered cars for electric vehicles and more public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="h8rvfl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s got to be one of the most ambitious goals anywhere”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GxQneH"&gt;“I said, that’s got to be one of the most ambitious goals anywhere in the country,” Springer, who is now BED’s general manager, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That was one of the things that drew me to this work at Burlington Electric.” Since then, he’s worked to get the city on track to meet that goal. And while the target might have been unheard of in 2016, it’s now just one early example of the splashy renewable energy aspirations that more and more governments seem to be dreaming up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXuDsH"&gt;As of September 2020, 452 cities and 22 regions had &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/news/commitments-to-net-zero-double-in-less-than-a-year"&gt;made commitments&lt;/a&gt; to slash and offset their planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions, reaching net-zero CO2 pollution by the middle of the century. It’s all part of a race to stop the worst effects of climate change from becoming reality, which scientists say requires the entire world to nearly completely gut greenhouse gas emissions by that deadline.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0e78A"&gt;President Joe Biden is setting the US on a path to run entirely on clean electricity by 2035. That’s not an easy target, considering renewables only make up about 20 percent of the country’s power mix today. Luckily, Biden, and other state and city leaders with similar aims, have roadmaps from communities like Burlington, Vermont that are already ahead. The city offers a glimpse into what a clean energy future might look like for the rest of the nation, what it might take to get there, and which potential pitfalls it would be best to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H84EJk"&gt;“Having such an ambitious goal encourages creativity and innovation because you have to find ways to scale up, to pilot different approaches, to try something [and] fail in some cases, and then evolve your approach,” Springer says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIVjCU"&gt;The city has largely tried to get its residents on board with its clean energy plans through carrots rather than regulatory sticks. It’s focused on incentives, like rebates for residents who install energy-efficient heat pumps. City leaders have gotten some &lt;a href="https://www.wcax.com/2020/12/11/burlington-city-council-push-to-reduce-fossil-fuels-and-turn-to-electric/"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; for tougher stances, like when the City Council proposed a change to Burlington’s city charter that would allow it to impart an “impact” fee on homes and buildings that still rely on fossil fuels for heating. Voters ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.burlingtonvt.gov/sites/default/files/Election%20Results%20-%20Questions%20SIGNED_1.pdf"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the measure this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Vermont Voters Prepare To Vote In Super Tuesday Primary" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m4ekScRUCIaS6m90F2UfSz7t3LI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544469/1209971135.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burlington, Vermont – March 2nd: A “VOTE HERE Tuesday” sign is placed outside Burlington Electric Department March 2nd, 2020 in Burlington, Vermont. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vCHRYk"&gt;Voters will have to approve proposed fees again if the charter change is approved by the state legislature. But if they do, it shows some of the distinct advantages the city has that helped it turn to renewable energy so early. Its residents, city leaders, and a local utility all aligned on environmental efforts. Since the 1960s, people have flocked to Vermont in search of an alternative way of life — often escaping big cities or looking for greener living. One of its most famous transplants is Green New Deal champion Senator Bernie Sanders, who moved there from New York City in 1964 and eventually served as Burlington’s mayor throughout the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4u8bG"&gt;“Environmental leadership began in the late ‘80s, and we have really been able to sustain that,” says current Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger. “You need just two things if you want to do this: you need the political will to forge this kind of climate emergency progress. And then secondly, you do need technical proficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZMoKHK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You need just two things if you want to do this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gm8sAM"&gt;For Burlington, its municipally owned utility is the technical arm fulfilling much of the political leadership’s aims on climate change. It was founded more than 100 years ago after residents got fed up with high rates from the previous privately owned utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSC3aE"&gt;“Burlington had a long history of local control, local management … People in the city are involved and know where their energy comes from,” says Jennie Stephens, director of Northeastern University’s School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs. “That is something that’s unique, that not all communities and cities have, that allows Burlington to be really creative and innovative early on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bstyUY"&gt;Today, the city’s control over the utility makes it much easier to enact changes without facing a power struggle. The city essentially manages everything from energy generation to distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAKSgy"&gt;For cities that get their power from investor-owned utilities, she says, “it’s this whole complicated, constant negotiation with the utility … the tendency with a lot of these organizations is to try to keep everything the same, because it’s worked and they’ve been making money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lp4S2D"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBg4GO"&gt;One of the biggest advantages for Burlington is that they have easy access to both water and wood. Over 30 percent of Burlington’s electricity comes from burning wood, much of it waste leftover from the region’s logging industry. Another 40 percent comes from hydropower, which made Burlington the first city to run on 100 percent renewable electricity in 2014. Wind provides another 25 percent. Just over 1 percent of Burlington’s electricity came from solar last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCintT"&gt;The city’s reliance on wood and water allows it to sidestep some of the infrastructure headaches that can come with solar and wind. Electricity grids were built to facilitate a constant flow of energy from fossil-fueled power plants. Those old grids don’t currently have the storage — aka batteries — built in to store energy for use when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine. Burning wood and spinning water turbines also generates a constant flow of energy, making it more compatible with the existing grid. Nationally, the transition to clean energy is going to require &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419206/smart-grid-renewable-energy-power-sector"&gt;a major grid upgrade to accommodate more intermittent sources of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8WuWF"&gt;Burning wood and damming up waterways have a smaller impact on the climate than fossil fuels. But they’re also more controversial than solar or wind. Larger, older dams are notorious for wrecking ecosystems. Wood-burning, meanwhile, comes with other pollutants that can affect air quality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ka21V5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cities looking to make renewable energy goals will need to find their own balance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvRBZ1"&gt;“It’s a balancing of different factors, you know. We want renewable energy, we want to mitigate impacts from different projects,” says Springer. “From all of the different literature that we’ve looked at, it’s far more beneficial to have renewables than to use fossil fuels.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vy1bI0"&gt;Cities looking to make renewable energy goals will need to find their own balance. They’ll also have to take into account who might be bearing the burdens of that transition whether it’s air pollution from burning biomass like wood, or some households seeing higher electricity bills from utilities shouldering the costs of building new energy infrastructure. “This transformation is an opportunity to invest in people and communities in very different ways. And it’s also a real risk if we don’t,” Stephens says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTjDMG"&gt;There’s been a reckoning within the mainstream environmental movement to ensure that the benefits of clean energy are felt equally, and that low-income households aren’t disproportionately saddled with the costs and burdens of an energy transition. Stephens points to New York state as a good example of finding equitable solutions: it plans to reach &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/6/20/18691058/new-york-green-new-deal-climate-change-cuomo"&gt;100 percent clean electricity by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and stipulated that 35 to 40 percent of the benefits from new climate and energy policy go to disadvantaged communities. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation is developing a 34-acre “regenerative community” on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jqMa5S"&gt;Moving beyond Burlington, there are more grassroots efforts to build equitable, green energy infrastructure. The nonprofit, Indigenous-led Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation is developing what it calls a “net-zero energy” community for members of the Oglala Lakota Nation on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. The goal is for the 34-acre development’s power to come completely from renewable energy, for now primarily solar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYrsQe"&gt;At the moment, the homes, apartment buildings, and community center that are part of the development still only get about half their power from solar. They haven’t been able to figure out the intermittency problem yet with solar, and batteries are still too costly. (Thunder Valley has also had setbacks from more extreme weather, like baseball-sized hail that actually broke through solar panels last year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbabG5"&gt;Thunder Valley recently put out a request for proposals on how to get its development the rest of the way to its goal. And in the meantime, it’s leaned on traditional building styles to make structures more energy efficient, like including large south-facing doors that allow more sunlight into homes to heat floors. Similar to Burlington, another strength is how involved residents are in crafting how the development progresses, says Chance Renville, a project manager at Thunder Valley. “Tribal members are really the designers and the ones shaping and making this place what it is,” says Renville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PtPNxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tribal members are really the designers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AOBX3f"&gt;“We’ve lived in harmony with Mother Earth for generations, and more recently we have gotten away from that,” says Renville. “But I think it’s important for us to really take a look at what we’re doing and how we can get back to living more sustainably.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfYj6Z"&gt;There’s no one-size-fits-all plan for moving communities to a more sustainable future. Communities and leaders will have to take stock of the strengths and resources each community already has — whether that’s traditional knowledge, strong civic participation, or existing policies and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bmM39J"&gt;“There are just so many good reasons to have an ambitious goal and to strive for it, even if it requires trial and error,” Burlington’s Springer says. “Even if it feels at first that it might be more than is achievable, I think we’re trying to prove that it can be achievable.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The AirPods Pro’s force sensor is a more comfortable way to control audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwoxfJvKR8bfojMWh8jqAzd5gvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69356058/vpavic_4603_20210525_0018_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WjhY2z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; cleverly solve one of the trickiest parts of earbud design with a unique button — even if it’s not technically a button at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKi4jL"&gt;Officially referred to as the “force sensor” (a title that makes the button sound far more interesting than it actually is), it’s technically nothing more than an indented portion of the AirPods Pro’s stems, with some fancy hardware that measures not just capacitive touch but also pressure. But the faux-buttons solve one of the most annoying things about earbuds: how to control them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SSF7c8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A smart solution for a more recent problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wF9nN8"&gt;The issue of controlling truly wireless earbuds is a relatively new one. Older in-ear headphones often included a row of buttons on their wires, which allowed for volume and playback controls to be placed in a spot that’s easy to reach and find. But in-ear wireless earbuds don’t leave a lot of space for buttons, joysticks, or control wheels to manipulate playback, forcing manufacturers to come up with alternate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ry-XASBpDsHpD2CY_IGMMPv1QD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539213/vpavic_4603_20210525_0020_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hQSlsa"&gt;Touch controls, employed by headphones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;regular AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, have emerged as the most common answer. Tap, double tap, or triple tap your earbuds, and you’ll be able to play, pause, and skip around your tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAjnnr"&gt;The problem, though, is that in-ear headphones — as the name suggests — are already nestled pretty firmly into your ear. And tap controls mean that you’re either shoving those earbuds further into your ear (painfully so, sometimes) or dislodging them entirely, at which point you’re risking loss or damage when your expensive buds plummet to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv9w0A"&gt;Apple avoids both of those problems with the force sensor. Instead of putting pressure on your ear, Apple has users squeeze the stem of the AirPod. It’s a far gentler movement that doesn’t move the earbud as much, reducing both the risk of discomfort and dislodging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyBe0o_QmVvM29cY0XkZl66-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539210/vpavic_4603_20210525_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EOET2D"&gt;Its controls are pretty similar to the other methods of headphone control: one squeeze to toggle play / pause, two to skip forward a track, and three to skip back. There’s also a fourth long press, which toggles the various noise cancellation modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0W4DZ"&gt;The whole design guides you through how to use them, too. The indented pad makes it clear where to press to activate the “button,” while the requirement for some slight force makes it hard to trigger unintentionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD1kZh"&gt;And while there’s no &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; haptic feedback from the force sensor, Apple does some masterful work in tricking your brain that there is, through clever clicking sound effects relayed through the earbuds to make it feel like you’re pressing a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga9LqW"&gt;The controls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458155/new-airpods-pro-2022-fitness-release-dates-report-design-features"&gt;might not be long for this world&lt;/a&gt; — Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022"&gt;rumored to be testing a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro that would remove the stem (and the force sensor) entirely. It’d be a disappointing change, given that the force sensor isn’t just a great control method; the AirPod stems are one of the more recognizable parts of the product, so much so that it’s the main thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;copycat designs&lt;/a&gt; tend to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhNoli"&gt;Is it a lot of engineering work for a relatively simple function? Undoubtedly. But it makes a crucial part of operating the AirPods a seamless, aesthetically pleasing, and comfortable process. And what more can you ask than that?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We have bigger problems than COVID-19’s origins  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RcYVtpSTwb531MQ_wmVSqFUQgnU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69356018/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGuT9W"&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic scales down in the United States, debates around the origins of the virus — and speculations that it came from a lab in China, not an animal — rumbled back to life. And they’re diverting attention to the wrong places. Focusing on where the virus came from is a distraction from the rest of the urgent work governments and health agencies around the world need to do in order to end this pandemic and prepare for the next one. We don’t need a consensus on the origins of COVID-19 in order to take steps to strengthen global public health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdK4Es"&gt;That doesn’t mean finding out where the coronavirus came from isn’t important. It’s one of the pieces of information that could &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fwe-still-dont-know-the-origins-of-the-coronavirus-here-are-four-scenarios&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458230%2Fcovid-origins-lab-leak-biden-vaccines-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;give us tools&lt;/a&gt; to prevent a similar situation from happening again. Saying that the coronavirus came from a lab rather than an animal is an extraordinary claim; it would require extraordinary evidence to be proven true. Both scenarios are still technically &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, even if a lab leak is &lt;a href="https://massivesci.com/articles/sars-cov-coronavirus-covid19-lab-leak-hypothesis/"&gt;far less&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/27/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask#many-scientists-welcomed-bidens-call-for-a-rigorous-inquiry-of-a-chinese-lab-but-they-said-the-theory-remained-unlikely"&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;. And there are &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1"&gt;serious scientists who are calling for a serious investigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGxiY9"&gt;After renewed attention — though, notably, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/05/27/wuhan-lab-theory-evidence/"&gt;little new data&lt;/a&gt; — on the theory that the outbreak started after the virus was accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/26/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that he’s asking United States intelligence agencies to redouble efforts to figure out the origins of the coronavirus. In 90 days, he wants to see a report “that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion” on how the virus jumped to humans, sparking the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvHZb1"&gt;Taking a methodical, dispassionate approach to tracking the origins of the coronavirus could take many times longer than Biden’s proposed 90 days, assuming there’s ever conclusive proof at all. It took around 14 years to figure out where the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07766-9"&gt;SARS virus&lt;/a&gt; came from. Tracing the origins of the 1918 flu pandemic took &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/1/05-0979_article"&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don’t know where Ebola outbreaks come from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vt9Du4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientists &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don’t know where Ebola outbreaks come from&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhiovB"&gt;There are other things we could focus on that might not take quite as long and can provide sure results. Countries like the US could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/rich-countries-cornered-covid-19-vaccine-doses-four-strategies-right-scandalous"&gt;double down on efforts&lt;/a&gt; to distribute life-saving COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries. Wealthy countries snapped up the lion’s share of the doses —and so far, 85 percent of vaccinations have been given there. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, called it a “moral failure.” The pandemic is still an urgent threat in places &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-coronavirus-vaccine-coronavirus-pandemic-business-government-and-politics-2d5eab50c1ef8bd63b1a48331f4c3025"&gt;without enough shots&lt;/a&gt; for healthcare workers. If the virus is still spreading in those countries, the pandemic isn’t over. As long as it spreads, it can mutate and be a threat everywhere — even in places with high rates of immunization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSSMzl"&gt;The US could also turn inward, and take a full account of the ways in which our public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic went horribly wrong. We could focus on shoring up our public health infrastructure and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412046/hopsital-infrastructure-health-care-system-pandemic-coordination-covid"&gt;improving our hospital systems&lt;/a&gt; so they’ll hold up under a surge of sick people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeGeum"&gt;We could even use the time to take a look at lab safety practices. “Let’s stipulate that pandemics can result from natural spillovers or from laboratory accidents—and then let’s move along to implications,” Daniel Engber &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/chinese-lab-leak-hypothesis-coronavirus/619000/"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lab screw-ups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/31/7474365/after-several-bioharazous-screw-ups-the-cdc-hires-a-safety-chief"&gt;happen&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re scary. People are particularly spooked by research that alters viruses to make them deadlier or more transmissible, which is done in some US labs. Well before the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00210-5"&gt;experts questioned&lt;/a&gt; if there was enough oversight of those experiments. Even if a lab leak wasn’t involved in this particular pandemic, it might be worth strengthening policies around dangerous pathogens &lt;em&gt;anyhow&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PS8nkG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Finding the source of COVID-19 pandemic won’t bring back the nearly 600,000 people in the US who died from the disease&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tIf9kr"&gt;Finding the source of COVID-19 pandemic won’t bring back the nearly 600,000 people in the US who died from the disease. The virus itself isn’t the only reason why they’re gone — they died because the pandemic was bungled through a combination of bad leadership, poor communication, and decades of cuts to the country’s public health infrastructure. A viral outbreak is hazardous, but it only became such a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528752/election-2020-public-health-coronavirus-pandemic-trump-cdc"&gt;magnificent disaster&lt;/a&gt; because of how people responded to it. Figuring out how to prevent a future viral outbreak from turning into this scale of a disaster is a better use of our limited time and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5X0DuN"&gt;That so many people are quick to assume intentional wrongdoing or neglect led to the initial outbreaks of the virus, though, shows how much trust in public institutions eroded over the past year. It’s for a good reason: China &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; attempt to downplay the pandemic and is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/world/asia/wuhan-china-coronavirus.html"&gt;working to paint&lt;/a&gt; its COVID-19 response as a victory. There were mistakes from groups like the World Health Organization, which was slow to recognize the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00810-9"&gt;ventilation&lt;/a&gt;, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/27/cdc-latest-blunder-about-trust-not-masks/?utm_content=bufferd79c7&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter_organic"&gt;screwed up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206728/cloth-face-masks-white-house-coronavirus-covid-cdc-messaging"&gt;messaging&lt;/a&gt; around masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIjz0J"&gt;The terrifying mistakes made by public health officials, researchers, and politicians are things we should be honest about. We can take the fears that make people want to investigate the lab leak idea seriously. But we don’t need to know where the virus came from to deal with those issues — and they’ll be key to rebuilding trust, which we need for the next pandemic. Once the world is vaccinated, we should. But first, let’s try to keep as many people alive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBVjqp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ4FyH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISwgMe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phones to buy if you’re a phone enthusiast</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Come make bad decisions with us&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mWHafX"&gt;There are plenty of buying guides for figuring out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;best phone to buy&lt;/a&gt; at a given time, across a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;wide variety of prices&lt;/a&gt;. We have two of them, in fact. But if you’re a dyed-in-the-wool phone enthusiast, you don’t need a guide that’s going to give you the best rational recommendation. You need something that’s going to help you scratch your new gadget itch in the most satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwnkhO"&gt;I’m here for you because, well, I’m one of you. This is the internet’s premiere buying guide for phone enthusiasts. We’re not going to focus on practical, rational choices, nor are we going to concern ourselves with budgets. These are the dream phones, the ones you buy not as a utilitarian tool, but for the fun of playing with a new piece of tech that you’ll probably sell or trade in for a loss in six months. I’m not even going to single out a specific model that you should buy, because you’re likely buying a new phone every year (or maybe more!) anyway. This is all about throwing caution to the wind, diving deep into a hobby, and buying something you don’t need but absolutely want. Budgets be damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEMlHI"&gt;Grab your cargo shorts, we’re going shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HQWhbW"&gt;The best folding phone because you know you need one in your collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cyP7p8"&gt;Folding phones are the future, right? You can’t call yourself a Real Phone Enthusiast without one in your life. Hands down, the best folding phone you can buy right now is Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. It’s got everything you might want from a modern smartphone, but it also opens up into a tablet-sized screen that lets you put more than one app side-by-side or look at a giant version of Google Maps. It’s easy to justify because you can tell yourself that you will get SO MUCH WORK done on it, right after you finish watching that YouTube video. Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8bHVj"&gt;The Fold 2 costs more than most laptops, you have to baby it, and there’s a really good chance the screen will crack or break on you even if you are careful, but that’s just the price you have to pay to be on the bleeding edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jGK8Wn"&gt;The best iPhone for when you’re double-fisting an Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="odv92P"&gt;Look, I know that you know that everyone in the world has an iPhone and it’s the farthest thing from an “interesting” phone. But at the same time, it’s hard to ignore what Apple’s doing, and really, iMessage and the Apple Watch are pretty great. Lots of people carry an iPhone alongside an Android phone, and you could be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgHcF9"&gt;The best iPhone for doing this is the iPhone 12 Mini. It does everything its bigger siblings can do, but it can easily fit in a secondary pocket and isn’t a burden to carry around. The battery life is kinda lousy, but who cares, that’s why you have a second phone on you anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QAq06D"&gt;The best phone for seeing what this “gaming phone” trend is all about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsaub"&gt;Gaming phones are so hot right now (unless they’ve got a great cooling system) — it seems like a new model is released every three months. You can’t call yourself a true phone enthusiast without being up on this trend, and the best one to dip your toes into it with is the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUdoj9"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of features that can make any mobile accomplisher swoon. A massive battery. A ridiculously high refresh screen. An OLED screen on the back you can customize to show whatever you want. A bunch of accessories to make gaming better. 18GB of RAM! How could you not buy this phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BEGvDk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10520198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UxUeAC"&gt;The best phone for pretending you’re going to use a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="62OqLx"&gt;Writing on a phone screen with a pen is so cool! It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; futuristic and is just so natural. At least, it is for the first week until you forget about it and it never leaves the little garage built into the side of the phone again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYMIss"&gt;If you’ve been telling yourself that little “I’m gonna be a stylus person” lie, you need a phone that supports one and it’s hard to see buying anything other than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20. It’s got a low latency S Pen, a bunch of software features that can utilize the stylus, and all of the other bells and whistles of a modern smartphone, which means it works quite well long after you’ve forgotten about the stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ISjN0J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215736"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hZjFO7"&gt;The best phone for messing around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnkTF"&gt;Okay, I said I wasn’t going to recommend anything rational in this guide, but this is perhaps the recommendation that makes the most sense: if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;mess around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt; but don’t want to install it on your main phone, you should just buy a Google Pixel 4A. It’s only $350 (that’s just $20 more than it costs to fix a broken screen on an iPhone 12 Pro Max) and can work with Google’s latest and greatest software even before it’s released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QeuvA"&gt;You know the Android betas are going to be messy — battery life is going to be bad, there will be lots of bugs, certain apps might not work correctly — so you don’t want to put it on a device you actually need to rely on. Once the beta period is over, the Pixel 4A is a great device for experimenting with the aftermarket ROM world. Get a Pixel 4A and flash those ROMs to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrmHOI"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eiZDop"&gt;The best phone for making people go “Whoa, is that a phone?”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zcDQoO"&gt;As a phone enthusiast, you already know this harsh truth: the Microsoft Surface Duo is not a good phone. It has an old processor. The camera is worse than any iPhone of the past five years. The battery life is decidedly Not Great. It gets hot doing simple tasks. There are SO MANY software bugs. It’s got a generation-old version of Android. It doesn’t even support wireless charging or NFC payments! Oh yeah, and there’s that questionable build quality to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J93WFK"&gt;But there’s something undeniably cool about the Surface Duo, like it’s a device from the future coming here to bless us in the early 21st century. It’s so thin, it has two screens, the hinge is incredibly neat. Open it up in public and you’re sure to get someone to ask “wow, is that a phone?” which we all know is the ultimate goal here. You can then show them all of its cool features, right after it’s done rebooting itself for the fifth time that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qGH04z"&gt;The best phone for telling yourself that you don’t need an actual camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwPQXC"&gt;For years now we’ve been told that phone cameras are so good that you don’t need an actual camera. The iPhone 12 Pro Max might be the best example of that yet. It’s got a bigger sensor! It’s got three focal lengths! It can shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIhX55"&gt;At the end of the day, it’s still a phone camera and can’t really hold a candle to the image quality or creative control you get with a larger mirrorless camera. But hey, it’s fun to live in that lie and you can totally see the difference between the 12 Pro Max images and other phones. When you blow them up on a big screen. And zoom in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KwtDVn"&gt;The best phone for saying “you can’t get this in the US”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oAaPTd"&gt;Perhaps the ultimate phone flex is pulling a phone out of your pocket that nobody else is going to have. If you’re in the US, the Oppo Find X3 Pro is that phone. It’s got features you can’t get on any American phone and a design you won’t see everywhere, like a microscope camera and softly rounded camera bump. Sure, it won’t really work great on the cellular networks here, importing it is an expensive hassle, and you won’t have any warranty whatsoever. But just think of the envy on your friends’ faces when you tell them they can’t have this phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fsQZrc"&gt;The best phone for when you realize that Pixel phones aren’t great, but you don’t want a Samsung either&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LwpXZ"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones have such great software and then… mediocre everything else. Samsung phones have incredible hardware but are laden with heavy software and actual ads inside of the stock apps. The OnePlus 9 Pro splits that difference — it has software that’s similar to Google’s on hardware that’s virtually a Samsung with a different logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMwn3Y"&gt;The 9 Pro is just what the phone enthusiast ordered: a high-end, bells-and-whistles device with All Of The Specs but none of the cruft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yVVHIu"&gt;The best weekend phone for when you’re “disconnecting”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4j7b9k"&gt;Here comes the weekend, with all of its promises of relaxation and enjoyment. You don’t need a phone that’s going to make you more productive, you need something that’s going to slip into your pocket and won’t distract you with a colorful display unless you absolutely need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhFwR6"&gt;The Z Flip 5G is this phone. You can flip it closed to ignore it and then pop it open and have a full smartphone inside, complete with every feature you get on non-flippy phones. You’re making a compromise without &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; making a compromise, because we all know that you had no intention of actually disconnecting for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s Base Station Pro is back down to its lowest price this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nomad Base Station Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ouB28vF11kfIitzuE8R0bcLJsk0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69355891/cgartenberg_200824_4157_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Base Station Pro can recharge up to three devices simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MgYCFB"&gt;Memorial Day is Monday, May 31st, but many of the best deals are already kicking off. Stay tuned for an upcoming post that’ll show you everything that’s worth checking out on sale, whether you’re interesting in headphones, TVs, video games, or something else. Also, it’s worth keeping in mind that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; appears to be coming soon, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This hasn’t been confirmed yet by Amazon, but if you’re a Prime member, maybe go ahead and mark June 21st and June 22nd in your calendar. Until then, we’ve got some great deals highlighted below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lrqUb3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nEFFG"&gt;Nomad’s Base Station Pro is half off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FYlCvt"&gt;For those still looking to fill the Apple AirPower-shaped hole in their hearts, Nomad’s Base Station Pro is a wireless charging pad that makes for a pretty good alternative. It usually costs $200, but &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can get it right now for half that cost by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This deal will last through Saturday, May 29th at 11:59PM PT (2:59AM ET), if it doesn’t sell out first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XeSdTD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HreUgJ"&gt;The Base Station Pro can charge up to three devices at the same time wirelessly, and what’s even more appealing is that you don’t have to arrange them in a particular way on the pad. It has Aira FreePower charging coils inside, which, compared to traditional coil design, apparently allow for a better and more reliable charging connection. In the words of my colleague Chaim Gartenberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;who reviewed it in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, “There’s no hunting for a ‘sweet spot’ when placing devices on the Base Station Pro — just drop your phone, headphone case, or whatever other Qi device you’re charging on the leather surface, and it’ll charge.” You can also add a mount that lets you charge an Apple Watch for $5, though that requires using the charging cable that came with the Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ycL96ReSCqTu4B5KKt2LYthrg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21813016/cgartenberg_200824_4157_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Nnb34"&gt;If you place just an iPhone down on the Base Station Pro, it’ll recharge at up to 7.5W of power, but Android phones are limited to 5W. If you’re charging multiple Apple devices, you’ll also be limited to 5W wireless charging. The Base Station Pro isn’t compatible with the Google Pixel 5, however, or the Pixel Buds that include a wireless charging case, but it should work with most other wireless charging devices, including Samsung phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7gjkE"&gt;Nomad also recently improved on (but didn’t totally remedy) a major flaw of the Base Station Pro that didn’t arise until the iPhone 12 series phones launched. The iPhone 12’s MagSafe magnet caused problems for the Aira FreePower tech, which resulted in recharge times that were doubled in length compared to previous Qi-ready iPhones. However, &lt;a href="https://www.pntra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeDeals+&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fpages%2Ffreepower-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad recently released a firmware &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/pages/freepower-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; that shortens the recharge time, though charging an iPhone 12 series still takes longer than other phones on the Base Station Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9CMkjJ"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 is noticeably smaller than the iPhone 11." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQSBc8E-OX_DqbGoG66w5NH3d_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973523/vpavic_4243_20201017_0014.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pbcMBD"&gt;Apple’s 20W USB-C charger and cable are discounted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ceA0i4"&gt;At Daily Steals, you can save on a bundle that contains Apple’s 20W USB-C wall adapter and its USB-C to Lightning cable. Normally $40 for both directly from Apple, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-20w-usb-c-power-adapter-usb-c-to-lightning-cable-bundle%3Fvariant%3D39311427207255&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22456723%2Fnomad-base-station-pro-qi-charger-pad-playstation-gift-card-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them for just $15&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEUSBC&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want two, then you’ll save more. Double your cart quantity and your checkout price will only be $26.24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BCjXjY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qKOq3Eec2fMutHoT3_acry3TnjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174858/MilesMorales_PS5_Combat_Legal_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony / Insomniac Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LXWwAF"&gt;You can also save on a $50 PlayStation gift card&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh0il1"&gt;If you’re in the mood to check out another exclusive deal, digital storefront Eneba is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a sweet price cut on a $50 gift card to be used on either the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5. To claim the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals052821&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-50-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fjetpak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;visit Eneba, click “Buy Now”&lt;/a&gt;, and type in the offer code &lt;strong&gt;50USDVERGE&lt;/strong&gt;. The price should fall by a handful of bucks, and while the exact price might fluctuate, it won’t be more than $43 and change. This deal ends on May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
