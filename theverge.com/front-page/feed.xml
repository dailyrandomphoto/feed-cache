    <title>Twitch streaming is returning to the Xbox dashboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpAKfmxL6Pdg1slK5iHSiaJ7yk8=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70045961/twitchxbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFWdFf"&gt;Microsoft is bringing back Twitch streaming integration directly into the Xbox dashboard. Twitch first appeared directly integrated into the Xbox One dashboard in 2014, using the original Snap interface to allow players to stream directly to the service. Now it’s coming back into the Xbox Guide interface, with similar integration and webcam support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ZS4F"&gt;Alpha and Skip-Ahead alpha Xbox testers &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/25/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2111-211022-2000/"&gt;can access the new integration&lt;/a&gt; right now, and it’s simple to use. You can adjust game volume or microphone volume, include party audio from friends, and see a list of viewers and how long you’ve been streaming with an overlay on top of your games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DdvqTV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaRNtcaVSRQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vUbjR0"&gt;The Twitch integration also includes the ability to switch resolution and bitrates from 360p at 500kbps up to 1080p at 6500kbps. Microsoft is also supporting USB webcams, and most plug-and-play ones should work as a camera option for Twitch streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlGSu0"&gt;Twitch has had Xbox streaming support inside its own app, but integration into the dashboard is a welcome return after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384132/microsoft-xbox-one-snap-mode-feature-removed"&gt;removed its Snap feature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/894253OJn0w"&gt;Twitch integration&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. We’re expecting this new Twitch integration to be broadly released in the coming months, once Microsoft has fully tested it with Xbox testers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Xperia Pro-I is a camera first, 5G phone second</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHDzWh8aFvVwlO4-nGrsyIPPyl0=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70045819/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_01_fe5962e1c05b0527fc2f64dea00191f8_1.png.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFMkgo"&gt;Sony is ready to throw-down with a new camera-first 5G phone — the Xperia Pro-I — in the battle for smartphone camera supremacy. Less than 12-hours after the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s reviews started dropping online, and all the camera enthusiasts trying to determine whether the Pixel 6 Pro or the iPhone 13 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera, Sony wants to be in the mix with the Xperia Pro-I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk3hDL"&gt;The “I” in the Xperia Pro-I stands for imaging, which pays homage to Sony’s popular line of Alpha mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras and professional video cameras, rather than point-and-shoot camera model names like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII (Mark 7)&lt;/a&gt;. At least that’s what the Sony representatives who were briefing journalists ahead of this event told us. The star of the show is obviously this device’s camera technology, so it’s totally fair to think of the Xperia Pro-I as a camera that happens to come with a phone attached. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdm2oODa5ywRnuN5kYNCOXv_OA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956098/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_03_bf3834489e39e3e3a97099d54615d806.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s triple rear camera array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jMGXWd"&gt;After all, it’s notable for using a similar 1.0-type Exmor RS image sensor with phase detection AF (autofocus) that powers the RX100 VII, the preferred point-and-shooter of vloggers and tourists. This large 1-inch camera sensor enables “outstanding low light performance, high dynamic range, and beautiful bokeh,” according to Sony. However, &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/1641689739/sony-just-packed-a-1-stacked-cmos-sensor-into-the-xperia-pro-i-but-there-s-a-catch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DPReview&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that while this 1-inch sensor is 20 megapixels in total, the Xperia Pro-I only makes use of part of the sensor, meaning it outputs a 12-megapixel image on this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nWc1Y"&gt;While rare, Sony isn’t the first to include a 1-inch sensor in a phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439883/sharp-aquos-r6-japan-biggest-phone-camera-sensor-1-inch"&gt;Sharp’s Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; had one when it was announced earlier this year, as did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Panasonic’s CM1 from 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSN6M"&gt;Sony’s Xperia Pro-I has a total of three 12-megapixel cameras on the back (a main, ultrawide, and telephoto) and one 8-megapixel camera around its front. While these cameras seem low-resolution, the Sony representative was very eager to explain that they contain fewer but larger (2.4µm) pixels, where each pixel captures more details, more dynamic range and greater depth of field. The company seems confident it doesn’t need to chase higher megapixel counts like its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTrH0u"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I’s rear cameras use three glass lenses from Zeiss. Its main 24mm lens has dual aperture (f2.0/f4.4) that allows you to change the depth of field more quickly to create “authentic bokeh,” rather than the digital software-created bokeh effect that other phones produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN8CVaZDvtYb372NgLNAF0sld_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956097/thumbnails_large__default_upload_bucket_01_fe5962e1c05b0527fc2f64dea00191f8_1.png.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s display has a 21:9 aspect ratio, making this a narrow, tall device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="coBHFC"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I includes the same BIONZ X imaging processor found in Sony’s A9 professional mirrorless camera for sports, which allows it to take up to 20fps in burst shots similar to Sony’s recent smartphones like the Xperia 1 III. This is the rare smartphone camera that is fast at autofocus, and capable of real-time eye tracking (humans and animals) in both stills and videos. Speaking of videos, Sony claims that the Xperia Pro-I is is the first smartphone in the world that can record 4K videos at 120fps and be able to preserve all 120 frames. While other smartphones can record 4K videos, they often compress the frames into a smaller file, which means you won’t have as much control in post-production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZsaSi"&gt;On the phone side of the Xperia Pro-I, it has a 6.5-inch 21:9 3840x1644 OLED display, with 120Hz refresh rate, at a relatively skinny 21:9 aspect ratio. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor, and unlocked models should work on most 4G networks in the world, as well as sub-6GHz 5G. There’s 12GB RAM, 512GB of internal storage, a microSDXC card slot, and a 4,500mAh battery which can be fast-charged at 30W. Despite its premium and modern specs, the Xperia Pro-I still has a 3.5mm audio jack for creators who need to plug in a mic, and a strap hole to slide in a wrist strap for security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxwYGX"&gt;The Xperia Pro-I will ship in December 2021 for a whopping $1,800 (£1,599). That’s the same price as Samsung’s flagship foldable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;, and $200 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673600/iphone-13-1-tera-storage-memory-price-apple"&gt;1TB model of Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $1,599. It’s also more than a Sony’s $1,300 RX 100 VII, and the same price as the $1,800 full-frame Sony A7C. But Sony’s aim with the Xperia Pro-I is to provide a device that can do it all, combining the quality of a dedicated point-and-shoot camera with a thin (0.35-inch) 5G phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpuHTb"&gt;Preorders for the Sony Xperia Pro-I will begin October 28, 2021 at 10:00AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q320W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s value tops $1 trillion after Hertz ordered 100,000 of its vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Car Maker Tesla Reports Record Quarterly Earnings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cy6FSu1ENwRKL0_MYxbqRI0CzxM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70041271/1347936771.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcJ6yp"&gt;Rental car company Hertz has ordered 100,000 Teslas as part of an ambitious plan to electrify its fleet. A first tranche of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans will be available to rent from Hertz in major US and European markets from early November, said the company in a &lt;a href="https://ir.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement comes just months after Hertz &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/hertz-bankrupcty.html"&gt;escaped bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77ESnD"&gt;After the purchase was announced, Tesla’s stock price reached as high as $998.74 early in the day, increasing its market cap to over $1 trillion before the price dropped again. However, by the time the market closed for the day, its price had risen again, finishing at $1,024.86 per share for a market cap of $1.01 trillion. As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/tesla-shares-up-on-news-hertz-will-purchase-100000-electric-vehicles.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; notes, that put it in the rare company of other trillion-dollar market cap companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. At &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpQ0hC"&gt;News of the purchase was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-orders-100-000-teslas-tsla-stock-soars?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which says the deal is the single largest order ever for electric vehicles, and worth $4.2 billion in revenue to Tesla. The automaker’s stock was &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-surges-toward-a-record-after-hertz-reportedly-ordered-100000-tesla-evs-2021-10-25"&gt;up 4.3 percent on the news&lt;/a&gt; in pre-market trading. It was also reported this morning that Tesla’s Model 3 became the first electric vehicle to top &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744481/tesla-model-3-tops-sales-charts-europe-electric-vehicles"&gt;monthly sales charts&lt;/a&gt; in Europe this September. Earlier this month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter"&gt;reported record sales&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter, despite chip shortages denting the automotive market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="prErM2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s been a very good month for Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fGrhC"&gt;Anyone renting a Tesla from Hertz will be able to use the automaker’s network of 3,000 superchargers across the US and Europe. Hertz says it’s planing on supplementing these chargers with “thousands” of its own, dispersed “throughout its location network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YbtfM"&gt;Hertz went into bankruptcy in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy-coronavirus-car-rental.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;May last year&lt;/a&gt; after the car rental market was hit hard by the pandemic. The company, which is more than a hundred years old, was eventually re-financed to the tune of $5.9 billion by investors led by Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;Hertz now plans to electrify nearly all of its roughly 500,000 cars and vans, with the Tesla order comprising a significant first chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erfKHV"&gt;In a press statement, Hertz’s interim CEO Mark Fields said: “Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we’ve only just begun to see rising global demand and interest. The new Hertz is going to lead the way as a mobility company, starting with the largest EV rental fleet in North America and a commitment to grow our EV fleet and provide the best rental and recharging experience for leisure and business customers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpi4nh"&gt;To publicize the move, Hertz has launched a new ad campaign featuring Tom Brady. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9IcNMg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Facebook hires Britney Spears’ lawyer to fight an upcoming TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMNV0UAVwiRE5rj0ncfaYp18iGk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044546/VRG_ILLO_4033_007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel | Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uGxTnz"&gt;Facebook probably wishes it had a delete button for its timeline now that it’s threatening an upcoming TV show with a lawsuit for potentially tarnishing the brand’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHIdMX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doomsday Machine&lt;/em&gt; is the upcoming television adaption of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22577939/facebook-an-ugly-truth-frankel-kang-stamos-russia-interference"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book that exposes Facebook’s missteps on issues like misinformation, hate speech, user security. The drama will star Claire Foy as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and will tackle the chaos surrounding misinformation during the 2016 election, as well as more recent controversies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671565/facebook-xcheck-moderation-system-high-profile-exemptions"&gt;like the XCheck program&lt;/a&gt;, which let celebrities and other high-profile figures bypass content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAIEiu"&gt;As the series begins to come together, Facebook is threatening producers Anonymous Content with a lawsuit — and it’s using Britney Spears’ lawyers to do so (via &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-legal-letter-tv-adaptation-claire-foy-anonymous-content-1234861789/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/mathew-rosengart-rosengod/"&gt;Mathew Rosengart, the same lawyer who helped free Spears&lt;/a&gt; from her conservatorship, sent a letter to Anonymous Content CEO Dawn Olmstead, detailing the legal action Facebook might take if any false statements or exaggerations about the company appear in the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNdZZB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook will take all appropriate legal action”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H4mBgE"&gt;As stated in the letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, Rosengart says that “the First Amendment does not protect knowingly false statements or portrayals — or those made with reckless disregard for the truth — even about public figures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nckOTF"&gt;He then goes on to attack the accuracy of &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;, noting that it’s “replete with false and defamatory statements, characterizations, and implications about Facebook and its leadership.” If Anonymous Content decides to put any of these so-called falsities in its television adaption, Rosengart says that “Facebook will take all appropriate legal action.” To our knowledge, Facebook hasn’t taken legal action against the authors or publisher of &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odbNFa"&gt;Rosengart even mentioned that Facebook is willing to work with Anonymous Content to ensure that the series is “accurate and truthful.” As for whether Anonymous Content will consider getting Facebook’s input, that’s still up in the air. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Anonymous Content for a statement and hasn’t heard back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfebyp"&gt;Facebook is probably just blowing smoke, but there’s no way to tell until the series debuts and Facebook finds something it doesn’t like. This may be one of the only times that Facebook is actively trying to squeeze into the plaintiff’s chair, considering Facebook’s long track record of being on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736476/mark-zuckerberg-dc-attorney-general-facebook-cambridge-analytica-lawsuit"&gt;opposite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114358/facebook-550-million-settle-lawsuit-facial-recognition-technology-illinois"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144291/facebook-irs-lawsuit-9-billion-taxes"&gt;of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why smart alarm clocks can’t be trusted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57HNvUXsSUQ9v36-0_oTiB9mSA0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044517/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart alarm clocks like this Echo Dot with Clock have lots of great features, but are missing one key feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ba4CM5"&gt;When you buy a product labeled “smart,” it should be better than the “dumb” version, especially considering it costs twice as much (at least). But that’s not the case with smart alarm clocks, which are very dumb in one specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBNCYI"&gt;Smart alarm clocks are bedside buzzers with smart features, letting you set an alarm with just your voice, waking you up with your favorite Spotify playlist, possibly tracking your sleep, and definitely controlling your smart home. Most have touch screens, some have radar, very few have cameras (thankfully), and others can use lighting to wake you up more naturally than a jarring buzzer. But what none of them have is a backup battery, something that’s been standard on the dumb versions for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhIMz4"&gt;If your power goes out in the middle of the night and doesn’t come back on in time, you could stay in dreamland indefinitely. Why do smart alarm clocks not have this blindingly obvious feature? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRdoHI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Dot with a Clock&lt;/a&gt; smart speaker is clearly designed for your nightstand — the app has over 20 different alarm tones to choose from. But does it come with a battery backup? Nope. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock 2&lt;/a&gt; has a nightlight, touchscreen, even a dock for wirelessly charging your phone, but no little lithium-ion battery to make sure you wake up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; with sleep tracking is smart enough to watch you while you’re sleeping using Soli radar tech. But it’s not going to wake you up if your power goes out overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_dpEJcpDaF-qagPdJyvRt_Te4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16389067/dseifert_190620_3500_5237.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Smart Clock and the Echo Show 5 are two touchscreen smart alarm clocks that offer a myriad of smart features, but can’t be guaranteed to wake you up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0CK5If"&gt;Missing an alarm is not a huge issue for a lot of people, but for some, it’s a big problem. Take my husband for an example. He’s a fire captain / paramedic, so rolling up late to work not only raises the possibility of being fired, but it means his counterpart who was up all night dealing with a five-car pileup has to work an extra hour or two on top of his 24-hour shift. This is one of the many reasons he refuses to rely on one. He loves the features smart alarm clocks offer (especially the sleep tracking on the Google Nest Hub), but he always has his smartphone plugged in by his bed to actually wake him up. Because it, unlike any smart alarm clock, has a battery that can last well into the morning if that plug fails him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWSSdU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What none of them have is a backup battery, something that’s been standard on the dumb versions for decades &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rHRgWV"&gt;There are a couple alarm clocks out there with smart features that manage to find room for a coin cell battery or a couple AAs to keep your settings intact if the power goes out, but it’s doubtful they’ll have the juice to sound your alarm as well. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iHome-Bluetooth-Assistant-Charging-Chargers/dp/B07ZWCV1L1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This iHome alarm clock&lt;/a&gt; does and even works with Siri and Google Assistant (if you push a button). The&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyloftie.com%2F%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAjwzaSLBhBJEiwAJSRokogsRx4QFQlI9j4mz-wl9_3BfgZmr2L-8ziCfdhoiXqCLmAaJP6K9RoChiwQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22727055%2Falexa-google-smart-speaker-alarm-clocks-backup-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; $150 Loftie&lt;/a&gt;, which offers sound baths and guided meditation, also throws in a backup option. But when it comes to what I consider a real smart alarm clock, with useful features like a touchscreen, built-in voice assistants, smart home controls, and Wi-Fi connectivity, you’re out of luck if you want to be 100 percent sure you’re going to wake up on time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJdNJzPSzjVxgF_YU2Aluv4GtM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399112/dseifert_20210323_4485_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sleep tracking on the Google Nest hub is powered by radar technology -- but if the power goes out it’s not going to wake you up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zWjqgZ"&gt;It seems manufacturers are so concerned with stuffing every feature possible into their smart bedside displays that they’ve neglected to focus on the product’s original core function. That’s a running theme with many smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb6PW6"&gt;Smart alarm clocks can send you to sleep with soothing sounds of the rainforest while dimming the lights in your room, locking your doors, and adjusting your thermostat. Then they can wake you up with your favorite songs while telling your lights to gradually brighten to trick your circadian rhythm into getting its ass in gear. They can even turn on your thermostat to keep you from catching a chill when you get out of the shower. Some can also charge your phone and watch at the same time! But will any of them go off if the power is out? Nope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LDw1lJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why can’t smart alarm clocks be smart enough to do their primary job reliably?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJsL6"&gt;It doesn’t seem like that oversight is a technical limitation: Philips’ artificial sunlight alarm clock includes an 8-hour backup in case of power failures, though it’s a stretch to call it “smart.” And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review"&gt;Facebook’s new Portal Go&lt;/a&gt; is a smart display with a giant lithium-ion battery inside. While it’s not designed to be used as a bedside clock (it’s huge, has a camera in it, and is really for calling your family on Facebook — not something you often do from bed), it does prove it’s entirely possible for a smart display to have two reliable power sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0YgRA"&gt;Yes, the likelihood of being affected by a power outage is slim — the idea that your clock will be dead at the exact moment you are supposed to wake up. And, because they’re smart enough to reset when the power comes back on, you aren’t going to wake up to the terror-inducing red LEDs blinking “12:00” at you. But the fact remains: there’s a possibility they won’t work. And that’s discomforting enough for someone like my husband. He refuses to rely on a smart alarm clock until it can do its job properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ASZw2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVIt6G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’s refocusing company on ‘serving young adults’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxocgRGRsHlRH5yQFt2qd3_WlfE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044346/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="meI0dy"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he’s redirected teams within his company to “make serving young adults their north star.” The comment, made on a call with investors this afternoon, speaks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;Facebooks’ concerns about declining usage among teens and young adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1RV0K"&gt;“So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="clYbeu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok is “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LuX6K8"&gt;He suggested the change will be more than just lip service. Facebook usage among older users will grow slower than it otherwise would have because of the changes, Zuckerberg said. Even with those tradeoffs, he said, “I think it’s the right approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FszsiV"&gt;Zuckerberg expects the changes to take years. One of the more immediate shifts could be to Instagram, which he says will see “significant changes” to lean further into video and make Reels “a more central part of the experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruWVB6"&gt;The shift toward video is very clearly a response to TikTok, which Zuckerberg called “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f7RKR"&gt;While the details are largely talk for now, it’s clear that Facebook has been thinking and planning this before now. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported today on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;leaked Facebook documents showing the company’s alarm&lt;/a&gt; at seeing declining usage, with a precipitous drop predicted in the years ahead. The documents also show ideas Facebook considered to increase usage among younger users, including revamped groups, job finding tools, and “mood feeds.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this look into how Amazon’s HR falls way behind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="amazon stock 640" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kn2yA9nIYV6qotxSDOeXukTnXEs=/3x0:638x423/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044265/amazon-event-2012-_1145.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHX1lQ"&gt;An email sent to Jeff Bezos from an Amazon warehouse worker began an internal investigation that found that the e-commerce giant falls behind when it comes to supporting its 1.3 million employees, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/24/technology/amazon-employee-leave-errors.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Time&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQWlzO"&gt;From unjustified terminations to losing benefits with no warning, the employees inside the warehouse and the ones administering the leaves found themselves on the brink of burnout and sacrificing their lives to make up for countless HR issues related to paid and unpaid leave. Employees struggled to reach case managers, and doctor’s notes seem to simply disappear as paychecks were docked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni7XcM"&gt;To add to the dysfunction, Amazon’s team didn’t have any policies to accommodate local laws like one in its home state. An employee filing for unpaid leave under a Washington state legal protection of domestic violence victims was terminated from the company for missing deadlines. The Washington state attorney general that took on her case called her termination a “failure” and retaliation that violated state law, according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMNxl9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/24/technology/amazon-employee-leave-errors.html"&gt;You can go read the&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; right now. It will remind you that Amazon’s attention on consumer experience and technology doesn’t extend to the employees who keep the machine running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTaj1D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdwazz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMlk9h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USzmu1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nfq1J8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap on Anker MagGo accessories for MagSafe wireless charging in your car and home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmaNmAiCZjyJE0xIQ7sURNVG_v4=/288x0:1712x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044128/MagGo_Family.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker is introducing MagGo, its lineup of six MagSafe-compatible products for iPhones.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOdnom"&gt;Bored by the few Apple-certified MagSafe accessories like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674261/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-magsafe-find-my-tracking"&gt;MagSafe wallet (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, or the MagSafe Duo Charger, and feel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"&gt;stifled by its small ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;? If you want to expand your MagSafe-compatible collection, you’ll need to look to third-party accessory makers like Anker for some fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A07Zx0"&gt;Anker, known for its affordable charging products like portable batteries and universal plugs, is introducing its own suite of MagSafe-compatible gadgets called MagGo that go beyond just wirelessly charging your iPhone 12 or 13. Its opening lineup has six new gadgets that take advantage of the convenience and security of attaching to the phone by magnets — these products are ideal for when you’re on the move and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMmS55"&gt;Because Apple is so reluctant to certify third-party accessories and share its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;secret sauce on how to enable 15W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, none of these Anker MagGo products will be capable of fast charging the way Apple’s official MagSafe Battery Pack can. Most are available in iPhone 13 colors (Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, and Lilac Purple) and are on sale on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/355BCB41-69A1-4EC7-BF77-DCB62DD95BAE?ingress=2&amp;amp;visitId=42d1b9d2-6b48-4c12-8c52-ab68282c3cf7&amp;amp;ref_=ast_bln"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fpages%2Fmaggo-boa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt; today (except for the Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger 633). Just beware of the very similar product names — go by the product numbers instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZyJ6TqB-G3eDxFGnk36nZrVo_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954932/A25A00V1_RC01_V1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker MagGo Magnetic Phone Grip is a MagSafe version of the Pop Socket, but designed for iPhone 12s and 13s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IlKb8t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Phone Grip (610)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGd1kR"&gt;Like the popular pop sockets that you can attach to the back of your smartphone to get a better grip on the device, the Anker Magnetic Phone Grip (610) attaches to your iPhone using the MagSafe magnet. Anker claims it is “strong enough to hold up to 28oz (800g) or the equivalent weight of four iPhone 12s,” so you should not fear that you’ll drop your phone by holding onto the Phone Grip’s ring. This Phone Grip is available for $15.99 starting today on Anker.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQjCRc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger for your car (613)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNHSCx"&gt;Whether you need your phone for directions or your rideshare side hustle, you want to keep your phone in a safe and convenient place while driving in your car. Anker’s Magnetic Wireless Charger (613) is not only a minimalist car phone holder that attaches to your iPhone with the MagSafe magnet; it also wirelessly charges your phone while you drive (just 7.5W) and is adjustable up to 134 degrees to give you the best viewing angle. Just in case you need some extra USB ports in your car, the base that attaches to your dashboard also includes a dual-port USB charger: one USB-A and one 20W USB-C port. This handy car accessory retails for $69.99 starting today on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fb2930&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnVc8ag132XFdxtcWJrpAXOUEJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954957/violet_4_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker MagGo Magnetic Battery has a foldable kickstand for convenient video watching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndqarr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Battery (622) with built-in stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGWSkU"&gt;Of course, Anker has to make a MagSafe-friendly Magnetic Battery Pack (622) but with a twist. This one has a foldable kickstand that you can open to prop up your iPhone 12 or 13 while you watch a movie vertically or horizontally. Like Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack, this Anker battery attaches to the back of your iPhone but offers a much bigger 5,000mAh battery charging at a maximum of 7.5W, compared to a 1,460mAh battery charging at 15W on the Apple one. There is no getting around the fact that attaching such a big battery on the back of the phone adds 0.5 inches to its overall thickness, but you do get two extra USB-C ports in case you need to charge other devices when traveling. This 622 Magnetic Battery comes in complimentary iPhone colors (Misty Blue, Interstellar Gray, Dolomite White, Lilac Purple, Buds Green) and retails for $69.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1611&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVVTis9qkMB67ZAW3ABBxf_8_IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954810/All_Colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s MagGo Magnetic Wireless Charger (623) is a colorful and adjustable MagSafe-friendly stand and charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6mxxuT"&gt;Anker is also rolling out some handy home products that take advantage of MagSafe-friendly products for your home, like a charger and stand, as well as a power hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbP2eS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger (623)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ev6Dm3"&gt;Now that you are doing more video calls, you’d probably appreciate not having to hold your phone for a 4-hour Zoom meeting. This little (2.49 × 2.49 × 3.14 inches) Anker Magnetic Wireless Charger (623) may look like a little desk garbage can or speaker, but it’s actually a phone charging station for your desk. It can both hold and wirelessly charge your iPhone using the MagSafe magnet and can swivel up to 60 degrees to give you the best viewing angle. According to the press release, apparently, there is a second 5W wireless charging platform underneath the main round charging platform, where you can wirelessly charge your AirPods. It comes in all the iPhone 13-matching colors and is available now for $79.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Charging/dp/B09B3FR23F?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mp98Ne"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnet Wireless Charger (633)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok47zz"&gt;Not to be confused with the tiny speaker-like wireless charger (623), this Magnet Wireless Charger (633) is a two-fer that combines a magnetic battery and charging stand, all in one package. Like the Anker Magnetic Battery (622), this bundle comes with a 5,000mAh portable battery capable of charging at 7.5W, along with 2 USB-C ports that you can plug in two other devices that also need more juice. Once at your desk, you can then dock your iPhone without detaching the battery pack, so you can take a video call while wirelessly charging your phone. Its base even has an additional USB-C port and is a secondary 5W charging surface for your AirPods. Unlike the other MagGo products, this particular one won’t be available until December and will retail for $119.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25a7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker MagGo Magnet Charging Station looks like a desktop speaker but it’s really a charging hub for all your gadgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C9gQEg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anker Magnet Charging Station (637)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65uu3W"&gt;Round and colorful, you’d never guess that this is actually an 8-in-1 power hub for your desk. Not only is the round surface in front a MagSafe charging platform and holder for your iPhone, but the back is also packed full of plugs for all your gadget needs. You can even simultaneously charge eight devices at once if you must. There are 2 USB-C ports, 2 USB-A ports, and three AC outlets that can charge a large laptop at full speed. Available only in America starting today, October 25th, 2021, for $99.99 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F25%2F22744362%2Fanker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Charging-Wireless-Delivery/dp/B099W4CTJ5?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is spending at least $10 billion this year on its metaverse division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTfnGZr0oBj0DVirload1xgMKns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044102/acasto_180123_1777_0002_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6DVz4"&gt;Facebook plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs, its metaverse division tasked with creating AR and VR hardware, software, and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUdWiB"&gt;“We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;its third-quarter earnings release&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon. Facebook sees AR and VR as being core to “the next generation of online social experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UhIsEY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A sign that Reality Labs should be judged separately from Facebook’s core apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d59BDQ"&gt;The division, which already makes the Oculus Quest headset and Portal lineup of calling devices, is clearly being positioned as the next big thing inside of Facebook. For one, CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;has been talking about the metaverse nonstop&lt;/a&gt; for the past several months. And today, Facebook said it’s going to begin reporting earnings specifically for its Reality Labs segment, while Facebook’s main ads business — a staggering $28 billion this last quarter alone — will be reported under another bucket. It’s a sign to investors that the Reality Labs business matters and should be judged separately from how they value Facebook today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8xI4V"&gt;It’s also a move to, perhaps, distract from what else is going on in Facebook’s earnings today. The company missed revenue expectations by around $1 billion (this is not a lot, exactly, at Facebook’s scale), which speaks to some of the company’s struggles right now. Facebook blames a number of factors for this: COVID-19, the economy, and Apple’s recent ad-tracking changes — something we saw last week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738940/snap-q3-2021-earnings-ios-ad-tracking"&gt;when Snap reported earnings&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8xg0j"&gt;Apple updated iOS in April with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;a new privacy feature&lt;/a&gt; that requires users to actively opt in to allow apps to track them across other apps and websites. Initially, social media companies said they weren’t certain how much it would impact their ads businesses, which rely on that tracking in part to measure the efficacy of ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbJUKI"&gt;It’s been a rough few weeks for Facebook. A series of stories in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;detailed significant missteps by the company, including moderation issues and concerns about younger users’ mental health; the whistleblower who leaked those documents then testified before Congress; and just this morning, dozens of stories were published by a consortium of news outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, covering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;even more problems for Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;including worries about declining usage among teens&lt;/a&gt;. Also, in the middle of all of that, Facebook’s apps were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;all down for a good chunk of a day&lt;/a&gt; in early October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgQujb"&gt;On a call with investors Monday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg struck a defiant tone about the leaked documents, saying they were part of a “coordinated effort” to “paint a false picture of our company.” He then quickly pivoted to talking about Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;work to court young people&lt;/a&gt; and building the metaverse, reinforcing the idea that the the company &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/bc59d6b3-0ae0-4451-8e38-ed6b22211044"&gt;would like to push toward something new&lt;/a&gt; where, just maybe, it can escape some of the scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyExxr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 25th, 6:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with remarks from Facebook’s earnings call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy and Home Depot drop security cameras linked to Uyghur surveillance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_tAKxkuUFTox2W7PGKTWJG2ILk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70044088/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GVAY3H"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowes will no longer be selling security cameras from Lorex and Ezviz after &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/lorex-ezviz-pulled-from-shelves/"&gt;the outlet reported&lt;/a&gt; on the brands’ parent companies’ involvement in supplying the Chinese government with surveillance tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snYg4H"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list"&gt;According to the US government&lt;/a&gt;, both Dahua (Lorex’s owner) and Hikvision (Ezviz’s owner) stand implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. They have reportedly helped supply surveillance equipment for monitoring ethnic minorities. One of the largest oppressed groups is the Uyghurs, a largely Muslim ethnic group &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/2021-report-to-congress-pursuant-to-section-5-of-the-elie-wiesel-genocide-and-atrocities-prevention-act-of-2018"&gt;the Chinese government is accused of&lt;/a&gt; putting in detention or reeducation camps, using as forced labor, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvFGOP"&gt;The home security cameras and systems from Lorex and Ezviz aren’t banned from sale in the US, despite &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list"&gt;restrictions from the Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; on their parent companies. However, when &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reached out to retailers about Lorex and Ezviz’s links, Home Depot and Best Buy reportedly promised to stop working with the companies. Home Depot cited its “standards of ethical sourcing” as its reason for pulling the products from its online store, and while Lowes reportedly didn’t respond about the matter, Lorex’s products were pulled from its site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZtNBrE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lorex security cameras are still available for purchase on Best Buy’s site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aduuW4"&gt;Best Buy told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; that it would be “discontinuing its relationship” with the companies. However, Lorex’s security cameras &lt;a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=lorex"&gt;still seem to be available on its site&lt;/a&gt; (and certain models are even on sale). Searching Ezviz turns up no results. Home Depot and Lowes’ search systems don’t return anything for Lorex either; while the latter shows results for Ezviz, all the products are listed as unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3r_jnoC98GikzoBLy7-3qwsDZUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954471/Screen_Shot_2021_10_25_at_10.48.48_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy’s site still shows many Lorex products. (Screenshot taken on October 25th, at 1:40PM ET.) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5nC9f9"&gt;These surveillance issues aren’t only limited to security camera companies. The US government has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;limited how US companies can work with drone maker DJI&lt;/a&gt; by adding it to the Entity List after reports raised concerns about its drones also being provided to police forces in Xinjiang. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22193660/us-government-dji-drone-entity-list-export-ban-effects"&gt;DJI’s consumer products are still allowed&lt;/a&gt;, but companies would face similar ethical dilemmas when it comes to selling DJI’s products as they would for Lorex (though DJI is a bigger name in drones than Lorex is in home security). Best Buy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it intends to &lt;a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/brands/dji/pcmcat748300478578.c?id=pcmcat748300478578"&gt;keep selling DJI’s drones and cameras&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iah48n"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/lorex-box?code=xybl"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;IPVM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a surveillance-focused outlet that co-reported the story with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, the president of the World Uyghur Congress said that it’s “unacceptable that there are still American companies directly helping further” the group’s oppression. The statement could apply to retailers like Costco and Sam’s Club, which continue to sell Lorex products, but it could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;also apply to tech giants&lt;/a&gt; like Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and more, which have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;been tied to suppliers that reportedly used forced Uyghur labor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5avCi6"&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/2021-report-to-congress-pursuant-to-section-5-of-the-elie-wiesel-genocide-and-atrocities-prevention-act-of-2018"&gt;the US government saying&lt;/a&gt; that China was committing genocide against Uyghurs, &lt;a href="https://uphill.thedispatch.com/p/us-admitted-zero-uyghur-refugees"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says that the country didn’t admit a single refugee from the minority group between October 2020 and September 2021. The report cites difficulties escaping China due to checkpoints and video surveillance, a maze of red tape, and “lack of urgency” when granting asylum as reasons for the shortage of admissions. &lt;/p&gt;
