    <title>Epic finally admits that its Imposters mode was ‘inspired’ by Among Us </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hEQsAZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Imposter mode&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; clone in all but name, but nearly two months later, Epic Games is finally acknowledging in &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v18-20-update-combat-assault-rifle-vs-combat-smg"&gt;today’s patch notes&lt;/a&gt; what was clear from the start: Imposters was “inspired by &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; from Innersloth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlXtIz"&gt;Imposters launched in August, set in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s canon and 3D worlds but borrowing heavily from &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ gameplay, mechanics, and even terminology (like the “Imposters” name itself). At the time, Epic didn’t credit &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; or Innersloth, leading members of Innersloth’s team to complain about having their work copied without credit or the chance to collaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xthuap"&gt;As Innersloth co-founder Marcus Bromander noted at the time, the company didn’t patent the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; mechanics, but he lamented Epic’s lack of effort in developing its own more unique take on the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xyzuum"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We didn't patent the Among Us mechanics. I don't think that leads to a healthy game industry. Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?&lt;/p&gt;— Puff (@PuffballsUnited) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PuffballsUnited/status/1427781760692068355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>NASA’s massive next-generation space telescope arrives in South America ahead of launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RK110eq--2ZrvQdYw66BH6cCdQU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985214/51540583960_6b4cb9d516_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JWST undergoing testing at Northrop Grumman earlier this year&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Northrop Grumman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rt9Qwg"&gt;After more than two decades of delays and ballooning development costs, NASA’s next-generation space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-webb-space-telescope-arrives-in-french-guiana-after-sea-voyage"&gt;has arrived in French Guiana, South America&lt;/a&gt; — the site of the spacecraft’s planned launch later this year. Its arrival sparks the beginning of weeks of final preparations before the telescope is loaded on the top of its rocket for flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5ZYBF"&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, spent 16 days at sea, packed inside an environmentally controlled, custom-built shipping container aboard a French cargo ship. The vessel transported the spacecraft from Redondo Beach, California, the site of the telescope’s primary contractor, Northrup Grumman. JWST had been at Northrop since early 2018, where it was undergoing final assembly and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z12iHq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the spacecraft is closer than ever to its launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2iuhN"&gt;Now that JWST is in French Guiana, the spacecraft is closer than ever to its launch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17627560/james-webb-space-telescope-cost-estimate-nasa-northrop-grumman"&gt;which has long been a moving target&lt;/a&gt;. Originally proposed in 1996, JWST was supposed to launch as early as 2007 for a cost of $1 billion. But the project’s timeline has been delayed numerous times, as the budget of the mission has increased to $9.7 billion. On September 8th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;NASA set a target launch date for December 18th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, 14 years later than originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n61UV1Gx89Z0tguvoXXfwoiDCxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22921186/calibriarrivalinfggunn_secondary.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA/Chris Gunn&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JWST arriving in French Guiana aboard the MN Colibri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qwLH9V"&gt;Many of the delays resulted from problems that arose during testing of the spacecraft. JWST has undergone a battery of tests, including vibrational and cryogenic testing, to ensure that spacecraft can withstand the intensity of launch and the harsh space environment. However, during testing and assembly at Northrop Grumman, some screws came loose, valves leaked, and engineers found tears in the spacecraft’s thin sunshield, which is crucial for protecting JWST from overheating while in direct view of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oCeFR"&gt;Testing eventually wrapped up on JWST in August of this year, and Northrop Grumman spent the next month carefully folding the telescope into the right configuration it needed to be in for transport to French Guiana. NASA also purposefully did not reveal the exact date JWST left Redondo Beach at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/03/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-pirates/618268/"&gt;over fears that the vessel carrying the spacecraft might be intercepted by pirates&lt;/a&gt;. Late in the night on September 24th, a police escort accompanied&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;JWST in its shipping container on a 26-mile journey through Los Angeles to Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, where it was loaded onto its ride to Kourou, French Guiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ30F6"&gt;There’s still plenty left to do before flight, but when JWST &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; launch, it’s set to revolutionize astronomy, allowing researchers to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before. Set to fly to space on top of a European Ariane 5 rocket, the telescope is supposed to journey to a spot one million miles from Earth. With a massive gold-plated mirror spanning 25 feet wide, JWST will be able to gather light from the oldest objects in the Universe — some that formed just after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wXupP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best gaming laptop in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best gaming laptop is the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is a great gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is a great gaming laptop you can buy for $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. You can buy it for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="n9BvYP"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="OCz9wT"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OanWnj"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful 14-inch device that can keep up with the best 15-inch gaming laptops on the market, the only place you’ll find that is the Razer Blade 14. This slim and portable device includes Nvdia’s RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, Nvidia’s top-of-the-line mobile GPUs, as well as a powerful eight-core AMD chip. It’s a gorgeous device, with a QHD 165Hz display option and a classy RGB keyboard. There’s even a reasonable port selection, including HDMI 2.1 as well as two USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a portable, powerful gaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;A gaming laptop with an exceptional keyboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is no longer the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s still great. For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent, and the keyboard is one of the absolute best you can buy on the market. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, though the Razer Blade 14 delivers better raw performance, we still have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eM7Jm"&gt;Asus recently collaborated with DJ Alan Walker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with a box that becomes  DJ deck. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Daily’s founding producer, Theo Balcomb, is leaving the Times</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7C55vi0bdGERN2ggihKYqBDlIjA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985142/VRG_TheoBalcomb_Expanded_Photo_s.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G1lEfK"&gt;Hello again, and thanks for reading &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;. Today’s an unexpectedly busy one — with a scoop for us to get into. I’ll waste no time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIg9kf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOOP: Theo Balcomb is leaving &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96DmyK"&gt;Theo Balcomb, the producer and co-creator of &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;who’s widely acknowledged for propelling the show to success, is leaving &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; nearly five years &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/a-big-hire-and-familiar-voice-for-new-audio-project/"&gt;after joining&lt;/a&gt;. Balcomb will launch her own independent business focused on producing and editing, she confirmed with &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;. Her last day will be October 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Jxcnd"&gt;A quick summary of Balcomb’s very busy audio life: She started at NPR as an intern and rose the ranks to become the youngest supervising producer on &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt;. She &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/a-big-hire-and-familiar-voice-for-new-audio-project/"&gt;joined the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 as senior producer for a soon-to-be-launched, unnamed show, aka&lt;em&gt; The Daily&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt; went on to be a smashing success that reaches &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/michael-barbaro-the-daily-podcast-new-york-times.html"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; of people per day. In 2019, she &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/theo-balcomb-to-lead-news-for-audio/"&gt;was promoted&lt;/a&gt; to executive producer of &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt; and News, where she is today. All of which is to say: Congrats to Theo, and we’re excited to hear what she gets up to next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sBKA5"&gt;Which leads to our next breaking news item...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcBZs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The newest podcast app on the block: New York Times Audio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQNedE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/the-new-york-times-launches-a-test-app-for-its-growing-audio-ambitions?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reports this morning&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is testing an audio-only app called New York Times Audio. The app will distribute the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ own podcasts, as well as licensed &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; episodes and audio versions of news and magazine articles created through Audm, which the company acquired in 2020. These Audm stories will come not only from the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; but also from other publishers, including &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. (The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ audio content will still be broadly available — this isn’t an exclusives move yet.) &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says the app is still being viewed as an “experiment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmm0th"&gt;Although the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ audio products are widely upheld as not only stellar pieces of work but also major hits, I’m not convinced this app will take off. We’ve seen the struggle new audio apps, like Luminary, have had when launching, even when they sign big names and recruit massive shows. It’s still not even clear whether Spotify has usurped Apple as the go-to podcasting app in the US, despite its mega-deals. Podcasting’s a crowded field, so I can only envision this &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; effort succeeding if the team makes the exclusives play or offers some sort of bonus material through the app. We’ll see, though, and if you get a chance to sign up for this beta, please do pass along screenshots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzPgf6"&gt;And finally: big &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; audio week, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRAWML"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caliphate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; subject admits to fabricating story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khd1IZ"&gt;The primary subject of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Shehroze Chaudhry, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/09/world/middleeast/shehroze-chaudhry-caliphate.html"&gt;has admitted&lt;/a&gt; to making up his story about life as a terrorist and executioner in Syria. Criminal charges against him have since been dropped. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote this news up, pointing out that a statement of facts in court claims Rukmini Callimachi, who hosted the show, pushed Chaudhry to share details on these killings. Callimachi denies this, however. You all know the story of &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; by now, but to sum it up: the show was widely praised, won a Peabody, and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, but last year, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; announced that it would review the show after it “fell short of standards.” In this latest write-up, a &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson says, “Since that time, we’ve introduced new practices to prevent similar lapses,” but it’s unclear what those fixes are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8zulx"&gt;Alright, that’s enough &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;news for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XDeOqg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6PTkBc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interaction’s the word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teWMxt"&gt;I published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722468/spotify-amazon-facebook-audio-podcast-polls-interact"&gt;a report today&lt;/a&gt; about the interactive audio trend I’m seeing bubble up. Notably, Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701219/spotify-interactive-podcast-polls-question-answer-feature-launch-anchor"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a Q&amp;amp;A and polls feature for its Anchor podcasters, along with testing interactive ads, and Amazon has been spotted polling podcasters about their interest in polls, as well. There’s a lot more in the piece, which I encourage you all to read, but the big question for us is whether people want to tap a phone screen while listening to a podcast. Personally, I listen to my shows as an escape from the screen, so having to take it out of my bag to give a podcaster feedback doesn’t immediately appeal to me. Although, when I think about my favorite shows asking for my opinion, I can sort of see myself wanting to share. More than that, though, these features are just another way to lock both listeners and podcasters into a specific platform. Competition, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaR0xX"&gt;Facebook is one of the platforms attempting interaction in the form of comments, and it happens to have news for us this week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7aL156"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook gives an audio update, starts to expand podcast functionality globally; plus, a hint at its monetization goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7HXwz"&gt;Yesterday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720635/facebook-expands-live-audio-feature-more-creators-globally-instagram-reels-soundbites"&gt;gave us&lt;/a&gt; a clearer timeline and updates on all its various audio features. Plus, we got firm confirmation the company plans to get into podcast monetization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAdGR3"&gt;But first! The updates. Live Audio Rooms, Facebook’s Clubhouse competitor, are rolling out globally, including to Groups. Soundbites, its shareable audio clips feature, is also now coming to more people in the US over the coming weeks. And finally, in its section about podcasts, Facebook says it’s still siloing podcast functionality to the US, but critically, it notes: “We have a lot more to do here, and are excited to work alongside podcast creators to carry out our long-term vision in offering a holistic experience that brings together new distribution opportunities, discovery, monetization and social connection for podcasts in one place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94qU8e"&gt;The word that sticks out to me here is monetization. I suspected Facebook would be interested in not only distributing RSS-based podcasts on its platform but also potentially hosting and monetizing them. Facebook obviously doesn’t say that’s the plan explicitly in the above quote, but I have to imagine adding audio ads to its targeted ad marketplace is on the roadmap somewhere — it just makes sense! Also interesting here is Spotify has been attempting to recruit small businesses to its audio ad inventory (see its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697557/clubhouse-creators-hot-pod-newsletter-free-edition"&gt;latest ad campaign&lt;/a&gt;), and Facebook has the clear leg up. Its ad business is fully built out across various apps and mediums, it has lots more data than Spotify (however you feel about that), a massive user base, and it could easily slot audio into its self-serve platform. How fast can Spotify move?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KW0aiK"&gt;Although Facebook says it plans to roll out podcast functionality globally, it didn’t provide a rollout date. However, it might already be happening abroad, specifically in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTBmn4"&gt;Per a tweet, Argentina-based podcasters are being asked to integrate their RSS feeds with Facebook. Maybe the global Facebook podcast push will be happening soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHuV-xkYVpNbOw7jNv3_SAhvnuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920937/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_9.25.13_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SizMPZ"&gt;Meanwhile, in independent land, we have a couple updates from popular shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmHFWE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re Wrong About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; co-host leaves the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHtOL7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re Wrong About&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast that reexamines media narratives around controversial figures and events, is losing a co-host. Michael Hobbes announced in yesterday’s 20-minute episode that he’s ready for a change. Sarah Marshall will continue the show, which has been a major success on Patreon with over 30,000 subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRRqGR"&gt;We’re all hearing about the big job changes — people quitting and trying new things mid-pandemic — and I imagine this is partially about that and partially about burnout. The independent creator world, even for successful folks, is an exhausting one. Michael still hosts his &lt;em&gt;Maintenance Phase&lt;/em&gt; show about the problems with diet culture, so presumably, we’ll continue to hear his thoughts over there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkLKHH"&gt;Alright, for our final one here, let’s get a look at another update on exclusives…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMpjMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Podcast on the Left&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; abandons Spotify, signs a three-year deal with Stitcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M0Pga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Podcast on the Left&lt;/em&gt;, a successful independent show with over 15,000 Patreon subscribers, is goinag wide. The show went exclusive to Spotify in 2019, and today, SiriusXM and Stitcher announced the show will once again be RSS-based and available on all podcasting apps. This starts next year. Sirius/Stitcher will exclusively sell ads for the show, while Stitcher Premium subscribers can receive it ad-free. This marks the second major Spotify-exclusive show, after Joe Budden’s, to not re-up their contract with Spotify. I imagine we’re going to keep hearing more of this as the big-name contracts expire — a bad sign for Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDNNg2"&gt;Alright, that’s it. Wow. A marathon. Thanks, as always, for reading, and if you want more audio and podcasting news, subscribe for Hot Pod Insider. I’ll be back here Thursday with more.&lt;/p&gt;

The iconic plaza in Old Havana is just one of many landmarks that could face a watery grave in the future if greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels continue unabated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="gmXFnN"&gt;You can see the potential future for more than 100 coastal cities across 39 countries thanks to a new &lt;a href="https://picturing.climatecentral.org/"&gt;image gallery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://coastal.climatecentral.org/map/13/-73.53/41.0416/?theme=warming&amp;amp;map_type=multicentury_slr_comparison&amp;amp;basemap=roadmap&amp;amp;elevation_model=best_available&amp;amp;lockin_model=levermann_2013&amp;amp;refresh=true&amp;amp;temperature_unit=C&amp;amp;warming_comparison=%5B%221.5%22%2C%223.0%22%5D"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; published today by the nonprofit advocacy group Climate Central. The visualizations compare two scenarios: future&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sea level rise with 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming above preindustrial levels or sea level rise with 3 degrees of warming. As the planet heats up, warm ocean water expands and glaciers and ice sheets melt, causing sea levels to rise.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QqojRA"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Sea level rise is so much more than melting ice|57576" data-volume-uuid="9f5b7508d" data-volume-id="57576" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-259" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5LrJ5"&gt;Even 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming will expose more people around the world to disastrous flooding, but it’s considered a sort of best-case scenario for limiting the effects of climate change. The world, unfortunately, is still &lt;a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/global-update-paris-agreement-turning-point/"&gt;on track&lt;/a&gt; to reach close to 3 degrees of warming in just 79 years. The renderings &lt;a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/water-and-drought/article254931412.html"&gt;don’t take into consideration how levees&lt;/a&gt; might be able to hold water back; the authors of the research write that city planners will need to “defend” against the encroaching waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFO1p9"&gt;Check out some of the visualizations of what places around the world could look like in coming centuries if the world doesn’t act fast enough to combat climate change. It builds on &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2e6b"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;. Climate Central collaborated with researchers from Princeton University, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and Columbia University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jx1MEn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10803284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wHtHoX"&gt;At least 10 percent of the global population lives on land that could be inundated at high tide with 3 degrees Celsius of warming, the researchers found. The risk isn’t spread evenly: many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;low-lying, small island nations could be completely swallowed up. Many Asian countries could be particularly hard hit. China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh have the biggest populations living in places that could one day be below the high-tide line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6VjI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10803286"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RoztFf"&gt;“Sea level rise is threatening not just our heritage, but also our future,” Anders Levermann, one of the authors of the new research and a professor at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The pollution choices that nations make in the years to come will determine how much of the cities in which we live today can be preserved, and where their next generations can safely live.” World leaders will gather for a United Nations climate summit in Glasgow next month to ramp up their commitments on climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Dn6OBr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10803296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bBApf4"&gt;While it could take centuries for sea levels to completely drown many places, the climate crisis is already causing big problems now. About a quarter of all critical infrastructure in the US faces flood risk that could render them inoperable, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-10-11/flooding-threatens-25-of-us-infrastructure-study-says"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by nonprofit research group First Street Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlYgpM"&gt;Another major study on the effects of climate change around the world was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01168-6.epdf?sharing_token=2j-xaWLsz1JyBmFeDsO-GNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PwAcRfhcoupIk0A95eY8_-lUvstnryI-SR9UaIsiFOg-w-sDdhuWJHxx39U7Z_9mOCeWTIgnk-7Lk-NTsLYd2qZ5_zt5YhTDE6WOUkRO83z-tYhnnXusDZChTwM43UoaaP2vnzuE0TkzIjU_36EGQi9cFYngJeWr7963TOv63tbuvwk_dzsLAG4Kw3ZeyVebQ%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=www.washingtonpost.com"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Climate Change &lt;/em&gt;yesterday. It found that 85 percent of the world’s population has already experienced weather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;made worse by human-caused climate change&lt;/a&gt;. But because of a dearth of climate research in developing nations, there are likely even more detrimental effects from climate change that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/10/11/85-percent-population-climate-impacts/"&gt;weren’t captured in the study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to transfer your Google Authenticator 2FA to a new phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google apps 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QjVD9k3z6qn6JMeGSQem9PSIWf8=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67344098/1008258386.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by S3studio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fpM5Ry"&gt;Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the best and easiest ways to keep your online accounts secure. It works by issuing an authentication code on your phone when somebody tries to access the account; if that person doesn’t have the code, they (or you) don’t get in. By using a 2FA app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, you can prevent somebody from accessing your data by getting your password. (You can have a code texted to you, but that is considered far less secure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564381/community-hacking-sim-hijacking-cryptocurrency"&gt;due to the rise of so-called SIM hacking&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czgQrl"&gt;There is, of course, a catch. Because 2FA uses a key specific to your phone, if you lose or break your phone, you can’t simply reinstall the app on your new phone and go on from there. You need to transfer the key code for that phone as well as the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="URpdzV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to set up two-factor authentication on all your online accounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/17/15772142/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7PpqsB"&gt;Different authentication apps handle this in different ways. In this article, I’m going to look at Google Authenticator, including the easiest way to transfer the app to a new phone if you do have access to the old one, and how you can prepare for a possible problem (like a broken phone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is3Vpn"&gt;Google Authenticator lets you establish 2FA by using your phone to scan a QR code generated by the app on a separate device or by entering a key code. It’s a relatively easy process — unless you find you have to move the app to a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02bKEg"&gt;Because 2FA uses security keys that are specific to each piece of hardware, you can’t simply reinstall Google Authenticator on your new phone and use it to log in. Instead, you have to transfer the keys to your new app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsZK4D"&gt;The easiest method, especially if you use 2FA with several apps, is to use the Authenticator app’s dedicated transfer feature to move your keys from one phone to the other. However, there are two assumptions here: first, that you have access to both the old and new phone, and second, that you have Android devices. If either of these assumptions doesn’t work for your situation, there are other methods you can use, which we’ll cover next. But first, the easy method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XquXdx"&gt;Transfer your Authenticator keys via Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VDaOp7"&gt;If you’ve got two Android phones, you can transfer your accounts to a new phone by exporting them via a QR code generated by the Authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="87Arix"&gt;Install Google Authenticator on your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tzp7zN"&gt;Tap “Get started.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u8otzk"&gt;Tap “Scan a QR code.” You’ll get a grid and instructions to “Place QR code within red lines.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cQRq8O"&gt;Open Google Authenticator on your older phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c1Iuv5"&gt;Tap on the three dots on the top right of the screen and select “Transfer accounts”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VsTg7c"&gt;Select “Export accounts.” You may be asked to verify your identity via a fingerprint, password, or another method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iLMidD"&gt;Uncheck which accounts you don’t want to export. Tap “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hvE9GK"&gt;You’ll be shown a QR code. Center it in the grid in your new phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xJTRaf"&gt;You should see the imported app now listed in your Google Authenticator app in the new phone. (Note: the app will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be deleted from your old phone.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zx8ufp"&gt;Alternative method #1: Use your backup codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TyE2Kk"&gt;When you first set up Google Authenticator, you may be given a set of backup codes and asked to print them out or otherwise save them. And you definitely do want to save them; print them out and put them somewhere safe or create a PDF and save it where nobody else can access it. If your phone goes south, these codes will be a good way to reestablish authentication on your new phone — assuming, of course, you haven’t misplaced the codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSjHAl"&gt;This is also the way to reestablish your keys on a new iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3obrx"&gt;If you missed that step during the installation, you can get those backup codes anyway. For that, you have to &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/"&gt;go into your Google account&lt;/a&gt; and then follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4qZ6C0"&gt;Click on “Security” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nu4Jy8"&gt;Scroll down to and select “2-Step Verification.” You’ll probably have to enter your password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pX2cHM"&gt;Scroll down to “Backup Codes” and click on “Show Codes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Show Codes” to get your ten backup codes for your Google account. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjOPbBjbxGfCYoaXJJsk4QjXWBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920572/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_10.40.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Show Codes” to get your ten backup codes for your Google account. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fK3y9x"&gt;You’ll get a list of 10 codes. Each code can be used once; if you use them all, you can get more by clicking on “Show Codes” and then on “Get New Codes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UDvz7q"&gt;Alternative method #2: Take a screenshot of the barcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fmnJtp"&gt;One way to create a backup in case you lose your phone is to take and save a screenshot of the barcode that is created for each 2FA-secured app. If you’ve mislaid your backup codes, but you’ve saved a screenshot of the QR barcode that you originally used to create your app’s authentication, you can use that screenshot to establish your credentials on a new phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbuGUo"&gt;Just throw the screenshot up on your computer, install Google Authenticator on your new phone, and use the plus sign on the app to scan the barcode. (You can also enter the setup key code if that’s what you saved.) Do this for each of your apps, and you’ll be all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkGcse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 12th, 2021, 11:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on September 2nd, 2020; the directions for transferring between Android phones have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces October 18th event after months of Mac rumors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple October 18th event invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POOvNv7zsPYLW-WxI4c3CpaPjmU=/92x0:1328x824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984773/image__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple October 18th event invitation | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRoatW"&gt;Apple’s next hardware event will take place on October 18th, according to invites it sent out today. The company is widely expected to use its second fall event to launch a pair of new MacBooks, a redesigned higher-end Mac Mini, and possibly a pair of third-generation AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4gYMr"&gt;The invite video teases one word: Unleashed. As seen below in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from Apple marketing exec Greg Joswiak, it appears in a dotted font that could hint at mini LED tech on the way. The “special” event will stream live on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/"&gt;Apple.com&lt;/a&gt; at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTTWne"&gt;There have been reports for months that Apple is on the cusp of releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models&lt;/a&gt;. The new MacBooks would be the latest step in Apple’s transition away from Intel chips, replacing them with an Arm-based processor called the M1X that Apple designs itself. The new chip could boost performance compared to the M1 chip that debuted last year, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-set-for-first-macbook-pro-revamp-in-five-years-on-oct-18?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; the M1X has ten CPU cores compared to the M1’s eight, plus graphics processors with 16 or 32 cores compared to seven or eight in M1-equipped machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8HShL"&gt;Other anticipated features include the return of fan-favorite MacBook features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;magnetic MagSafe charging&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;HDMI port, and an SD card slot&lt;/a&gt;. The maligned OLED touch bar, mercifully, could be on the way out. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1447700808821260292?s=20"&gt;Gurman recently noted&lt;/a&gt; that stock of the company’s existing MacBook Pro appears to be running low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A370IL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Unleashed! These next six days are going to speed by. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0ops2bVPvl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0ops2bVPvl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IisHHU"&gt;Rumors suggest that the same M1X processor will feature in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;redesigned higher-end Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The new machine will reportedly have more ports than last year’s M1 model, with two Thunderbolt / USB 4 Type-C ports and two USB Type-A ports. The changes should make the new Mac Mini much better suited to power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlrkgz"&gt;Finally, Apple may announce a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;pair of redesigned AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, representing the third generation of the company’s original true wireless earbuds. The AirPods are expected to adopt a design similar to the AirPods Pro, with shorter stems and a redesigned charging case. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe shows off upcoming Camera Raw support for Photoshop on iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YgUt8gvg7fpJjI0QtjkngwZiYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984656/vpavic_210512_4592_0192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3V1QJT"&gt;Adobe is bringing Camera Raw to the iPad version of Photoshop, and has demonstrated how it works in a hands-on video. Ryan Dumlao, senior product manager for Photoshop on iPad, shows how Camera Raw can be used to edit RAW and DNG photos directly imported from a camera — in this case a Fujifilm — or ProRAW files from the iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1bLeF"&gt;Camera Raw is a long-standing plugin that allows for advanced RAW image editing within Photoshop, and it’s also the technical basis of Lightroom’s processing engine. Dumlao’s video shows how you can edit various settings and exposure parameters within Photoshop, including importing the RAW file as a smart object for non-destructive editing that can be carried over to the desktop version. In his demo, Dumlao uses Photoshop features to perform tasks like removing individual tree branches and adjusting the color of a specific rope in his photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PXVc1"&gt;While many photographers use Lightroom as their primary editing tool, adding Camera Raw to Photoshop for iPad will dramatically expand the photo editing capabilities for iPad owners who use Photoshop as a big part of their workflow. Adobe hasn’t announced exactly when the feature will be released, only saying that it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pVeLVf"&gt;First announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;Apple’s WWDC earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, Siri has now landed on Ecobee SmartThermostats. The Apple voice assistant arrives via a free software update allowing you to say “Hey Siri” to the thermostat to set the temperature, send an intercom message, and use all of Siri’s smart speaker features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS1OHu"&gt;This is the first third-party device to include Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, although the feature is not exclusive to Ecobee. Apple said that all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523045/apple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv"&gt;HomeKit accessory makers will be able to integrate Siri&lt;/a&gt; voice control into their products starting this year. For any integration to work, you will need to have a HomePod or HomePod Mini on the same network, through which the device (in this case the SmartThermostat) will send the requests. The integration won’t work with just an Apple TV or iPad running as your HomeKit hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkTuSF"&gt;The function only works with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;newest Ecobee SmartThermostat with voice control&lt;/a&gt; ($249.99), which has a built-in microphone and speaker and has supported Amazon’s Alexa since its release in 2019. You can’t have both AIs active at the same time, however; you have to choose, but you can switch back at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyGAGPF6b55kbjqa9wlCrYXH-4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920314/17844DDA_4994_4E50_85B5_2C1DA3F6D386.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siri is now on the Ecobee SmartThermostat, but you still need a HomePod Mini on hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oXJiHk"&gt;Siri is my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704860/siri-best-smart-home-voice-assistant-editorial"&gt;main smart home driver&lt;/a&gt;, so I have been impatiently waiting for this update. It landed on my thermostat this weekend and so far the experience has been pretty good (barring a few hiccups getting it going). It’s essentially like having a HomePod on your wall. I can do everything I can with a HomePod using the Ecobee instead: set timers, ask about the weather, find my iPhone, and control lights and other smart home devices. It was fractionally slower than using Apple’s own smart speaker for those tasks, but not enough to be an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmhBNS"&gt;The Ecobee’s microphones and speakers aren’t as ideally situated as on a HomePod — they’re in the back of the device against the wall, so it did have some trouble hearing me, and if you have an Apple device nearby — phone, watch, etc. — that device invariably picks up the request first. This is a good thing, though; really you want the thermostat to be the fallback device, not the primary one. With Alexa in the Ecobee, it often picks up the request over any other nearby Echo speaker, and I get music playing on its tinny speaker instead of the Echo Studio I’d intended it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea4HhF"&gt;The Ecobee speaker also shows up as an Airplay option, which was surprisingly fun, especially as you can group it with other Airplay speakers. I experienced a major smart home nerd moment when I was streaming music from a smart smoke alarm (Onelink Safe &amp;amp; Sound) and a smart thermostat, simultaneously. Welcome to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEVmME"&gt;Music is one area the Siri integration is better than Ecobee’s Alexa integration. While Amazon’s voice assistant works out of the box with the thermostat and you can play music through the thermostat, it doesn’t work with Alexa’s multiroom feature. It’s pretty sad to try and rock out with music just from your thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tPA6jl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No one should go out and spend $350 just for this experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wuNX2o"&gt;Setting up the integration is simple: pair the Ecobee to HomeKit from the thermostat’s screen, then add it as an accessory through the Home app, and an option to “Speak to Siri” will pop up. From there, you can tailor the experience (such as deciding if you want to enable personal requests). If your thermostat is already connected to HomeKit, a card will appear in the Home app asking if you want to enable Siri. You can switch between voice assistants in the integrations menu in settings on the thermostat or in the Ecobee app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3x3dI"&gt;Having Siri in more places in the home will help make the voice assistant a more useful smart home controller. However, putting it in a $250 thermostat doesn’t exactly make the HomeKit experience a less expensive one. Plus, you have to have a HomePod Mini for it to work. No one should go out and spend $350 just for this experience. It’s useful for those who already have this tech. But going forward, I would like to see some Siri-enabled accessories under $50 to help bring the voice assistant into more corners of your smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iV1ciq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s essentially like having a HomePod on your wall — who doesn’t want that?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLTT6f"&gt;In other Ecobee news, the company has been testing out some user interface changes on its optional Beta program. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ecobee/comments/q1rpk5/i_wish_the_temp_adjustment_was_tap_able/"&gt;According to a post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, one change is replacing the fiddly slider used to adjust the thermostat’s temperature with a tappable option. I asked Ecobee about this potential new interface and it told me: “We’re currently exploring some UI changes to the Home screen of the Ecobee SmartThermostat with voice control, and have invited several thousand thermostat users to participate in this optional Beta.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8mDRa"&gt;It’s a change that can’t come soon enough as the current slider method is one of the worst interfaces I’ve tested on a thermostat. Unless you have teeny, tiny fingers, it’s really tricky to manually change the temperature by just one or two degrees; it often jumps around five to 10 instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gh47fW"&gt;Siri on Ecobee officially launches on October 12th and is arriving on Ecobee SmartThermostats over the next few weeks. For the integration to work, you need to have a HomePod on software version 15 and an Ecobee thermostat on firmware 4.7.5.352.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6dRv6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhWKQ1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, October 12th, 11:52 a.m.: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that this integration will not work with an Apple TV or iPad as your only HomeKit hub, it requires a HomePod or HomePod Mini. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scream is back, and Ghostface is better at controlling my smart home than my phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgOv1eI7Nw0fcmJyiSjKuR-nZqo=/580x0:2541x1307/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69984586/scrfp_018r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2KkRp"&gt;He’s back, and he’s coming for you — through your smart home. As if Ghostface’s reappearance after a decade laying dormant wasn’t scary enough, this time, the nineties-self-aware-slasher-killer knows how to control your door locks. And clearly, smart home manufacturers could learn a thing or two from him (or her). This dude’s got some killer protocols on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpdETg"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; dropped today. It’s technically &lt;em&gt;Scream 5&lt;/em&gt;, but apparently, we’re ditching numbers when it comes to horror movie re-boots. And it opens in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; kitchen with another child star home alone. Disney darling Jenna Ortega steps in for the E.T. wunderkind as “Tara,” and while we need to get past the landline phone in the kitchen (what decade is this?), seeing as “Tara” is clearly inhabiting Drew Barrymore’s former pad, we can do that. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ReoY020xjOIH8O1oDvvvS-AelA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920616/scr11900rcr.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neve Campbell and Cortney Cox reunite to battle a tech-savvy killer in the latest Scream installment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8W0iqr"&gt;But this killer is tech-savvy, and the smartphone is Ghostface’s torture tool this time around. In the trailer, Tara texts her buddy “Amber,” who she thinks is pranking her and gets the response: “This isn’t Amber.” Strangely, it isn’t as terrifying in a green bubble as it was in analog times. But don’t you worry, that familiar scary voice is back for more fun and games and, this time, with some impressive home automation scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spMNMR"&gt;In this future world (2022), smart homes work flawlessly, and Ghostface has some hacking skills that can unlock Tara’s front door instantly (hey, it’s a horror movie, not real life). As she backs away from the locked door, her phone helpfully pings her with an audible message: “All Doors Unlocked.” She frantically presses “All Doors Locked” in her generic smart home app (come on, Amazon, there was a killer product placement opportunity here!), and we’re treated to split shots of all these fancy (not smart) deadbolts doing a doorlock dance as killer and victim play smart home roulette. In the smart home, no one can hear your screams of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2szP3KseRdnuoBj6dxhXd0k-SAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920632/scrfp_018r.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostface has some new tricks up his sleeves in the new Scream re-boot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3f8UOz"&gt;Unrealistic smart homes aside, the next clip brings with it the relief that this is not just a schlocky rip-off; this is &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; in all its gory nineties glory. We see Neve Campbell answering her smartphone, and when she utters the words “I’m Sidney Prescott, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I have a gun,” I got literal chills. Gen Xers, rejoice — the whole gang is back. Ex-husband and wife duo David Arquette (as Dewey Riley) and Courtney Cox (as Gale Weathers) team up again with the beleaguered Campbell (Sidney), along with a cast of suitably nubile and stabbable teenage movie stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHH42Z"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; movie is set in the present time 25 years after the original murders (way to make me feel really old, Paramount), and a new killer is stalking the residents of Woodsboro (why does anyone still live there?). It’s the first &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; since creator Wes Craven’s death, and the movie is helmed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. Sadly, there are no Halloween scares on tap; we’ll have to wait until January 14th, 2022 to see the flick in the theaters. But that’s probably a good thing, really. This is not a movie you want to watch at home — and definitely not in a smart home. &lt;/p&gt;
