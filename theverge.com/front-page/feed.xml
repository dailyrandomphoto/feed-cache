    <title>Microsoft is finally fixing Windows 10 rearranging apps on multiple monitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeNHyi9Pmy-wc8G8XvauhLRkKU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200281/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDGjU6"&gt;If you’re a Windows user and you use multiple monitors, you’ve probably experienced the headache of apps randomly rearranging when you resume from sleep. There have been a variety of ways to work around this over the years, but Microsoft is finally addressing it and fixing it in a future Windows 10 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArTIVM"&gt;“The technical terminology we use to describe this problem is known as Rapid Hot Plug Detect (Rapid HPD),” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/avoid-unexpected-app-rearrangement/"&gt;explains Michelle Xiong&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the graphics team at Microsoft. “This behavior impacts DisplayPort multi-monitor setups which results in unwanted desktop rearrangements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE9Cpx"&gt;This problem is particularly troublesome if you’re using a laptop with a secondary screen or an additional monitor goes into deep sleep and Windows thinks it has been unplugged. Windows will then go ahead and move all of your apps onto another screen, and you have to drag them all back manually. It’s a giant headache if you experience the issue daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhPt8Y"&gt;Microsoft has been working on preventing Rapid HPD from rearranging Windows apps, and a fix is coming in the big Windows 10 update that’s due later this year. Windows Insiders can currently get access to this with build 21287 or above, but it does mean running a beta version of the OS on a device. Microsoft is expected to ship this final update in October, but if you can’t wait then you can go ahead and try it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stream President Joe Biden’s first joint address to Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SUMMIT-CLIMATE-DIPLOMACY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8lzSlfosZ9pD8MZvhyVPmhephA=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69200123/1232457998.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xeT4j"&gt;President Biden will deliver his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday. There will be an unusually small crowd in the House chamber due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but the event will be streamed on social media platforms for viewers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdbH4N"&gt;Biden’s speech is expected to touch on a series of administration priorities, including the pandemic, immigration, and tax reform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRyqC2"&gt;Here’s how to watch the address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MNJuVw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE ADDRESS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr2GMa"&gt;Biden’s address will be broadcast across major networks such as CNN, Fox, NBC, PBS, and C-SPAN. The White House will also be streaming the event on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh87V3f0FaA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh87V3f0FaA"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, and on Twitter from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse"&gt;@WhiteHouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/potus"&gt;@POTUS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcFqmR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse"&gt;The Twitter stream&lt;/a&gt; will be accompanied by live on-screen “commentary” from administration officials and cabinet members, according to Rob Flaherty, White House director of digital strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKbZV4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN DOES THE ADDRESS START?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0u6DF"&gt;Biden’s first joint address at the US Capitol will begin at 9PM ET on Wednesday, April 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T7t3Bu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE OF THE UNION?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VFnUGN"&gt;It’s traditional for a president’s first address to Congress to be called a “joint address” rather than the State of the Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuaXQK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It took Google 526 days to give you a way to search through Stadia’s 172 games</title>

Over the past two decades, the idea of “googling something” has become a standard part of language, so dominant has Google’s search engine become in popular culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2gamz"&gt;On an unrelated note, today — 526 days after its initial launch — Google has finally added a &lt;a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/Search-Now-on-Stadia-More-Updates-Coming-Soon/ba-p/59259"&gt;search bar to the Stadia store&lt;/a&gt; to better allow customers to search through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Stadia_games"&gt;the 172 games currently available&lt;/a&gt; on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h3R0io"&gt;In addition to the new, revolutionary search bar (which Google says will be reaching all players this week), Stadia is also debuting a new way to sort players’ libraries to track purchased, free, and Stadia Pro games. The company also teased an upcoming activity feed that it plans to roll out in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google expands its Android-based earthquake detection system </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Android" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ukmXoKZ9hPuePxDgZt89sRczIo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199998/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google is turning Android phones into an earthquake detection system. | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYWw01"&gt;Google is expanding its Android-based earthquake detection and alert system, filling in gaps in places where there are few seismometers and no early warning systems. Starting today, the program that launched in California last year will also&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;be available in Greece and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ik8YvR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Filling in gaps in places where there are few seismometers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTmWM4"&gt;This also marks a new step for Google; it’s the first time the company will handle everything from detecting the earthquake to warning individuals. Android devices will first sense waves generated by quakes. Google then analyzes data from the phones and sends out an early warning alert to users in the affected area. Users will get the alerts automatically unless they opt out of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDIHgd"&gt;When Google started on this endeavor, it worked with the United States Geological Survey and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services to send earthquake alerts to Android users in California. This feature is now available in Oregon and will expand to Washington in May. Last year, Google started gathering earthquake data from phones. It then used that data to provide information to users if they searched for “earthquake” or “earthquake near me” on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOd6oK"&gt;Google’s system works because each phone is already equipped with an accelerometer, which can detect movement. The accelerometer can also detect primary and secondary earthquake waves, almost acting as a “mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/earthquake-detection-and-alerts/"&gt;according to Google&lt;/a&gt;. Seismometers are devices that detect ground movement, like earthquakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV0hmm"&gt;“It’d be great if there were just seismometer-based systems everywhere that could detect earthquakes,” Marc Stogaitis, principle Android software engineer at Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. Because of costs and maintenance, he says, “that’s not really practical and it’s unlikely to have global coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fQZMo8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"ANDROID IS BECOMING A WORLDWIDE EARTHQUAKE DETECTION NETWORK ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hzhyzO"&gt;There are some limitations to Google’s system. People closest to the quake probably won’t get much advance warning since they’ll be the first ones to detect the quake. But their phones will help give a heads-up to others farther away, giving them crucial time to take shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8eU6U"&gt;Android is the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/#:~:text=Android%20maintained%20its%20position%20as,of%20the%20global%20market%20share."&gt;leading OS system&lt;/a&gt; for smartphones, so this service has a lot of room to grow. Eventually, Google could develop an API based on its earthquake detection system that could have farther-reaching effects. Other systems could use the API to let people off an elevator or open firehouse doors before losing power, Dieter Bohn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year. That’s still pretty far off but could make a huge difference in keeping people safe during future earthquakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2sFOb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite isn’t on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service because Epic won’t allow it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1IXL97pCj_KXyutCiHFTERY06GY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199963/vpavic_180607_2652_0045.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XhuwF4"&gt;Epic Games is holding back &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from being available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new deposition made public as part of the Epic case against Apple. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer views Microsoft’s xCloud service as competition to its PC offerings, and the company is deliberately not offering &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on xCloud as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNunvV"&gt;Joe Kreiner, Epic’s vice president of business development, was questioned over why &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;isn’t available on xCloud, and confirmed it was a deliberate choice. “We viewed Microsoft’s efforts with xCloud to be competitive with our PC offerings,” says Kreiner in the deposition. The court document makes it appear like Kreiner may go on to explain why, but the next part of the questioning has been redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaUhWx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a free-to-play game on Xbox, and the only way to currently access the game on an iPhone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;through Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service&lt;/a&gt;. Epic Games partnered with Nvidia last year to launch &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on GeForce Now and has helped Nvidia offer a number of other games from its PC game store on the Nvidia cloud gaming service, where all of the revenue from the original game’s purchase or any in-app purchases goes back to Epic rather than Nvidia. As far as Epic is concerned, the game is simply running on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ic6VPi"&gt;That is likely a key reason why Epic has favored Nvidia over Microsoft to host &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;in the cloud. Microsoft doesn’t currently allow rival game stores on Xbox or xCloud in any form, and all transactions go through Microsoft there. In fact, Kreiner even admits that Epic Games hasn’t tried to negotiate with Microsoft over the requirement to have to use the Xbox maker’s store and commerce engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9177sp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;Epic’s entire case against Apple&lt;/a&gt; is centered on the App Store, and the company believes Apple should allow rival app stores on iOS devices or rival payment processing platforms. Epic is trying to fight Apple’s App Store policies, a 30 percent (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;15 percent for some&lt;/a&gt;) cut for subscriptions and in-app purchases, and the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store. Kreiner’s questioning is part of this ongoing lawsuit, and it’s a huge case that’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;shining a light&lt;/a&gt; on the practices throughout the mobile and game industry that result in consumers being able to access games and apps across devices beyond just the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccines should be the new bobbleheads at every sporting event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Philadelphia 76ers v Milwaukee Bucks" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NUkpD-kFcW-ZCMA_RB_vAe7z5eQ=/0x0:7680x5120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199923/1232505309.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sKlbe0"&gt;I’m proud of the Milwaukee Bucks for winning their game against the Hornets &lt;a href="https://www.brewhoop.com/2021/4/27/22406656/rapid-recap-bucks-hornets-milwaukee-charlotte-final-score-april-27-2021"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m also really proud of them for setting up a mobile COVID-19 vaccination site for their next home game. On Sunday, any fan in attendance can get their first dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine through a partnership with the Milwaukee Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgsIsO"&gt;Game attendance is capped at 3,266 people, and the arena’s general manager Dennis Williams &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/04/27/bucks-vaccinations-home-game-nets/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the organization hopes to vaccinate at least a few hundred people. Facility employees will be able to get a shot as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VuImO"&gt;“It was important to try to capture as many people as possible,” Williams said, “and what better way than a Bucks game that sees 600 to 800 employees on top of the 3,266 who will be here on Sunday as well?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K8rTfD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bucks and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKEhealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MKEhealth&lt;/a&gt; to Offer COVID-19 Vaccinations at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiservForum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FiservForum&lt;/a&gt; to Eligible Fans Attending Sunday's Game &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZxNhPRmQK5"&gt;https://t.co/ZxNhPRmQK5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bucks/status/1387081092482621443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DNVwHx"&gt;Setting aside the initial decision to allow fans in an indoor arena at all without requiring that they be vaccinated first (fun police alert: it is still unfortunately a pandemic! Sorry!) — this is great. The New Orleans Pelicans are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nba.com%2Fpelicans%2Fnews%2Fochsner-health-host-covid-19-vaccination-events-upcoming-pelicans-games&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407753%2Fcovid-vaccine-milwaukee-bucks-arena-nba" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting vaccination events&lt;/a&gt; at games as well, so I’m also proud of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNHy9V"&gt;The pace of vaccinations in the Untied States is starting to slow down now that almost all of the people most eager to be vaccinated have gotten their shots. The next phase of the campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399889/vaccine-supply-demand-antivirus-newsletter-covid"&gt;is harder&lt;/a&gt;: reaching people who may want to be vaccinated but aren’t actively seeking it out. Getting that group vaccinated will take new tactics and will mean giving people as many easy opportunities to roll up their sleeves as possible. That includes opening up walk-in appointments at pharmacies, making vaccines available at doctors’ offices, and putting mobile clinics at places where people spend their time — including sporting events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTZQDI"&gt;I hope to be offered a vaccine over the next few months more often than I’m offered random advertisement fliers on the streets of New York. Make a shot the new giveaway at every sporting event — save the bobbleheads for next season. Or put a Band-Aid on the bobbleheads and hand them out, too, if that seems more fun. Just give people as many places and ways to get vaccinated as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram’s group video calls will finally launch in May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixIbVRqXLhoVbk-Qj50vBt2inbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199888/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCa1EK"&gt;Telegram CEO Pavel Durov &lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/160"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that the iOS version of Telegram will be updated to support group video calls in May (&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/telegram-add-group-video-calls-125053371.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company originally planned to add the video call feature to its messaging service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234254/telegram-messaging-app-group-video-calling-security-usability"&gt;at some point in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature never materialized. Telegram did at least make it into the new year with one video call addition: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370420/telegram-video-calls-os-android"&gt;end-to-end encrypted one-on-one video calls&lt;/a&gt; were added in August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXaM55"&gt;Durov’s announcement of the new launch date was shared — naturally — in his personal Telegram channel. He writes that group video calls will have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jxGndK"&gt;Screen sharing, encryption, noise-cancelling, desktop and tablet support — everything you can expect from a modern video conferencing tool, but with Telegram-level UI, speed and encryption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qGq5qq"&gt;Telegram already offers end-to-end encryption on its one-on-one video calling, but the company hasn’t explicitly confirmed the feature here. We’ve reached out to confirm that it plans to offer the same on group video calls when they launch in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc4J8B"&gt;Telegram has grown significantly over the pandemic, taking advantage of the shift to working from home and the general desire to stay connected securely. The company announced it reached &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/400-million"&gt;400 million monthly active users&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, up from &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/200-million"&gt;200 million in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Some of that has to do with its competitor, WhatsApp, fumbling how it communicated its new privacy policy to customers, which inspired some users to leave the Facebook-owned app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;for Telegram and Signal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tihane"&gt;Despite seeming a bit less nimble, WhatsApp actually beat Telegram to offering end-to-end encrypted group video calls. The company&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17632650/whatsapp-group-video-calling-feature-now-live"&gt; added group video and voice calling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces a cheaper entry-level Galaxy Book with no OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cfxlt71RR0VuLgL1KjMbk_Dp56g=/1x0:3799x2532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199782/Galaxy_Book_15inch_MysticBlue_WiFi_Top_Wide_Open_210417022709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book comes in silver or this sleek blue color&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXPBjX"&gt;Samsung announced two entry-level Galaxy Book laptops at its Unpacked event: the Galaxy Book and the Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha. The former will start at around $800 (according to Samsung, that price is subject to change) and will launch in the second half of 2021, whereas the Flex2 Alpha starts at $849 and is available for preorder now, shipping in mid-May. These round out the fleet of premium models announced today, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360&lt;/a&gt; with OLED screens that start at $999, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407647/samsungs-galaxy-book-odyssey-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu"&gt;$1,399 Galaxy Book Odyssey gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; that’s the first to sport Nvidia’s new RTX 3050 Ti graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7iI7N"&gt;Starting with the Galaxy Book, it has a 15.6-inch 1080p TFT LCD display, and it supports up to two fast NVMe SSDs. It has two USB-C ports (one of which can recharge the laptop with the included 65W charger), two USB-A 3.2 ports, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and an optional nano SIM tray for LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The silver color of the Galaxy Book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CxVrla"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/mediaresources/galaxy_book/techspecs"&gt;Samsung’s mobile press site&lt;/a&gt; shows that the Intel Pentium Gold or Celeron processor may show up in some models globally, but the company hasn’t confirmed what will be in the starting configuration in the US. A Samsung spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the final price and specs will be announced closer to its launch in the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2Nso2"&gt;According to the site linked above, if you need more power, you’ll be able to bump it up to 11th Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, with the option of taking advantage of their Iris Xe integrated graphics, or you can opt for Nvidia’s GeForce MX450 discrete graphics. The Galaxy Book can be upgraded to 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUvkoS"&gt;Rounding out the specs, the Galaxy Book comes in silver or blue, and every configuration will have a 54Wh battery. Similar to the Galaxy Book Pro lineup, this one supports Dolby Atmos audio. Its webcam is a 720p HD sensor with a dual array mic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o6rMz98wvPgYWczG0sNnkak92O8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475568/Galaxy_Book_Flex2_Alpha_012_R_Perspective_Windows_Mystic_Black_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha will launch in black, blue, or silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RGpWxM"&gt;If you want a 2-in-1 laptop with a better QLED screen that’s still not as expensive as the Galaxy Book Pro, Samsung also announced two sizes (13.3 and 15.6 inches) of the new Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha. Each model has a 1080p QLED display, and either Intel’s 11th Gen i5 or i7 processors. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-book-flex/buy/?modelCode=NP730QDA-KA1US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The price for the 13-inch model starts at $849&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6YSBX"&gt;The starting configuration includes 8GB of RAM, but supports up to 16GB, and the storage tops out at 512GB. It has a standard selection of ports, including two USB-A 3.0 ports, a USB-C port, a headphone jack, a power plug, HDMI, and a microSD slot. Like the Galaxy Book, this model also has a 54Wh battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The UAW wants to unionize EV startup factory workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a-fzntkO1szOZiAz5oFNF4dZEU=/0x89:3708x2561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199762/2019_03_normal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHS9IN"&gt;The United Auto Workers union is “laying the groundwork” to organize factory workers that will build electric vehicles for startups like Rivian and Lucid Motors, president Rory Gamble told &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/with-biden-as-an-ally-uaw-union-prepares-to-battle-for-ev-jobs.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGzTkz"&gt;“That’s a given. We are formulating plans to go out to all these start-ups to give these workers a voice,” he said. “In today’s world, you have to think out of the box in how you reach people. We really have to drive home the benefits of belonging to the union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9JtCF"&gt;Gamble declined to say what those plans involve, according to CNBC. The UAW did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Representatives for Rivian, Lucid Motors, Faraday Future, and Lordstown Motors did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CwNyF"&gt;Factory workers who build cars for legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors, and others have long been part of the UAW. But that’s not been the case for newer automakers in the US. The factory Tesla operates was once jointly owned by Toyota and GM, and its workforce was represented by the UAW. But when Tesla bought the shuttered factory after the recession in 2010, it &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/01/11/tesla-not-buying-gm-factory-union-employees-ceo/"&gt;rebuilt the workforce without a union&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZJH3jb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The UAW long fought, but ultimately failed, to organize workers at Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7r2nbv"&gt;Since then, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has maintained that his factory workers are better off without union representation. He once wrote that the UAW “does not share our mission,” and claimed its “true allegiance is to the giant car companies, where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla.” (The UAW collects monthly dues ranging from 0.805 percent to 1.44 percent of a worker’s monthly earnings, depending &lt;a href="https://uaw.org/dues-faq/"&gt;on a number of factors&lt;/a&gt;.) The National Labor Relations Board ultimately ruled that Musk’s comments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351157/tesla-elon-musk-delete-anti-union-tweet-national-labor-relations-board"&gt;should be considered union-busting and broke the law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEHfXr"&gt;While a lot of attention has recently been paid to organizing efforts in tech and media industries, the number of non-government employees who belong to a union has fallen slightly over the last decade. The labor rights movement took an especially public hit earlier this month when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;a push to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama overwhelmingly failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt2gwf"&gt;Similarly high-profile efforts to unionize in the auto industry have also recently failed, like when the UAW tried to organize workers at &lt;a href="https://www.labornotes.org/2017/08/why-did-nissan-workers-vote-no"&gt;a Nissan plant in Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 or at Volkswagen’s plant in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/15/733074989/tennessee-workers-reject-union-at-volkswagen-plant-again"&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmp8j9"&gt;There are a number of EV startups that plan to build their vehicles in the United States. But, like Tesla, they have been assembling non-unionized workforces ahead of production at their respective factories. Many of them are also now flush with cash thanks to big investments or mergers with publicly traded special purpose acquisition companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nkw63"&gt;Rivian, which is backed by Amazon and is the most well-funded of the bunch, is supposed to start assembling its electric pickup truck and SUV at a former Mitsubishi plant it bought in Normal, Illinois. Saudi Arabia-backed Lucid Motors will build its electric luxury sedan at a massive new factory it’s building in Casa Grande, Arizona. Faraday Future, which is going public sometime before the end of June, is partway through refurbishing and retooling a former Pirelli tire plant in Hanford, California, where it will build its luxury SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqIPcf"&gt;One of the youngest EV startups in the country, Lordstown Motors, bought a shuttered GM factory in Lordstown, Ohio that was previously operated by UAW workers. The company’s CEO Steve Burns has said he was considering rehiring some of that workforce, but he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; that it would be up to them whether they want to unionize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3PldS"&gt;“[I]t isn’t our call, but in case they do, we will embrace it and make sure the union knows what we’re trying to accomplish and see how we can work together to hit it out of the park,” Burns said. “The culture of the place is union, you know, the history. So we anticipate that to happen, to have union representation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OM3pum"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccinations are keeping older Americans out of hospitals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojS5Tefn4W87NmjSjAybaZE6MYE=/64x0:5739x3783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69199750/1232342354.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wKZS8Y"&gt;Two shots of a COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization by 94 percent for people over 65, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7018e1.htm?s_cid=mm7018e1_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=usCDC_921-DM55819&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20April%2028%2C%202021&amp;amp;deliveryName=usCDC_921-DM55819"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4H0nv"&gt;That age group is at the highest risk of severe cases of COVID-19 — that’s why it was prioritized for the early waves of vaccination in the United States. Keeping that age group out of the hospital would go a long way to drive down the hospitalization rates from the disease overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2SAqj"&gt;The analysis looked at people hospitalized at 24 hospitals in 14 states during January, February, and March. It included 417 hospitalized patients, 187 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 and 230 who did not. Partial vaccination, defined in this case as having a first dose two weeks before starting to feel sick, was 64 percent effective against hospitalization. The shots were 94 percent effective for people who were fully vaccinated, two weeks out from their second dose. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Graphic showing that two doses of the vaccine reduces hospitalization risk from COVID-19 by 94 percent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCMV54J651YXgGRETISjy_wGz_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475544/mm7018e1_EffectivenessOlderAdults_IMAGE_28Apr21_1200x675.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5oZdMw"&gt;The data is consistent with the clinical trials testing the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which found that the shots would keep people out of the hospital. But because only a small percentage of people with COVID-19 need to be hospitalized, the trials themselves&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;didn’t have enough data to say how well they prevent hospitalization in the 65-plus age group, the CDC report notes. This real-world analysis adds more data to answer that question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni2OSC"&gt;The study is yet another sign that the COVID-19 vaccines are overwhelmingly effective. Other data collected over the past few months found that the shots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;protect against infection&lt;/a&gt; with the coronavirus, not just symptomatic disease, and that they work well against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395551/covid-vaccine-breakthrough-infection-rare-cdc"&gt;variant forms&lt;/a&gt; of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnUrBh"&gt;Around 68 percent of people over 65 in the United States are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
