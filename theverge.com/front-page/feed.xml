    <title>Meet the auto repair professor pivoting to EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEEf008xJcbOxJYOlezl0gX2C6U=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426327/Ruth_Morrison1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xsKaVg"&gt;With the number of electric vehicles on the roads poised to skyrocket this decade, millions of drivers are going to need auto mechanics who can fix their new batteries-on-wheels. But today, the &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/10/97-of-auto-mechanics-cant-work-on-electric-cars-new-report-concludes/?utm_source=Triggermail&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Post%20Blast%20bii-transportation-and-logistics:%20Tesla%20owners%20dissatisfied%20with%20wait%20for%20services%20%7C%20Ford%20will%20use%20over-the-air%20updates%20in%202020%20%7C%20US%20govt%20grounds%20Chinese%20drones&amp;amp;utm_term=BII%20List%20T%26L%20ALL"&gt;vast majority of auto repair professionals&lt;/a&gt; do not have the training or equipment to repair EVs, which are anatomically very different from their gas-powered predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EI8JQ"&gt;As a result, many early EV adopters have been forced to rely on vehicle manufacturers and dealerships to service their cars — a situation that can &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/your-money/26shortcuts.html"&gt;drive up repair costs&lt;/a&gt; and lead to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-owners-dissatisfied-with-wait-for-services-2019-11"&gt;frustratingly long wait times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1HEqQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smccme.edu/faculty-profiles/#morrison"&gt;Ruth Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, who chairs the &lt;a href="https://www.smccme.edu/academics/degree-programs/automotive-technology/#cert"&gt;Automotive Technology Department&lt;/a&gt; at Southern Maine Community College (SMCC), wants to change that. Morrison, who was an auto mechanic before she began teaching in 2003, took a course focused on hybrid and EV repair back in 2009. She’s wanted to teach the subject ever since. And with SMCC recently receiving funds from the state for additional workforce training, she now has the opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8dUfT"&gt;Last month, SMCC did its first run of a new class designed to teach mechanics to work on hybrid and electric vehicles — the first in Maine, to Morrison’s knowledge, and one of a relatively small number of such programs nationwide. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Morrison to learn more about what her course offers and the fast-evolving EV repair landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEOtdk"&gt;This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJrEdr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;We’re on the cusp of a huge electric vehicle boom in the United States and also globally. What are the implications of that for independent auto repair? What new skills are mechanics going to have to learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIrGaR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;[Electric vehicles] have different components. They’re going to require different equipment and tools, and technicians are going to need to get trained in how to use them. The safety concerns are one issue, but then, the equipment we use in this class is specific to diagnosing the electric machines [motors or generators], the power inverters, and the batteries. And if independent shops want to get into repairing these components, rather than just putting in a whole new unit, then they’re going to need to get training in this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJxzke"&gt;Which is different from what the dealerships have been doing. Dealerships will generally replace an entire battery rather than try and balance it or replace the cells and balance it after that. As there’s more of these vehicles that are outside of warranty, and people are buying them used, I would think that the consumers are going to want to spend less money and not have to foot the bill for the entire component, just get it repaired. And then, if somebody is buying a used car, it’s nice to know what condition it’s in before buying it. So there’s some predictive maintenance that can be done to see how the motor is, kind of like doing a compression test on a gasoline engine or a diesel engine. If you want to know how worn the engine is before you buy the car, you can do some sort of predictive testing. And for electric vehicles, there’s also predictive testing that can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOoFam"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;How did your idea for a course focused on training independent mechanics on electric vehicles first come about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enWGWc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, I first took a class in [2009] with Dr. Quarto, who came and did training for us, and I wanted to start offering that training to our students. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: Dr. Mark Quarto is a former General Motors engineer who teaches EV and hybrid vehicle repair through &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.futuretechauto.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a company called FutureTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.] And there’s special tools that we had to buy. There was an expense involved, and I didn’t get a lot of support for getting tools up in order to do that. But now the Maine Community College System has &lt;a href="https://www.mccs.me.edu/press_release/president-daigler-statement-on-governor-signing-legislation-to-implement-maine-jobs-and-recovery-plan/"&gt;received support&lt;/a&gt; from the governor of Maine, and she wants us to be training in green jobs, and so now we have the ability to buy the equipment and get ourselves trained, and that’s really opened the door for us. I’ve been struggling to fit this into our budget for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWZbAk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;As you developed the course, were there any other programs you modeled it after or took inspiration from? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBH9lk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, what happened was &lt;a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html"&gt;Siemens&lt;/a&gt; was involved with a chain called VIP Tires and Service, which is up here in the Northeast, and VIP had approached Siemens for guidance on getting their technicians trained in this area. So they [Siemens] approached me in summer of 2019 and asked us if we could train the technicians. And so then I started working directly with VIP, and the first thing I thought of was this course that I had taken with Dr. Quarto years ago. I looked around for other curriculum rather than reinventing one, and I liked his the best. So we have modeled it after the training his company offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZ6O9t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;Did you find many other EV repair courses out there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm2Bea"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s a few. I know that there’s one in Worcester, Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.fixhybrid.com/training-calendar/"&gt;called ACDC&lt;/a&gt;. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The Verge was unable to find data on how many EV and hybrid repair training programs exist nationally. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RebuildsRich"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rich Benoit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, co-founder of the Tesla-focused repair shop The Electrified Garage, told &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; in an email he suspects there are “under 50 dedicated EV repair programs in the US.&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg9yhD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;Walk me through the nuts and bolts of how your course works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MghjH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;So when we first rolled this out for VIP, it was [also] a “train the trainer” event for me and my partner, Joe. What we did was use the web-based training from FutureTech — all of us did that web-based training first — then Dr. Quarto came and did a week-long hands-on class. That was back in December. And I think as we go forward, I’m going to break that big class down into smaller pieces. Because it was a lot of web-based training before we got to the hands-on. If we can break it down into systems, I think that would be a lot easier to offer to the general public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql7bua"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;Can you highlight a few things mechanics learn in the course?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqTbHW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure. We went through the safety systems first — understanding how those worked and checking them to make sure they were working properly. And then, we did battery testing and balancing or reconditioning. So you can take an older battery and recondition it, and it’ll be much better for many years. And then we looked at motor generators and diagnosing those; we looked at power inverters and the air conditioning compressors. Pretty much all of the high voltage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cifjxH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;When it comes to battery balancing, is the idea that we can take batteries from older vehicles and do a heart transplant into a newer vehicle? Or is it more about rehabilitating the battery to remain in the same vehicle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhJLqU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;Both. So, somebody who drives a Prius might notice after five years that their gas mileage has gone down significantly. And that’s because the gas engine is powering the powertrain rather than the electric motor because the battery doesn’t have enough power anymore. So that battery in that vehicle could be reconditioned and bring it back up to its original condition. And then the gas mileage would go back to 45 [mpg] or whatever it started out at. And then also, one of the things we did during our class was get a couple batteries from salvage yards and reconditioned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YCkJi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;What kind of feedback did you receive on the course from the folks who took it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJHsHt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;The company VIP, the technicians learned a lot. They’re ready to set up these services at their shops. They have enough hybrids, Priuses coming through their shops on a regular basis. They could be selling these services — the maintenance services, the predictive maintenance, and the repair services. It’s applicable knowledge that they can start offering for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hNlDL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you have additional courses planned for later this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHlj9D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, with the grant, we need to start training more people. I think we said it was going to be about a hundred people. By the time we were done in the next year or so, we’re going to start offering courses outside of our regular curriculum. So that would mostly be in the summer and maybe during our winter break again next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYfTLY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maddie: &lt;/strong&gt;The right-to-repair movement has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2021.1896669?journalCode=rael20"&gt;played a pretty big role&lt;/a&gt; in opening up the independent auto repair landscape, but some repair advocates are concerned that with the EV transition, &lt;a href="https://grist.org/politics/tesla-want-to-fix-your-own-massachusetts-just-made-it-easier/"&gt;new repair restrictions could start to emerge&lt;/a&gt;. Are the mechanics you’re talking with bringing up any particular challenges repairing electric cars? Are there restrictions on these vehicles, or vehicle data that they’re not getting from manufacturers, that’s making repair harder? Is that something you’re concerned about in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5zI6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth: &lt;/strong&gt;I haven’t run into a problem yet. But yes, I mean, it’s always a problem. As an automotive technician, it’s always a problem to try and get the substantial information that you need and the diagnostic information. [EVs] are going to have the same challenge for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase makes it easier to report cryptocurrency taxes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pvCLPg6W5VVFOdCybrtJkB9tX5E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426322/acastro_180927_2968_Coinbase_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIGjhJ"&gt;Coinbase, one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding a new tax center to its app and website to help US customers work out how much they might owe to the IRS as a result of their crypto transactions, the company has announced. The section is designed to gather every taxable transaction into one place to simplify matters come tax day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hqKtd"&gt;Although cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often appear similar to the fiat money we’re accustomed to, in the eyes of the IRS, the digital assets are actually property, according to &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions"&gt;this FAQ&lt;/a&gt; from the federal agency. That means cryptocurrency transactions may need to be reported as capital gains or losses, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; means keeping track of a cryptocurrency’s value as it’s bought and sold over time. Documenting these transactions can get complicated quickly if you’re regularly buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xcfaya"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The information can be passed to an accountant or used with tax software&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgWtew"&gt;According to Coinbase, its new section will show “a personalized summary of [a customer’s] taxable activity on Coinbase, broken out over time by realized gains/losses and miscellaneous income.” This information can then be taken to an accountant or used with tax software like TurboTax. If you’re someone who’s transferred crypto to external exchanges, wallets, or other DeFi (decentralized finance) services, then Coinbase says its customers can also get tax reports for up to 3,000 of these transactions &lt;a href="https://www.cointracker.io/coinbase"&gt;free with CoinTracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLpnX0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/irs-new-rules-on-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-trading.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; on suspicions that a lot of the taxes due on cryptocurrency transactions are going unpaid. Although confusion about the evolving tax rules about cryptocurrencies is one reason for this, another is that exchanges like Coinbase have historically not given as much help as traditional brokerage houses to customers when it comes to reporting their gains and losses for tax purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Np0QtG"&gt;The new Coinbase tax section is accessible from the profile icon in the top right-hand corner of the interface, where “Taxes” will appear as a menu item. In its app, the Taxes section is accessible from the “Profile &amp;amp; Settings” menu, accessible from the top left of the app’s interface. In addition to the new tools, Coinbase is also planning to offer written guides and help videos in the coming weeks to explain cryptocurrency and digital asset taxes, but for now, this &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-taxes-in-2022/"&gt;overview from &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Blink outdoor cameras with floodlight and solar-charging configurations are $50 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blink Floodlight Cam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QuaJYDnSagCLW_DNH5d5uo9ePy4=/40x0:1155x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426284/Blink_Flood_Light_Cam_1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mZNMmI"&gt;Mondays are for football hangovers, extra strong coffee, and deals. If the weekend brought you grief due to some big playoff upsets, we’re here to ease the pain with great savings on gadgets. What better way to dull the sting of an abysmal 13-10 loss to the sixth seed when you’re supposed to be the favorite to win it all? Put down the cheese and dry those tears with some excellent deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="512vpf"&gt;First up, the latest Blink Outdoor cam with a floodlight attachment is currently just $89.98 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Floodlight-Camera/dp/B094YXVVRF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgub0TC81Bm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50 less than its regular price of $139.98. It comes equipped with a 700-lumen LED floodlight and the Sync Module 2 for connectivity. If you want to make battery anxiety a thing of the past, the Blink Outdoor camera with a solar charger mount is just $79.98 (also $50 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Solar-Panel-Charging/dp/B099HXDWZS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cguca3anb1U" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the same camera in a configuration that pretty much ensures you may never swap batteries (though you have to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy your Sync Module separately for about $35&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff1CLA"&gt;If you’ve considered outdoor smart home cameras, you probably encountered the conundrum of going wireless and dealing with limited battery life or going wired and dealing with installation. These cameras from Blink offer a convenient compromise, with battery life that lasts up to two years on just two 1.5-volt AA lithium batteries. They may not offer some of the extra features like person detection or package detection, but they nail the essentials with motion detection and 1080p video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DxE2cw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why does Blink still exist?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22704290/amazon-blink-ring-camera-doorbell-brands-smart-home-why"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="nDvb7o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10993169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UJHwqo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10993173"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pC2h0U"&gt;The most basic Apple AirPods are still a fine choice in 2022, especially when they drop down to a price as affordable as one Benjamin. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the second-gen AirPods with a wired charging case for $99.99&lt;/a&gt; — saving you about $29 off the usual going rate. The only time that price gets any better is around Black Friday or maybe Prime Day. These AirPods from 2019 have been leap-frogged in performance by the excellent AirPods Pro (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which are currently discounted to $179.99&lt;/a&gt;) and usurped by the newer third-gen model, but they’re still readily available and a worthwhile pickup if you have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac and value the convenience of their excellent connectivity and audible Siri notifications. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dw1Sda"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LD2zi"&gt;Speaking of Apple’s products that perform well for their price and size, the popular &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/homepod-mini.product.100696292.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HomePod Mini is just $79.99&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off) at Costco in either white or space gray. This deal is exclusive for Costco members with a limit of three per member and costs another $2.99 for shipping. The HomePod Mini is the diminutive smart speaker from Apple that supports Siri voice commands, easy HomeKit integration for smart home connectivity, and solid audio quality from a small speaker — complete with multi-speaker pairing. It’s the only smart speaker currently on offer from Apple since its larger sibling was discontinued in 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lJE19a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHnYFX"&gt;If you’re getting started a little early on securing a new TV before the Super Bowl, the deals are slowly beginning to trickle in.

That is an exceptional value for the larger Nest Hub with bigger sound output that also works great for video calls. One of the killer features of Google’s displays is the integration with Google Photos, allowing the screensaver to be automatically populated by a shared album — and that experience is maximized with the big display of the Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An OpenSea bug let attackers snatch Apes from owners at six-figure discounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of NFTs falling into a sack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PYOMgyz3lwxP5YYu6bOBMYrILk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426146/acastro_210914_4753_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fsD8Vh"&gt;A bug in OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, has let hackers buy rare NFTs for well below market value, in some cases leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for the original owners — and hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits for the apparent thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPY739"&gt;The bug appears to have been present for weeks and seems to be referenced in at least one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carsonturner/status/1477414895834513413"&gt;tweet from January 1st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. But exploitation of the bug has picked up significantly in the past day: blockchain analytics company Elliptic reported that in a 12-hour stretch before the morning of January 24th, it was exploited at least eight times to &lt;a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/bug-allows-nfts-worth-over-1-million-to-be-stolen"&gt;“steal” NFTs with a market value of over $1 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg3zd7"&gt;One of the NFTs, &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/9991"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club #9991&lt;/a&gt;, was purchased using the exploit technique for 0.77 ETH ($1,760) and quickly resold for 84.2 ETH ($192,400), netting the attacker a profit of more than $190,000. An &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1a22cc48f6784f629a994917cd6474923630c48#internaltx"&gt;Ethereum address&lt;/a&gt; linked to the reseller had received more than 400 ETH ($904,000) in payouts from OpenSea in the same 12-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCaXNE"&gt;“It’s a subjective thing whether you consider this to be a loophole or a bug, but the fact is that people are being forced into sales at a price they wouldn’t otherwise have accepted right now,” said Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQKnrY"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yakirrotem/status/1485559872242565121"&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; by software developer Rotem Yakir, the bug is caused by a mismatch between the information available in NFT smart contracts and the information presented by OpenSea’s user interface. Essentially, the attackers are taking advantage of old contracts that persist on the blockchain but are no longer present in the view provided by the OpenSea application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJXWCW"&gt;OpenSea users sell NFTs by setting a “list price” for potential buyers to see. Due to the nature of smart contracts, if a buyer accepts that list price, the NFT is automatically transferred to them. If an owner wants to re-list an NFT for a higher sale price, the proper way to do this is to cancel the first listing, which costs a “&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nft-investing-crypto-art-what-is-a-gas-fee-explained-2021-3"&gt;gas fee&lt;/a&gt;” that might be in the tens or even hundreds of dollars, so some users had skirted around this by transferring the NFT to another wallet, then back to the original wallet. While this technique apparently removed the listing from the information in OpenSea’s front-end display, the original listing remained active on the blockchain and could allegedly be found through the OpenSea API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsssZK"&gt;The bug was discovered as early as December 31st, 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/24/opensea-bug-allows-attacker-to-get-massive-discount-on-popular-nfts/"&gt;according to CoinDesk&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GinoTheGhost/status/1481461462350532609"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from almost two weeks ago on January 12th, 2022, details the forced sale of NFTs via the same method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqcSWO"&gt;It’s unclear whether OpenSea is treating the situation as an open security flaw or a result of user error. The company did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T’s new 5-gig and 2-gig fiber internet is here, starting at $110 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvlIWG6HpbO56w2vES3zlvcZmH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426119/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K66hn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/fastest-major-internet-provider.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is rolling out 2Gbps and 5Gbps&lt;/a&gt; speed tiers for its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/fiber/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fiber-optic internet option&lt;/a&gt;. The company made the announcement to kick off its Life Gigified event, where it said new and existing AT&amp;amp;T Fiber customers will soon be able to take advantage of these multi-gig connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrdTWF"&gt;If you don’t know what multi-gig is, it means a single connection that offers speeds higher than 1Gbps. AT&amp;amp;T’s new multi-gig speeds need Wi-Fi 6 technology for “optimal” performance, which means you’ll probably want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283756/arris-surfboard-max-pro-wi-fi-6-mesh-router-review-price-specs-features"&gt;upgrade your router&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, AT&amp;amp;T has a new “All-Fi” device ready. The company may offer even faster speeds eventually; AT&amp;amp;T says it reached speeds of 10Gbps in a lab environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="58w0YC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2Gbps plan will cost $110 / month, while the 5Gbps plan is priced at $180 / month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlytlu"&gt;The 2Gbps plan will cost $110 / month, while the 5Gbps plan is priced at $180 / month. Business plans will cost a bit more, however, at $225 / month for 2GB speeds and $395 / month for 5Gbps. AT&amp;amp;T is also introducing “straightforward pricing” for all of its Fiber plans, which it says will eliminate equipment fees, annual contracts, data caps, and 12-month price increases for new customers. Its new plans come with a free HBO Max subscription as well as &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ActiveArmor&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T’s cybersecurity service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBVu5e"&gt;These new speed tiers will be available in over 70 metro areas, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Dallas. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/gigapower/coverage-map/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offers its fiber-optic network&lt;/a&gt; near cities spread out across the Southern, Midwestern, and Western portions of the US, but it plans to expand its service network to 30 million customers by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftkfTK"&gt;Previously, AT&amp;amp;T’s fiber-optic speeds ranged from 300Mbps to 1Gbps. Its move into multi-gig territory follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437958/google-fiber-2-gig-gbps-internet-nashville-huntsville-speed-webpass-pilot"&gt;Google Fiber’s 2Gbps rollout&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 as well as Comcast’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Flearn%2Foffers%2Fdetails%3FofferId%3D9626100376&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F24%2F22898876%2Fatt-fiber-multi-gig-connections-speeds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;3Gbps offering for $299 / month&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T offers more information about the new speeds &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/http://att.com/hypergig" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta has built an AI supercomputer it says will be world’s fastest by end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Prineville Data Center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4yfABuwLxw9tquqNnqqVYvtQHA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426006/vpavic_160712_1138_0079.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zjq47W"&gt;Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBIDfC"&gt;“Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuL4ri"&gt;The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-uks-most-powerful-supercomputer-for-research-in-ai-and-healthcare"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CtlzOh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCVLel"&gt;“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more,” write Meta engineers Kevin Lee and Shubho Sengupta in a &lt;a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-rsc"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlining the news.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eX0LUU"&gt;“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meta’s AI supercomputer is due to be complete by mid-2022. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ov1Fvm"&gt;Work on RSC began a year and a half ago, with Meta’s engineers designing the machine’s various systems — cooling, power, networking, and cabling — entirely from scratch. Phase one of RSC is already up and running and consists of 760 Nvidia GGX A100 systems containing 6,080 connected GPUs (a type of processor that’s particularly good at tackling machine learning problems). Meta says it’s already providing up to 20 times improved performance on its standard machine vision research tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXtHuo"&gt;Before the end of 2022, though, phase two of RSC will be complete. At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BoVox"&gt;These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReRvQH"&gt;The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oOh1FR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI supercomputers and regular supercomputers can’t necessarily be compared apples to apples&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qONUmH"&gt;The brief explanation is that machine learning requires less accuracy than the tasks put to traditional supercomputers, and so “AI supercomputers” (a bit of recent branding) can carry out more calculations per second than their regular brethren using the same hardware. That means when Meta says it’s built the “world’s fastest &lt;em&gt;AI&lt;/em&gt; supercomputer,” it’s not necessarily a direct comparison to the supercomputers you often see in the news (rankings of which are compiled by the independent &lt;a href="http://Top500.org"&gt;Top500.org&lt;/a&gt; and published twice a year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maU7Ic"&gt;To explain this a little more, you need to know that both supercomputers and AI supercomputers make calculations using what is known as floating-point arithmetic — a mathematical shorthand that’s extremely useful for making calculations using very large and very small numbers (the “floating point” in question is the decimal point, which “floats” between significant figures). The degree of accuracy deployed in floating-point calculations can be adjusted based on different formats, and the speed of most supercomputers is calculated using what are known as 64-bit floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs. However, because AI calculations require less accuracy, AI supercomputers are often measured in 32-bit or even 16-bit FLOPs. That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqCDdJ"&gt;Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eCHLi"&gt;In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reportedly suspends reservations of its Maverick hybrid pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LnojzGmBTlAGSai5AtsOz17NGhU=/705x0:5573x3245/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425990/Ford_Maverick_2L_EcoBoost_AWD_Lariat_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVqMIb"&gt;Ford’s hot-in-demand 2022 Maverick pickup truck appears to be sold out, with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-shuts-off-orders-for-new-20-000-maverick-pickup-11643033093?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the automaker has taken the unusual step of suspending reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnGSlX"&gt;Ford reached out to its dealers to tell them it was suspending customer orders, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports. The company will resume taking orders for the plug-in hybrid truck this summer. A Ford executive confirmed the unusual move in an interview with the paper as well, stating: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sgw4Rs"&gt;“We didn’t want to take more orders than we could build,” said Dean Stoneley, general manager of Ford trucks, in an interview. “We’re getting customers who would have perhaps bought a used car and are now buying the Maverick because it is so affordable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8MCP68"&gt;“There’s been overwhelming demand for Maverick – both hybrid and EcoBoost,” a Ford spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re making the decision to stop taking new retail orders on the 2022 Ford Maverick starting after January 27 to focus on existing orders. Customers may still be able to purchase a Maverick on the lot at their local Ford dealer. We’ll kick off ordering for the 2023 Maverick starting in the summer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03mXeP"&gt;The Maverick’s affordability — the base model starts at $20,000 — as well as its gas-electric hybrid powertrain have made the truck highly desirable for American car buyers who are hungry for cheaper, more environmentally friendly vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6H3JU"&gt;Car prices for both new and used models are at an all-time high amid soaring demand and tight inventory. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;ongoing microchip shortage&lt;/a&gt; is also helping to fuel shortages on dealership lots, further constraining buyer options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcG0Fl"&gt;The average transaction price for a new car is now higher than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price: $45,872 versus $45,209, according to the most recent data from Edmunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGEYlJ"&gt;Big trucks and SUVs, which are the biggest sellers in the US, are helping to drive that average price up. Automakers have responded by also slashing many entry-level vehicles from their lineup, including low-cost sedans and smaller SUVs and crossovers. The Maverick was an outlier: a highly affordable compact truck marketed to younger buyers and urban dwellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ysn456"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Epnrb3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is finally a real wooden boy in first teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Director Guillermo del Toro and a model of his new take on Pinocchio." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y5xdDLHW_WVsDoSRJeow1hCDdxU=/671x361:2930x1867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425824/GDTPinocchioPortrait.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwDwlH"&gt;After years of being trapped in different circles of development hell, co-director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677646/nightmare-alley-guillermo-del-toro-teaser-noir"&gt;Guillermo del Toro’&lt;/a&gt;s long-awaited take on &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;is finally happening, and the stop-motion feature’s first teaser trailer is here to introduce the world to the story’s minuscule moral center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChzW0v"&gt;Set during Benito Mussolini’s fascist reign over Italy in the 1930s, del Toro’s &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;once again tells the tale of a wooden puppet who suddenly comes to life, much to his woodcarver “father’s” surprise. Unlike some of the other &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;tellings you may be familiar with, though, this film’s Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) quickly gets into the sorts of cruel mischief that put him at odds with Geppetto (David Bradley), who loves his son but can’t help but see that he isn’t exactly what one would call a “nice” child. Though this &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;presumes you’re probably familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167323/disney-live-action-adaptations-plus-streaming-pinocchio-peter-pan-wendy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; parts of this fairytale&lt;/a&gt; as a whole, Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor) makes clear in the teaser trailer that there’s more to be said, and he plans to be the one to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="juLqT1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yo02mwsWbAI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTukbW"&gt;Short as the teaser is, it’s got just enough detail to give you a sense of how &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/em&gt;’s more enchanting, playful moments might feel and sound. But what’s still not quite clear is how the film will dance between its fairytale elements and the dark real-world history woven into the narrative. &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;is co-directed by Mark Gustafson and written by del Toro and Patrick McHale. The film also stars David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Christoph Waltz, Finn Wolfhard, Cate Blanchett, John Turturro, Ron Perlman, Tim Blake Nelson, and Burn Gorman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3K6iI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit Netflix sometime this December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google sued by DC and three states for ‘deceptive’ Android location tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kQ1_-NJyQ7dkqZGCJ3IG6XmCA0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425814/acastro_181130_1777_google_bias_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVZNdX"&gt;The attorneys general of three states and the District of Columbia are &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191075/DCv.Google_1_24_22_.pdf"&gt;suing Google&lt;/a&gt; for the allegedly deceptive collection of location data on Android. The complaints, which build on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272625/arizona-ag-sues-google-location-tracking-android-allegations"&gt;a 2020 lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by the Arizona Attorney General, allege that Google’s “complex web” of settings obfuscated whether users were sharing their location at a given moment. Furthermore, they allege Google pushed Android users with “repeated nudging, misleading pressure tactics, and evasive and deceptive descriptions” to share more information either “inadvertently or out of frustration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li42HM"&gt;“Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,” said DC Attorney General Karl Racine in a statement. “The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oY1o1"&gt;Racine’s suit, filed today, accuses Google of violating DC’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act. State attorneys general from Washington, Texas, and Indiana are also filing similar suits in their own jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vokGOu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/DCv.Google%281-24-22%29.pdf"&gt;The DC complaint&lt;/a&gt; claims that Google’s settings “purport to give consumers control over the location data Google collects and uses. But Google’s misleading, ambiguous, and incomplete descriptions of these settings all but guarantee that consumers will not understand when their location is collected and retained by Google or for what purposes.” Like the earlier lawsuit from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, the DC suit draws heavily on &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb"&gt;a 2018 &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that found “many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you’ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaulnv"&gt;Reached for comment, Google denied the claims in the suit, pointing to recent changes like the ability to auto-delete location history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdDUKW"&gt;“The attorneys general are bringing a case based on inaccurate claims and outdated assertions about our settings,” said Google policy spokesperson José Castañeda. “We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mrv2R9"&gt;An Arizona judge, meanwhile, dealt a blow to the Arizona lawsuit last week by &lt;a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/01/26/judge-denies-ags-demand-for-summary-judgment-in-google-fraud-case/"&gt;denying a request&lt;/a&gt; for summary judgment, saying there wasn’t strong enough evidence that Google had actually misled consumers. The judge recommended the case move forward with a jury trial to resolve “a myriad of factual issues,” a path that Brnovich indicated he will pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
