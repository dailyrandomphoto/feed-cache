    <title>Canada plans to start letting vaccinated US travelers back into the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trudeau Gets Leeway From Voters On Slower U.S. Border Reopening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0seGkOuO0HusF4hwIwCAbTIXKwI=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607338/1233137677.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="39lKlv"&gt;Starting on August 9th, Canada is planning on opening its borders to vaccinated Americans after the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185034/us-canada-border-closed-coronavirus-non-essential-traffic"&gt;stopped allowing nonessential travel&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020 (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/19/canada-us-border-open/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2021/07/easing-border-measures-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada---permitting-discretionary-travel-for-citizens-and-permanent-residents-of-th.html"&gt;Canadian government’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the new travel rules will apply to US citizens and permanent residents who are currently living in the country and who have been fully vaccinated with &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines.html"&gt;one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, as well as unvaccinated children who are traveling with a vaccinated guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcXldo"&gt;The announcement does say that the change will only happen if conditions in the country are still good — meaning that if Canada sees a spike in cases between now and August 9th, the border reopening may be reconsidered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3m4tDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It won’t be as easy as showing up to the border with your vaccine card and passport&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="He6OG5"&gt;It’s also clear that, while nonessential travel will be allowed, it won’t be as easy as showing up to the border or airport with your vaccine card and passport. The Public Health Agency of Canada says that travelers will have to fill out a questionnaire using the ArriveCAN app, and that they’ll have to have a “suitable quarantine plan” that they’re prepared to carry out if they don’t meet the requirements for quarantine exemption. &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2021/07/easing-border-measures-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada---permitting-discretionary-travel-for-citizens-and-permanent-residents-of-th.html"&gt;The post&lt;/a&gt; goes more into the exact requirements and criteria, along with other policy changes that will be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDbjUj"&gt;For Americans who have missed visiting their northern neighbors, it seems like trips may be a possibility again soon for those who have gotten the jab. But while preparation and planning were a very good idea for international travel before the pandemic, the additional requirements and documentation submissions make it essential for those who don’t want to be turned away at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos appreciates your efforts to get Jeff Bezos to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0CQHNJb0iZxrxXTPbBpaJmg700=/81x0:837x504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607249/jeff_emerges.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9HQRA"&gt;After landing from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;his little jaunt to the edge of space&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos thanked the people who let him do it. “I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this,“ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahULmV"&gt;No, really, he said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3f0KgN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this is somehow a real quote&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeff Bezos: "I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this ... thank you from the bottom of my heart very much."&lt;a href="https://t.co/5JREV6Uha7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5JREV6Uha7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matthew Champion (@matthewchampion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthewchampion/status/1417514573582716932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2KS83"&gt;Going to space had been a dream for Bezos since at least high school; his valedictory speech included discussion of creating permanent human colonies aboard space stations, according to Brad Stone’s &lt;em&gt;The Everything Store.&lt;/em&gt; His high school girlfriend is also quoted in the book: “The reason he’s earning so much money is to get to outer space.” In some sense, Amazon was a means to an end for Bezos. Blue Origin, founded in 2002, was always the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFrWQg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The reason he’s earning so much money is to get to outer space.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V0jpRQ"&gt;Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 after leaving DE Shaw, an investment firm; Amazon initially operated out of his house. The store began by selling books, but over time expanded to, well, just about everything. The company’s first profit came in 2001, during the dot-com bust. He is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264856/jeff-bezos-worth-amazon-founder-ceo-193-billion-dollars"&gt;one of the richest men&lt;/a&gt; — and sometimes &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; richest man — in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqnsrp"&gt;Bezos is known as an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-10/jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon-excerpt-from-the-everything-store-by-brad-stone#p2?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;especially abrasive leader&lt;/a&gt;, giving feedback such as “Are you lazy or incompetent?” “If I hear that idea again, I’m gonna have to kill myself,” and “Why are you wasting my life?” He was, by all accounts, particularly focused on the customer experience at Amazon, and hyper-competitive. When he stepped down as CEO earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; — formerly the head of Amazon Web Services — took over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s Mobileye begins testing autonomous vehicles in New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--Iyixj3yVZeSi8IiZHXErYGrHs=/129x0:1520x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607138/mobileye_av_nyc_intel_24.jpg.rendition.intel.web.1648.927.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fqi0bk"&gt;Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, is now testing its AVs in New York City — a difficult and rare move given the state’s restrictions around such testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRk8eE"&gt;The announcement was made by Amnon Shashua, president and CEO of the Intel-owned company, at an event in the city on Tuesday. Shashua said the company is currently testing two autonomous vehicles in New York City, but plans to increase that number to seven “in the next few months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ahW57"&gt;New York City has some of &lt;a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/06/30/new-york-city-worst-traffic-in-the-country/"&gt;the most dangerous, congested, and poorly managed streets&lt;/a&gt; in the world. They are also chock-full of construction workers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and double- and sometimes even triple-parked cars. In theory, this would make it very difficult for an autonomous vehicle to navigate, given that AVs typically rely on good weather, clear signage, and less aggressive driving from other road users for safe operation. But Shashua said this was part of the challenge in deciding where to test Mobileye’s vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p486Y"&gt;“I think for a human it’s very, very challenging to drive in New York City,” Shashua said, “not to mention for a robotic car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8k6r18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think for a human it’s very, very challenging to drive in New York City”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqMaTA"&gt;While other states have become hot beds for AV testing, New York has been a bit of a ghost town. Part of the reason could be the state’s strict rules, which include mandating that safety drivers keep their hands on the wheel at all times and requiring state police escort at all times to be paid for by the testing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlFzwc"&gt;A spokesperson for Mobileye says the company has obtained a permit from the state to test its vehicles on public roads and is currently the only AV testing permit holder in the state. The spokesperson also said that police escorts were no longer required. (A spokesperson for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo deferred comment to the state’s Department of of Motor Vehicles, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XxbLIf"&gt;
&lt;div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/576970433?badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Mobileye Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvers through New York City"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEoOvV"&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16488330/gm-cruise-nyc-self-driving-car-test-cuomo"&gt;GM-backed Cruise announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to test its self-driving vehicles in lower Manhattan, but &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/gms-plan-to-test-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-city-seems-1828945330"&gt;those plans were scuttled&lt;/a&gt; with little explanation as to why. Boston-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20755163/new-york-city-self-driving-shuttle-service"&gt;Optimus Ride tested autonomous shuttles in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, but only on private roads as part of the borough’s Navy Yard. Meanwhile, operators flocked to places with friendlier regulations (like Arizona) or ones that are more convenient to their headquarters (like California).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKb4N4"&gt;Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system relies on two subsystems, Shashua said: one that relies on 12 cameras and no other sensors, and another that includes lidar and radar, but no cameras. The company will combine the two subsystems later this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6LRuR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055450/mobileye-self-driving-car-watch-camera-only-intel-jerusalem"&gt;The camera-only system&lt;/a&gt; will go into production as a Level 2 advanced driver assist system on Zeekr, which is a new electric vehicle brand from China’s Geely. This will allow Mobileye to gather more data from consumer-owned vehicles, which it will then use to bolster its fleet of autonomous cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5r3L9I"&gt;Mobileye’s system also includes two of the Israeli company’s latest EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13791848/delphi-mobileye-self-driving-car-pittsburgh-intel-maps"&gt;data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management&lt;/a&gt;, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ90MT"&gt;The company is testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055450/mobileye-self-driving-car-watch-camera-only-intel-jerusalem"&gt;autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities&lt;/a&gt; around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well. Earlier this year, Mobileye said it would launch a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023"&gt;full-scale, fully driverless delivery vehicle service&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome for Android will make it easier to manage sites’ permissions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gZPxLQcMeFPCp6ITURFBu2WXTKQ=/0x105:1558x1144/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607035/Screen_Shot_2021_07_20_at_9.48.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="edXAzU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-and-performance-working-together-chrome/"&gt;Google is updating&lt;/a&gt; Chrome for Android’s permissions controls to make per-site permissions easier to access and manage. The update, available to Chrome on Android users, makes it faster to change what information a site can and cannot access. Tapping the lock button, then tapping Permissions will show a list of what the site is allowed to access, along with toggles to enable or disable them as you want. Google also says that there’s an upcoming feature that will let you “forget” the site from your browsing history, which is in the same vein as its recent feature allowing you to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578981/google-search-history-quick-delete-15-minutes"&gt;wipe the record of your last 15 minutes of browsing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of the updated permissions controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M2DHuU"&gt;Google is also introducing some new privacy and security-centric Chrome Actions, which are commands you can type into the address bar. For example, typing “delete history” will get you a button to delete your history. Today, Google is adding a “safety check” action that will let you quickly run a scan of your passwords, extensions, and more, as well as actions to let you manage security settings or manage sync. These actions should be available on Chrome for desktop starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiX2CEPA6Q-fah30P8hatmCtxrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728648/Screen_Shot_2021_07_20_at_9.31.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Chrome Action for managing passwords using the browser’s built-in tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ahZ1S7"&gt;Google’s blog also mentions a more under-the-hood security update, which will expand Google’s Site Isolation and improves phishing detection’s performance. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s latest preview introduces first Teams integration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/th68NA63m4jf3l116MFLmbQXSTc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607031/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InFnXD"&gt;When Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June, it revealed that Microsoft Teams would be integrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;directly into the operating system&lt;/a&gt; and that you’d be able to connect with other people via a new Chat window. The first preview for the new operating system didn’t have that new functionality, but Microsoft is starting to roll it out in a limited way starting Tuesday with the newest Windows 11 preview for Windows Insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvNZNo"&gt;The rollout of all of the promised features will happen over time, Microsoft’s Brandon LeBlanc said in a blog post. “In this first stage, you’ll be able to sign in, add contacts, and connect via individual and group chats,” he said. “Over the coming weeks, we will enable audio and video calling, meetings, screen sharing and other capabilities.” He also noted that Chat will roll out first to a “subset” of Insiders. To get started, click the Chat icon on the taskbar and sign in with your Microsoft account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCARYp"&gt;Windows 11 brings a whole new design, a centered Start menu, the ability to run Android apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;hinted at an October release date&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade is getting a musical take on Tetris</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQsuZMGq-HfPbwuAWDVHsnIkPw4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606781/TetrisBeat_Screenshots_4.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QHmLqz"&gt;Apple Arcade’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;recent expansion&lt;/a&gt; means that the subscription service is now home to plenty of classic games — and things don’t get much more classic than T&lt;em&gt;etris&lt;/em&gt;. Today, Apple announced that &lt;em&gt;Tetris Beat&lt;/em&gt;, which mashes up the classic block-dropping puzzler with a rhythm game featuring music from the likes of Alison Wonderland, is coming to Arcade “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh3SRo"&gt;There’s no word on a specific release date, but &lt;em&gt;Beat&lt;/em&gt; features 18 exclusive songs, split-screen support if you’re on an Apple TV, and spatial audio for those listening with AirPods. It looks to be yet another inventive take on the game, following the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224853/tetris-99-battle-royale-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;the battle royale &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"&gt;Tetsuya Mizuguchi’s meditative &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8tEAy"&gt;The news is also part of a solid run for Apple Arcade. Last week saw the debut of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22568867/altos-odyssey-the-lost-city-apple-arcade-trailer-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alto’s Odyssey: The Lost City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while this Friday will include a huge Tokyo expansion for &lt;em&gt;Skate City&lt;/em&gt;, along with mobile classics &lt;em&gt;Jetpack Joyride&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/1/10699976/neko-atsume-the-game-of-passivity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neko Atsume&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Also listed as coming soon is the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-like &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories&lt;/em&gt; (which coincidentally &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22568610/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-ruin-killing-monsties-guilty-conscience"&gt;just received a sequel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new premium Chromebooks are now available starting at $749.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two models of the Asus Chromebook CX9 sit perpendicular to each other. The one facing the camera displays a birds-eye view of a shoreline." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gHk2uq1ZfB235PZnurrjedg1Iz4=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606749/Chromebook_CX9_CX9400_premium_enterprise_resady_Security_titan_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AK9tul"&gt;There are a number of excellent Chromebooks out there, but the race to make the one true successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google’s $999 Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt; is still very much on. Asus is throwing its hat into the ring with two new releases: the Chromebook CX9 and the Chromebook Flip CX5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wi5ZHT"&gt;Both new Chromebooks meet US MIL-STD 810H standards, the company says, meaning they’ve undergone various tests for pressure, shock, drop, and more. Both can also be configured with up to an Intel Core i7 processor with Iris Xe graphics (which will be overkill for all but the most particular of users). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoq2Wa"&gt;The clamshell Chromebook CX9 comes with up to 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a 550-nit UHD touchscreen. (There are FHD touch and non-touch options as well). Asus claims 14 hours of battery life (using a video playback test). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="F8vgSc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Best Chromebook 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="39vbbQ"&gt;The CX9 is also the first Chromebook to feature Asus’ NumberPad, an LED num pad that appears on the touchpad when you tap an icon in the top corner. This technology has been handy on previous Asus laptops — it appears on the company’s popular ZenBook line, including the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 13&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8Jupa"&gt;The convertible Chromebook Flip CX5 is more standard fare. It offers up to 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM, though the screen is limited to a 1080p touch panel. A USI stylus is included, which Asus claims will get 45 minutes of use from 15 seconds of charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPhmlr"&gt;The Asus Chromebook CX9 is available now on Asus’ store — a model with a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202107AM140000004"&gt;Core i3, 128GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt; will cost $749.99, and a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202107AM140000008"&gt;Core i7 with 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt; is $1,149.99. The Chromebook Flip CX5 is $1,049.99, though we haven’t yet been able to find it on the Asus store. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube adds a new way to tip creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="YouTube on mobile phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vd6uy7DLHeoJcwz1fNyW4F7BrE4=/0x127:2040x1487/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606616/cfaulkner_200527_4039_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3g4wy"&gt;YouTube viewers will soon have a new way to throw their support — and money — behind their favorite creators. A new tool called Super Thanks that lets you tip creators is now being tested on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSKw4X"&gt;The feature lets users applaud a creator by choosing from one of four price points between $2 and $50 (or the regional currency equivalent). When a user purchases one of these four options, they’ll see a celebratory animation on-screen and a colorful comment with their name appear below the video in the comments section. Creators themselves will be able to respond to these messages in the same way they can on regular comments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-FptiPdSyL3YFwlT0EhlqwwVhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727227/blogPixelFinalgif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new Super Thanks feature shown on a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XciY3J"&gt;YouTube has been testing the tool under a separate name, Viewer Applause, over the past year. Now named Super Thanks, it’s available in beta in 68 countries on desktop, Android, and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyZwrw"&gt;Super Thanks is the fourth option YouTube has added for directly paying creators. The platform also offers channel memberships, which let creators offer monthly subscriptions. Then there’s Super Stickers and Super Chat, which let viewers leave tips in chat during livestreams. But where Super Stickers and Chat work on live feeds, Super Thanks can be used across all eligible uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrajtV"&gt;While the feature is launching with four set payment amounts from which to choose, the ability to manually input other dollar amounts is “definitely something that we would be interested in looking to add in,” Barbara Macdonald, a product manager of paid digital goods at YouTube, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. During its earlier testing phase, there had originally only been one price point, but creators told the company that viewers wanted more choice when showing their support for a channel they enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKeKbt"&gt;YouTube pays eligible creators a cut of the ad revenue that runs in front of their videos. But that income stream isn’t always reliable, and it has shrunk considerably at times when advertisers have pulled back from YouTube during controversies. Giving creators options to get paid directly from viewers offers a possible backup revenue stream so they aren’t entirely reliant on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3FSos"&gt;Creators must be part of the YouTube Partner Program to receive access to Super Thanks. The beta launch will be a “randomized rollout,” Macdonald said, before coming to all Partner Program members later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter shares a first look at the ‘big overhaul’ coming to TweetDeck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tweetdeck redesign preview" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGn5WADif4WawPEOVguREkED0fM=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606591/E6v2Gn7WQAEqJmS.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tweetdeck redesign preview | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7egTd8"&gt;Kayvon Beykpour &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321991/twitter-tweetdeck-overhaul-redesign-product-changes"&gt;said in a March interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter does know TweetDeck still exists and the company is working on an overhaul “from the ground up.” Today, Twitter posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499557055827985"&gt;a single image of the reworked app&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that it represents a preview going into testing with a few “randomly-selected” people from the US, Canada, and Australia. If you can’t wait to see it yourself, Jane Manchun Wong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1417520652634836992"&gt;explains how you can opt in to the test right now&lt;/a&gt; with a simple browser tweak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6S2siu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re testing this preview with a small group of randomly-selected people in the United States, Canada, and Australia to start. If you’re eligible, you’ll see an invitation within TweetDeck to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;— TweetDeck (@TweetDeck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499557055827985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="EvPech"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter is reinventing itself","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XdkNME"&gt;TweetDeck powers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s newsroom, and many others, so any changes are likely to meet a skeptical audience of power users, but so far it’s tough to find the improvements. The app’s appeal is in its column views that haven’t changed much over the last decade, but the layout in the screenshot looks very different from what we’re used to, and in the left column a button promotes decks to sort various content types. Otherwise, it looks a lot more like the standard Twitter view, which isn’t why I use TweetDeck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3Curg"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501900409171971"&gt;a tweet today&lt;/a&gt;, Beykpour said that new features in testing for TweetDeck “include a full Tweet Composer, new advanced search features, new column types, and a new way to group columns into clean workspaces.” Twitter may have more reasons to hope the upgrades are a hit — rumors have said the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272364/twitter-premium-subscriptions-tweetdeck-undo-send-tipping-ads"&gt;considering charging for it in the future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qg8zRU"&gt;To try out the “new TweetDeck,” just follow Jane’s instructions. Open TweetDeck in your browser, then go to Developer Tools (if you’re using Chrome), open the console tab, copy the HTML below, paste, then hit enter and reload the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z5E9o8"&gt;document.cookie = "tweetdeck_version=beta" &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="U89ofB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We'll take these lessons into account as we explore what TweetDeck could look like within Twitter's subscription offerings later on. We'll have more to share soon as we learn from these tests.&lt;/p&gt;— Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501902149881856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uvh8tS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 20th, 12:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added details on how to try the preview version now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to reply to your video comments on TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fD6YnWx1NZLtNZHB8WVGCZSrS6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69606151/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X7jrog"&gt;If you’re a video creator on TikTok, then your comment section could be really frustrating, especially if somebody leaves a comment that completely misinterprets what you’ve been saying (to say the least). You could send a text reply or simply create another video, but according to TikTok, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video"&gt;now you have a third option&lt;/a&gt;: you can reply to your comments using video rather than text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nknc1w"&gt;(Note: since this is something specifically for creators who want to video-reply to comments, we haven’t been able to test it yet. If / when we do, we’ll let you know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkph2Z"&gt;To add a video to a comment on one of your existing TikTok videos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1LM3kU"&gt;Tap on the comment you want to reply to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BLop4W"&gt;If you have the ability to reply using a video, you’ll see an icon of a video camera on the left side of the field. Tap that icon. You can also press and hold the comment you want to reply to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6qMA0N"&gt;Record your video as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LoOBp0"&gt;If you wish, you can have the comment that your video is replying to attached to that video. This will allow anyone who views your video separately to see what you’re responding to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QCm7Ot"&gt;Post the video as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I8aPCd"&gt;Your video will be available both in the comments section (of the video you’ve commented on) and on your own page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QFs7Ag"&gt;Got it? If not, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6935521116114914566?sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6880557340434466310&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=0"&gt;TikTok has a video&lt;/a&gt; showing how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWpKbr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6824578676303154438" data-video-id="6824578676303154438" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want to reply to a comment with a video? Now you can! Available now for all users!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6824578672654256902"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
