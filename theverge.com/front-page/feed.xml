    <title>Microsoft teases new Windows 11 startup sound with 11-minute video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/el5QcgYKIM2mORZYH5G53Qar9m0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434932/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uchFNS"&gt;Microsoft is back teasing Windows 11 again. In a new video on YouTube, the software giant has published an 11-minute (&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;) collection of startup sounds from various versions of Windows. They’re all slowed down by 4,000 percent, and Microsoft positions this as a relaxing video for those far too excited by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"&gt;the Windows event on June 24th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zC0PR7"&gt;“Having trouble relaxing because you’re too excited for the June 24th Microsoft Event?” asks the YouTube caption. “Take a slow trip down memory lane with the Windows 95, XP, and 7 startup sounds slowed down to a meditative 4,000 percent reduced speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZGyhX"&gt;I think this is very much teasing a new startup sound for Windows 11, or whatever the next version of Windows will be called. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;Microsoft has been teasing “a new version of Windows” recently&lt;/a&gt;, and has dropped a number of hints that it could in fact be called Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnZgG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft to reveal its next generation of Windows on June 24th ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"},{"title":"Microsoft looks ready to launch Windows 11 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HZtkXS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft loves the number 11 right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRcYbt"&gt;Among those hints is the event starting at 11AM ET and the event invite that has a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks very much like the number 11. Microsoft execs have been teasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;“next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt; for months, and it’s clear from this latest video that these 11 teasers will continue in the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8X0LrH"&gt;We’re expecting Microsoft to announce a new version of Windows with significant user interface changes. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed “Sun Valley,” which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.” There will be many other changes, including some significant Windows Store ones, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;read our previous coverage for what to expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqyX5v"&gt;We’ll find out on June 24th whether Microsoft is ready to dial the version number of Windows up to 11, simply name it Windows Sun Valley, or something else entirely. The Windows elevent (as we’re now calling it) will start at 11AM ET on June 24th, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA got hit by a data breach, and hackers are selling source code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NtF_CTcSxYraHNR6f8p1cF0iLmA=/317x0:3557x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434821/RevealScreenshot_15_VistaBorderline_3840x2160_NoLogo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Battlefield 2042 is powered by the Frostbite engine&lt;/em&gt;. | Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RJntyK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5xpx/hackers-steal-data-electronic-arts-ea-fifa-source-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that EA has fallen victim to hackers, who made away with the source code to &lt;em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;/em&gt;, the Frostbite engine (which is behind not only &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/frostbite/games"&gt;EA’s soccer/football series&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;Battlefield as well&lt;/a&gt;), and other game development tools. The hackers are reportedly advertising that the data is for sale on hacking forums, but that they’ll only consider offers from big-name members of the hacking community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyMogg"&gt;Source code is a big deal in programing, so it’s a big deal when companies lose control over it, and the gaming industry has seen some huge thefts recently: hackers stole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276664/cyberpunk-witcher-hackers-auction-source-code-ransomware-attack"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s&lt;/a&gt; source code for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3 &lt;/em&gt;in February and in July of 2020, Nintendo saw the source code for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/26/21339018/nintendo-gigaleak-super-mario-64-zelda-pokemon-what-is-it-snes"&gt;many SNES and Nintendo 64 games&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; and an unreleased Zelda game, released into the wild in what’s been dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/26/21339018/nintendo-gigaleak-super-mario-64-zelda-pokemon-what-is-it-snes"&gt;the “Nintendo Gigaleak.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu2BI2"&gt;While it’s unlikely that other reputable developers would use EA’s code on purpose, hackers being able to see the inner workings of a game or engine could &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2460240/hacker-group-targets-video-game-companies-to-steal-source-code.html"&gt;help them craft cheats&lt;/a&gt; or cracks — it could also reveal secret projects and game ideas, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/26/5549208/microsoft-early-code-contains-hidden-jokes"&gt;developer comments&lt;/a&gt; that companies would rather not see the light of day. Breaches also aren’t terribly great for a company’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WQd4M"&gt;In addition to EA’s own proprietary code and tools, the hackers claim they have Microsoft Xbox and Sony’s SDKs and API keys available for sale as well. Here’s a screenshot &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-breach-gaming-giant-electronic-arts-steal-game-source-code/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that claims hackers have a total of 780GB worth of stolen data:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPT_C4NvhkUeWU81ZtWUV__sDhE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650602/EA_data_theft.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft and Sony tools may also be for sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rQJB3x"&gt;An EA spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that hackers stole “a limited amount of game source code and related tools,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and said that the hackers didn’t have access to player data. They also said that the company had improved its security following the hack, and doesn’t expect an impact on its games or business. EA was clear to us that, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437730/colonial-pipeline-normal-ransomware-attack-fuel"&gt;recent string&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;of cybersecurity incidents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;we’ve seen&lt;/a&gt;, this was not a ransomware attack, and that it’s working with law enforcement to investigate the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix just announced a huge slate of anime series and films</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naVyKbul4UyioOnDRztoEt3Vy8E=/0x26:1280x879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434657/GSP_Gdesign_yamamori_1007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ifyvio"&gt;Netflix’s expansion into anime continues. Today, the streaming service announced details for a number of exciting shows, ranging from a horror series with characters designed by &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;’s Yoshitaka Amano to the next chapter in the &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; franchise to another Godzilla show. Here’s everything that was announced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jg4ctj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="ODePBY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MzxnPP5TLeU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0MdKr"&gt;The headliner was the return of classic mech franchise &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt;, with a series called &lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;. “After Char’s rebellion, Hathaway Noa leads an insurgency against Earth Federation, but meeting an enemy officer and a mysterious woman alters his fate,” the description reads. It’s listed as coming soon and will eventually be joined by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380140/netflix-live-action-gundam-movie-jordan-vogt-roberts-legendary-sunrise"&gt;a live-action &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt; from director Jordan Vogt-Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="frKEoQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shaman King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="EI1yEV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3ymwr_MJ2Y?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mOSW3O"&gt;August 9th will see the debut of &lt;em&gt;Shaman King&lt;/em&gt;, a show about shamans fighting each other to become king. It’s a simple enough premise that looks to be buoyed by plenty of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZMESF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edens Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="uW6XfJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0T5TwEB7xo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BDL8dR"&gt;Sci-fi manga &lt;em&gt;Edens Zero&lt;/em&gt; is becoming an anime, with an impressive-looking series about a boy who can control gravity. It’ll come out on August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5tv5hr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="YgjGA1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's your first glimpse at Exception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new space horror anime series is based on a new story by Hirotaka Adachi (aka "Otsuichi"), with character designs by Final Fantasy's Yoshitaka Amano. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7CWhmNu9O6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7CWhmNu9O6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403023872312549391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe7qVi"&gt;We don’t have a trailer for the horror series &lt;em&gt;Exception&lt;/em&gt;, but this one piece of teaser art is creepy enough on its own. Perhaps the most exciting part is that it will feature character designs from famed &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; artist Yoshitaka Amano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qvrAFB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bright: Samurai Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="yeUzIj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Announcing Bright: Samurai Soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Izo, a Ronin, and Raiden, an orc, work to bring a young elf girl and the wand she carries to the land of the elves in the north. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the Netflix movie, the anime film will be directed by Kyohei Ishiguro. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/K03gZVMUie"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K03gZVMUie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403024398848724994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3OP7i"&gt;There’s no trailer for this one either, but the first image shows off a beautiful art style that I can’t wait to see in motion. No word on a premiere date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RK7qNq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make My Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ig53zN"&gt;On the film front, Netflix also announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403024167625129989"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make My Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which sounds like it will channel frozen horror classics like &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt;: “On a cold planet of ice and snow, mysterious creatures suddenly have appeared from the dark underground and have begun to attack the inhabitants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nHmnHX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla: Singular Point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="2F5aNG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you see Rodan - run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Godzilla: Singular Point is available globally June 24th. Here's your first look at the English dub. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3wi6M4sslo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3wi6M4sslo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403025037980880898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AaO953"&gt;This kaiju series debuted on Netflix in Japan earlier in the year, but it’ll be available globally — and in English — on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will shut down at the end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H5XaFSmRqA3ewzz7I7q36VS-jdo=/8x0:877x579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434413/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_8.45.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Sky on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBnzIy"&gt;Following Apple’s acquisition of popular weather app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Dark Sky in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will be available until the end of 2022, co-founder Adam Grossman said in a Monday update to &lt;a href="https://blog.darksky.net/"&gt;Dark Sky’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-apple-acquisition-shutdown-date/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAX1EV"&gt;The update about the 2022 shutdown hit the same day that Apple announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22527878%2Fdark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new weather features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; as part of its WWDC keynote presentation. The stock Weather app is getting a new design, full-screen weather maps, next-hour precipitation notifications, and even new animated backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWhDEQ"&gt;Dark Sky shut down the Android and Wear OS versions of its apps on August 1st, 2020. But the iOS app is still available &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id517329357"&gt;for $3.99 on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in buying it ahead of next year’s shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KBtqm"&gt;The Dark Sky API will also continue to work for existing customers until the end of 2022. Previously, the API was set to stop working at the end of this year; now, it will work for a little while longer.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for Netflix’s Masters of the Universe: Revelation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yxcxsx"&gt;Our first look at Kevin Smith’s revival of He-Man is here: today, Netflix debuted the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/em&gt;, which will hit the streaming service on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78wlPi"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&lt;/em&gt;, which also streamed on Netflix, the new He-Man series isn’t a reboot of the classic cartoon. Instead, it’s a continuation, which picks up right after the original show ended in 1985, with the excellent addition of Mark Hamill as Skeletor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVmMrT"&gt;Here’s how Smith, who is serving as showrunner, describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rGBP7A"&gt;Narratively our show is set up as the next episode in the legacy ‘80s animated series that aired from 1983-1985. This is a continuation of that story. We’re playing with the original mythology and characters, and revisiting and digging deeper into some of the unresolved storylines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te5HDz"&gt;Visually we also made the conscious decision to lean into the &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; line of toys for inspiration as well. Mattel owns this entire vast library of that artwork, so right away we wanted the show to open with classic pieces of that artwork. Mattel has been committed to this look since they first started as a toy line in the ‘80s, and now we’re leaning into it and honoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UdhDjZ"&gt;The news was announced as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;the first week-long Netflix Geeked event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the debut of Tesla Model S Plaid, the ‘quickest production car ever made’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2_KM0ClvWDR4bb5AHy3cVWYwww=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434160/0x0_ModelS_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X8n8t"&gt;Tesla will hold a delivery event for its new, high-performance “Plaid” version of the Model S on Thursday. It’s an effort by Elon Musk’s company to reignite interest in its nearly decade-old electric sedan, which is also facing stiff competition from Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. When its released, Musk claims the Plaid Model S will be the “quickest production car ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVL4lI"&gt;The event, which will be held at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, CA, will be livestreamed for the public starting at 7PM PT / 10PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 8:30PM PT). It was originally scheduled for June 3rd, but Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed it to the 10th&lt;/a&gt; after tweeting that the vehicle needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLuJqJ"&gt;The delivery of the refreshed Model S has also been delayed, with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;originally stating&lt;/a&gt; that it expected to begin shipping to customers in March. A revamped version of the Model X SUV was also expected to begin deliveries in March but has been pushed to an unspecified future date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aIeQOb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Model S Plaid delivery event at our Fremont factory will be streamed live on June 10, 7pm Pacific &lt;a href="https://t.co/V7c77ySFti"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V7c77ySFti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tesla (@Tesla) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1401992031073886212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XW7ms"&gt;The Plaid Model S wasn’t inevitable. Despite persistent rumors for years, Musk seemed uninterested in the idea, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1148443699858292736?lang=en"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that “[t]here is no ‘refreshed’ Model X or Model S coming.” Tesla instead was constantly making minor improvements to both vehicles, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTCANQ"&gt;But less than two months later, a prototype version of the Plaid powertrain made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;debut at the Laguna Seca raceway&lt;/a&gt;, lapping the famous California racetrack in just one minute and 36 seconds. The company later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;showed off another prototype as part of its Battery Day presentation&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020. Plaid, much like the “Ludicrous” acceleration mode in Tesla’s cars, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0"&gt;is a reference to one of Musk’s favorite movies, &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jd6NRG"&gt;We already know most of the relevant specs: an estimated range of 390 miles, a top speed of 200mph (with the “right tires,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354620643967438855?s=20"&gt;Musk has said&lt;/a&gt;), and a 0–60mph sprint in 1.99 seconds (although &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yigpPSu_o"&gt;there’s been some questions&lt;/a&gt; about the validity of that last claim). The new model is priced at $129,990, compared to $79,990 for a long-range Model S. A “Plaid Plus” version of the Model S, which was supposed to have a range of more than 520 miles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22521769/elon-musk-tweets-tesla-plaid-plus-canceled"&gt;was canceled&lt;/a&gt; after Musk tweeted that basic Plaid is “just so good.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWYf1w"&gt;The new Model S will also feature a simplified interior, with a landscape touchscreen similar to what’s found in the Model 3 and Model Y. There’s also a stalkless U-shaped butterfly steering wheel, much like what Tesla has said will appear in the forthcoming second-generation Roadster. And there’s an added screen behind the center console for rear-seat passengers. Unlike the Model 3 and Model Y, the new Model S still features a cockpit screen behind the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7MdCtMS0l1fSySlSruXRLH5HCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650063/0x0_ModelS_14.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENiPhjaouJlz3HrHlYaAgquEPK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650062/0x0_ModelS_13.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MrpUCg"&gt;Tesla says that the Plaid Model S should be able to do five times as many quarter-mile runs as previous Model S sedans, thanks to the new powertrain and the new heat pump that was developed for the Model Y. It will also come with an infotainment system that’s powered by a chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop"&gt;capable of 10 teraflops of processing power&lt;/a&gt;, allowing passengers to play games like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; (with wireless controller support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0Ltyo"&gt;When it first launched in 2012, the Tesla Model S redefined electric luxury, with a sleek design and long driving range. But the company is facing a new wave of competition, with the release in recent years of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-tron GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes EQS&lt;/a&gt;. If Tesla wants to stay in the luxury EV game, it needed to make some changes to its flagship vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yhljhT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Tesla wants to stay in the luxury EV game, it needed to make some changes to its flagship vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxubKn"&gt;The abrupt cancellation of Plaid Plus, however, is raising questions about the automaker’s battery plans. Plaid Plus was supposed to feature Tesla’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;tabless 4680 battery cells&lt;/a&gt;. These cells, which are supposed to enable longer ranges of 500 miles or more, are bigger than the company’s current cells, measuring 46 millimeters by 80 millimeters (thus the name). In addition to more energy and power, the new cells are expected to result in a 14 percent reduction in cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) at the cell form factor level only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks6oa1"&gt;Plaid Plus was supposed to get a range of 520 miles. While Musk could shock everyone Thursday night with a longer range Plaid than originally advertised, he also recently threw cold water on the idea of needing ranges longer than 400 miles. In a &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/06/elon-musk-tesla-canceling-model-s-plaid-need-400-mile-range/"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said “more range doesn’t really matter. There are essentially zero trips above 400 miles where the driver doesn’t need to stop for restroom, food, coffee, etc. anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzIIB"&gt;Ignoring for a moment that most restroom breaks last shorter than the time it takes to recharge an electric vehicle, Musk’s reversal on Plaid Plus could signal a delay in the production of Tesla’s 4680 battery cells. In addition to Plaid, the new cells are supposed to be used in Tesla’s Cybertruck and Semi vehicles, which are still expected later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiDhPp"&gt;In an April earnings call, Musk said that Tesla was still “12... to 18 months away from volume production of 4680.” It remains to be seen whether we’ll get an update on that estimate at the event Thursday evening. But with Musk, you never know for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbDIdsB8AyFH5gNMa9_bSViPs5k=/0x133:1690x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434102/824_2021_06_07_824_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ksqI6"&gt;Apple’s new health features will be available for anyone with an iPhone. But two of the tools announced at WWDC 2021, walking steadiness and the ability to share health data with family members, could be particularly useful for older adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOBiA0"&gt;People who work with older adults are excited that a company like Apple is interested in tech that could be used for this group. Experts have spent years frustrated that companies don’t design products to meet the needs of that demographic. There have been a few attempts to introduce new tools, but none got much traction, says Richard Schulz, a social psychologist studying aging at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXROR"&gt;“I think the reason is that the big boys — companies like Apple — never got into it,” Schulz says. The new features are a signal that the tide is starting to turn. “Apple getting into this is a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EzfAG0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of falling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gUjfyk"&gt;The first feature, the walking steadiness indicator, targets a major issue for older adults: falling. Falls are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/older-adult-falls/index.html"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of accidents, injury, and death for seniors in the US, and they’re responsible for billions in healthcare costs each year. Researchers have been studying falls — and trying to figure out ways to prevent them — for decades, says ‪Jacob Sosnoff‬, who studies mobility in the department of physical therapy and rehabilitation science at the University of Kansas Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GShEH"&gt;“We can do a really good job in the lab measuring walking impairment and making predictions and recommendations, but we’re not very good in the real world,” Sosnoff says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYMN0E"&gt;Apple’s new walking steadiness feature aims to track people as they move through their daily lives. It uses metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground to monitor how stable a user is. It can only be measured on the iPhone, not an Apple Watch, because some of the metrics have to be calculated from as close to the hip as possible, Apple says — so in a pocket or a bag works best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMjGjD"&gt;Apple Watch already has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt; feature that can prompt users to call emergency services or automatically make a call if the user is immobile for around a minute. The new iPhone capability focuses on prediction, rather than response: it can tell people if they’re walking steadily and issue an alert if it thinks they’re at an increased risk of falling. Apple says the system is based on data collected during a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; that included over 100,000 participants of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ljt9QL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Having people be aware of their fall risk is important”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52srye"&gt;There are no major commercial products that track the quality of people’s movement, Sosnoff says. Until now, most movement trackers have focused on how much people moved. “That’s why there’s a lot of excitement about this,” he says. “Having people be aware of their fall risk is important.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMYTXH"&gt;But there’s also a downside to telling people that they might fall — fear of falling is linked to actually experiencing a fall. If alerts increase that fear, people might limit their physical activity or even stop leaving the house as much, says Clara Berridge, a professor at the University of Washington who studies healthcare technology in aging populations. “That will likely contribute to their actual risk of falling, because they’re decreasing their strength and activity,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9EKJ3"&gt;It’s a fine balance, Sosnoff says. “We want people to be aware of the risks but not so overly concerned that they don’t do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeJu5B"&gt;Sosnoff says he’s eager to see if the walking steadiness feature could actually reduce falls in real-world scenarios. One challenge for the tool could be monitoring people whose walking is impaired — like people with a limp, for example. Algorithms that track gait often don’t work as well in those situations, he says. If the Apple feature has that problem, it could flag people with different walking patterns who might not actually be a fall risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMxUFg"&gt;The Apple feature may not be able to help everyone at fall risk. Walking patterns are only one of the many reasons people fall: poor eyesight with age can cause people to trip, certain medications can reduce balance, and items around the house (like loose rugs) can be hazardous. The Apple walking steadiness feature is designed to suggest that people who are at risk of falling do various stability exercises, which can be useful in some cases. But for some people, balance may not be the main problem. “Getting prompted to do exercises isn’t the only solution,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kyioTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rbb8oE"&gt;Getting information on a user’s walk also requires that they carry their phone around regularly. Sosnoff says he’s not sure older adults actually do. Many may use their phones in different ways than younger people. “I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeiGI"&gt;There are advantages, though, to having a player like Apple working on falls. “They’re going to have a significant amount of data to help see what’s going on,” Sosnoff says. If the iPhone could actually prevent falls, it’d be a huge boon. “We put people back together again if they fall and get hurt, but we don’t really do much to stop the fall. It would be exciting if we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="S6B7H1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8YOgpd"&gt;Apple will also now let users share their health data with other people. The feature could be a major convenience for family members and caregivers of older adults, who may want or need to keep track of someone’s health metrics. Currently, they might have to collect information from multiple different sources — a heart rate app, a blood pressure monitor system. The Apple sharing feature could give them direct access in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rpjt7n"&gt;“I could see this being extremely appealing for adult children,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foxb1Z"&gt;It also raises privacy concerns for older adults. The Apple feature is controlled entirely by the user, who gets to decide in the app what information they want shared and with whom. In reality, though, older people who aren’t comfortable with technology may not be able to take charge of that decision themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GukAx"&gt;“It’s very common to have an adult child purchase a phone for an older adult, and set up the settings, and take the phone out of their hand and say, ‘let me just fix it for you,’” Berridge says. “That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAgHDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1hsRR"&gt;Some people might be very comfortable opening up their Health app to family members, but there’s still a power dynamic involved. Older adults tend to like monitoring technology less than their adult children, and say they want to maintain their privacy without feeling watched. But their adult children are confident that they can convince parents to use monitoring technology, even if they say they’re uncomfortable with it, Berridge’s research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102442/"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re not necessarily inclined to engage them in the conversation, they’re just very confident that their preferences would rule at the end of the day,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YORt02"&gt;On the flip side, adult children who use this feature might find themselves inundated with information about their older parents that they’re not sure how to interpret, says social psychologist Schulz. “Decisions have to be made about how that information is parsed and translated for the person who’s getting access,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyIhsr"&gt;In practice, Berridge isn’t sure how useful it would be to have a family member see all of the Health app data. “People may say, okay, what do I do with this information exactly? At what point is it meaningful, when do I call a doctor, and so on. It could be an alert overload situation, too.” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biuqC2"&gt;Despite those concerns, there’s increasing interest in ways to keep older adults healthy at home. The COVID-19 pandemic showed that senior care facilities can be dangerous, and people generally don’t want to live in them, Berridge says. The new features from Apple highlight movement in that direction. “Moving the monitoring out of facilities and into the home is going to be a major trend,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2TrfS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Record labels sue Roblox for letting users upload pirated songs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Holiday’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAuhRRK-KRwMIHArBZjXs4lsm7Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434047/LNX_Concert_HOLIDAY.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tIIML"&gt;The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) has sued &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; for letting users upload music from Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, deadmau5, and other artists without paying a licensing fee. &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912.1.0.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit seeks&lt;/a&gt; $200 million in damages and a court order that will make &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; crack down on piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FHKre"&gt;The NMPA filed suit yesterday on behalf of several major music publishers. It accuses &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;massively popular, kid-focused platform&lt;/a&gt; for games and social experiences — of hosting a shared library of copyrighted but unlicensed songs. The complaint alleges that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively preys on its impressionable user base and their desire for popular music, teaching children that pirating music is perfectly acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KeRkpr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Roblox’ allows a prodigious level of infringing material”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ucvZMc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; offers a library of audio files, 3D models, and other assets for building experiences. Users upload these files themselves, but the NMPA claims &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively encourages” adding popular songs. It also notes that users pay for uploading audio files with in-game currency. “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; allows a prodigious level of infringing material through its gates, purposely turning a blind eye for the sake of profit,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94QiQ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/06/addressing-recently-filed-litigation-certain-music-publishers/"&gt;responded to the complaint&lt;/a&gt; on its website. “We are surprised and disappointed by this lawsuit which represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; platform operates, and will defend &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; vigorously as we work to achieve a fair resolution,” the statement says. It notes that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has partnered with music labels for authorized events &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;like a Lil Nas X concert&lt;/a&gt; last year, and the company &lt;a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/upcoming-music-changes-and-copyright-related-action/130570"&gt;signed a licensing deal&lt;/a&gt; with APM Music in 2018. “We do not tolerate copyright infringement, which is why we use industry-leading, advanced filtering technology to detect and prohibit unauthorized recordings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwvkEJ"&gt;As the complaint notes, searching &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s library for exact names like “Ed Sheeran” or “Ariana Grande” returns no results. But searching for partial terms like “Sheeran” or “Ariana” will pull up tracks labeled with popular songs from both artists. (Not all the labels are accurate — one file titled “Ed Sheeran - The Shape Of You” is actually a sound clip from &lt;em&gt;The Purge, &lt;/em&gt;for instance.) “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s use of filtering technology has been nothing more than an empty gesture to mask its long history of instigating, inducing, and encouraging users, including children, to infringe copyrighted music,” the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UVsbR"&gt;Virtually all big web platforms clash with record labels at some point, and the disputes often end with the companies striking a deal. The NMPA and Google &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/08/music-publishers-youtube-end-spat-061592"&gt;settled a similar lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over YouTube copyright infringement in 2011, leading to the platform’s current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16796058/youtube-universal-music-group-sony-agreement-royalties"&gt;royalty-sharing agreement&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside the news of this lawsuit, the NMPA announced a “major ramp-up” of copyright takedown notices against Twitch — pressuring parent company Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534983/riaa-copyright-twitch-streamers-licensing-letter"&gt;into expanding&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;currently limited licensing deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Control is free on the Epic Games Store for one week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EQ5MA_s-OOH7Bc9HDPyC-wyJ64=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433983/Drifter_combat.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNoH1s"&gt;Remedy’s excellent supernatural thriller &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is available for free on the Epic Games Store from now until June 17th at 11AM ET. All you need is an Epic Games account — just log in to the store while the deal is live, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/control"&gt;claim your copy of the game for PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdjoPp"&gt;If you haven’t played &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; before, I highly recommend picking it up. I really liked exploring the game’s spooky paranormal world, and using protagonist Jesse Faden’s psychic abilities to fling objects from the environment at enemies is a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIMqD0"&gt;Epic is offering &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale"&gt;Mega Sale&lt;/a&gt;, which also runs through June 17th. Like last year, Epic is offering its $10 Epic Coupons that are applied automatically at checkout on eligible games that cost $14.99 or more during the sale. There are also some big discounts on hit games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x7Fvxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Epic’s Mega Sale returns with free NBA 2K21 and deals on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Cyberpunk 2077, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445708/epic-games-mega-sale-free-deals-coupons"},{"title":"Control is an excellent supernatural thriller with hints of Metroid","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The Hoover Dam reservoir is at an all-time low </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tourists Visit The Hoover Dam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChAsHArl0uxSV2BwTQkG0S7c74c=/0x0:4974x3316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433928/1253437187.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A general view of Lake Mead, a human-made lake that lies on the Colorado River, about 24 miles southeast of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the states of Nevada and Arizona, on December 21st, 2019, in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada. Formed by the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States and serves water to the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada, as well as some of Mexico, providing sustenance to nearly 20 million people and large areas of farmland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paul Rovere / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FKF81y"&gt;Lake Mead, the reservoir created by the Hoover Dam, that feeds water to 25 million people across Western states, is historically low. On June 9th, the water level dipped to &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/levels.html"&gt;1,071.57&lt;/a&gt; feet above sea level, narrowly beating a &lt;a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2016/05/19/lake-mead-declines-new-record-low/84597120/"&gt;record low&lt;/a&gt; last set in &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/lakemead_line.pdf"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaQJpU"&gt;The lake surface has dropped 140 feet since 2000, leaving the reservoir just 37 percent full. With such a dramatic drop, officials expect to declare an official &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/05/27/hoover-dam-drought-water-levels-lake-mead/5134031001/"&gt;water shortage&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever. That could affect water and energy that Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam deliver to Arizona, California, and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPeCDY"&gt;Water levels at Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, are &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/24mo/2021/MAY21.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to keep dropping throughout the year. The drought tugging at the lake’s water levels is affecting other states in the region, too. “Please join me and Utahns, regardless of religious affiliation, in a weekend of humble prayer for rain,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in a video plea last week. He declared a state of emergency in March as Utah, like much of the West, plunged deep into drought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GPrABk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amid dangerous drought conditions, we’re inviting all Utahns — regardless of religious affiliation — to join us this weekend in collective and humble prayer for rain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/uJzFARl7BI"&gt;https://t.co/uJzFARl7BI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HS755aXEy3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HS755aXEy3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Utah Gov. Spencer J. Cox (@GovCox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GovCox/status/1400486759561973761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5y0G6"&gt;The West is ablaze in deep red and burgundy on drought &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; for the US, signaling “extreme” to “exceptional drought.” Farmers, who are already abandoning crops for lack of water, are &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/environment/article/Pulling-out-trees-trucking-water-for-cows-16234207.php"&gt;feeling the strain&lt;/a&gt; the most. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A snapshot of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Drought Monitor on June 1st, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-lGE6g3CR0n9C2D5Ybs9C-AInU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649983/usdroughtmonitor_weekly_ndmc__web__2021_06_01.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/data-snapshots/data-source-drought-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;snapshot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Drought Monitor on June 1st, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SPHStz"&gt;It didn’t help that a sweltering spring &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/04/heat-wave-united-states/"&gt;heatwave&lt;/a&gt; hit much of the continental US this past weekend. Las Vegas, some 30 miles from Lake Mead, reached 109 degrees Fahrenheit and could see even higher temperatures &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/weather/looming-heat-wave-could-push-173024866.html"&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;. Altogether, the drought and heat are scary omens for this year’s fire season. An above-normal risk of fire is &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;forecasted&lt;/a&gt; for the Southwest through June, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8T2B2"&gt;In July, the Southwest’s monsoon season is expected to kick in and provide some relief — at least temporarily. &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/"&gt;Climate change has brought on&lt;/a&gt; higher spring and summer temperatures, more severe wildfires, less snow (which much of the West relies on for water), and more intense dry seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWk2Qv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
