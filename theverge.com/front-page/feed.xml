    <title>Vodafone latest UK carrier to reintroduce roaming charges in Europe after Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZNzbEa"&gt;Vodafone has announced it will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reintroduce roaming charges&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for UK mobile customers from January next year. It’s the latest UK carrier to reintroduce the fees after the country’s departure from the European Union, and it follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548668/ee-uk-carrier-roaming-charges-european-union"&gt;similar U-turn from EE&lt;/a&gt; in June. All major carriers in the country &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/major-uk-mobile-networks-vow-not-reintroduce-roaming-charges/"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; they had no plans to introduce roaming fees in Europe after the Brexit vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glGRZq"&gt;The fees will apply to any Vodafone customers who sign up to or change their contract from August 11th, 2021, with the fees applying from January 6th, 2022. Costs are dependent on the specific plan, but most customers will pay £2 ($2.77) a day to use their UK allowance of calls, texts, and data in Europe, or £1 a day if access is bought in eight- or 15-day bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ohPej"&gt;Customers signed up to Vodafone’s “Unlimited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” or “Limited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” will pay no extra fee to use their UK allowance in Europe. All UK Vodafone customers traveling to the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will not have to pay any roaming fees regardless of their contract. Full details of the new payment plans can be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ti7lO"&gt;Roaming charges were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;abolished in the European Union&lt;/a&gt; on June 15th, 2017, but after the UK voted to leave the EU, it had to renegotiate its trade agreements with the bloc. These did not include free mobile roaming, allowing UK carriers to reintroduce fees if they wished. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2020 iPad Pro is $200 off at Best Buy today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ilVCTgnPznFUnwDz1BK9zarRr4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698679/bking_200322_3945_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro 12.9&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAaqy9"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a sale on last year’s iPad Pro now that the new models have been released, today is perhaps your day. Best Buy is taking $200 off all configurations of the 2020 iPad Pro, including both 11- and 12.9-inch sizes and cellular-equipped models. Not all of the configurations are in stock everywhere, but popular options like the 256GB Wi-Fi versions of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748602930599677783#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748602966449170221#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch&lt;/a&gt; are available as of the time of publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3yBDL"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro features Apple’s A12Z processor, a 120Hz display, quad speakers, and a dual rear camera system with lidar. It’s compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil, Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, and Smart Keyboard folio for iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UPkqpx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10692708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hq4jWI"&gt;Best Buy also has a sale on the last-generation Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones. These originally listed at $350 when they launched in 2018, but you can pick them up for $200 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iPDx6"&gt;The WH-1000XM3 are very similar to the newer XM4 model, with excellent battery life and noise cancellation. The main thing you’re giving up is the ability to pair to multiple devices at the same time, but that concession might be worth the savings for you. Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review of the WH-1000XM3 here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N7GjNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aBwIjh"&gt;If you’re looking for earbuds instead of over-ear cans, Amazon has a sale on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/3114c908?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=deals_deals_deals-grid_slot-15_69e1_dt_dcell_tlt_2_3114c908" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wide range of 1More headphones&lt;/a&gt; today, including the top-of-the-line &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphone-Calls-EHD9001TA/dp/B08J46PGHV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Active Noise Cancellation model for $100&lt;/a&gt;, a $50 discount. You can also get the awkwardly named but quite good &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-ComfoBuds-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth/dp/B08V5355R2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ComfoBuds Pro&lt;/a&gt; for as low as $75, down $25 from their usual price. &lt;strong&gt;Check out our reviews of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/29/21157701/1more-true-wireless-anc-headphones-review-noise-canceling-earbuds-price-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1More True Wireless ANC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345692/1more-comfobuds-pro-noise-canceling-earbuds-review-airpods" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ComfoBuds Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZEovC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10692730"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m5RDbi"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Show 8 comes with a faster processor and an upgraded camera system designed to make video calls easier, and today you can save $30 off its regular price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DC4LW6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742759409782754841#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fthis-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The Echo Show 8 is the midsize smart display in Amazon’s lineup and can be used in a kitchen, home office, living room, or anywhere else you can fit it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Samsung’s August Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5LSJypPHZrnZSp5JxQeLknnqQlo=/151x0:1050x599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698607/E7Ow9IyXsAAEUyS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WleRDN"&gt;The next Galaxy Unpacked event is fast approaching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT&lt;/a&gt; — but you might’ve already seen what Samsung has lined up, thanks to a copious amount of leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNoWn8"&gt;Samsung is expected to announce new additions to its high-end line of folding Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip phones. Based on leaks, both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 seem more like refinements to Samsung’s existing designs with the newest specs. The new Fold and Flip should come with new color options and, in the case of the Flip, a reworked outside screen and camera housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9j18tO"&gt;Now that Samsung and Google have revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;their smartwatch partnership with Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like Samsung might also launch two of the first smartwatches to run it. Leaks seem to suggest Samsung will show off a new Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and Galaxy Watch Active 4. The company is also rumored to be updating its line of true wireless earbuds with the Galaxy Buds 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFmZuZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Samsung’s next foldable moves, but ahead of the event, here’s the breakdown of what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZULQKv1zeeuJKAzVV0v4dZAQrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679450/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (tweet now deleted)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 with S Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tv9Bmy"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is gaining a major Note feature: stylus support&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="r5IDMf"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594685/samsung-z-fold-3-stylus-support-note-durability"&gt;has confirmed there won’t be a new Note in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the latest flagship phone to gain access to the Note’s formerly exclusive stylus features. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders/"&gt;Leaked images from &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the Fold will get an optional case that holds Samsung’s S Pen stylus when you’re not using it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df-Rb3lQUoCWfx8LGvHu7TVAxSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741284/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4602QH"&gt;Bundled in its stylus reveal, Samsung also confirmed that the new Fold and Flip will feature improved durability, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case"&gt;with rumors of IPX8 water resistance&lt;/a&gt; possibly supporting part of that claim. Otherwise, it seems like the new Fold will feel like a yet more refined version of the previous two models, offering three color options of green, black, and silver, and a Snapdragon 888 processor. The phone is also expected to have a 7.55-inch interior folding screen and a 6.23-inch external screen, with both rumored to be 120Hz high refresh rate displays, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-fold-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WihO95"&gt;For cameras, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370?s=20"&gt;prolific leaker Evan Blass suggests&lt;/a&gt; the Fold will feature three 12-megapixel rear cameras, one of which will be an ultrawide and the other telephoto, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The exterior selfie camera is expected to be 10 megapixels, while the inside selfie camera is rumored to only be 4 megapixels but possibly housed under the Fold’s inside panel. Samsung Display has teased its work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230521/samsung-display-under-panel-camera-laptop-webcam-oled-bezels"&gt;under-panel cameras in the past for laptops&lt;/a&gt;, so it's possible the company could debut something similar with the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUwp_n_ImCHiueUlb_cbu4yHlPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764805/E7zXe5GXEAAM7tj.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked render of the yellow Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1nyvu5"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 has a tweaked design and larger cover screen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="UKfSTW"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is expected to feature a new exterior design with vertically stacked 12-megapixel rear cameras and a larger 1.9-inch cover display for notifications and selfie camera shots. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1422248661271162887?s=20"&gt;Leaked renders from Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; show the device coming in at least four colors: light purple, light yellow, grayish-green, and black.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qrb8cxoGcRIF5FQz7wT2C9Iuweg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22770781/Screenshot_2021_08_08_10.17.53_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned front cover of the Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S9nVyY"&gt;The interior screen of the Flip 3 is rumored to be &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-3/"&gt;the same 6.5-inch display size&lt;/a&gt; as the original Z Flip but with a new 120Hz high refresh rate display. The interior hole-punch selfie camera will reportedly sport a 10-megapixel sensor. This might not be a dramatic interior change from the first Galaxy Z Flip, but leaked renders suggest that Samsung may have also shrunk the bezels of the Flip 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqpWTZ"&gt;Like Samsung’s other flagship phones, the Flip 3 will likely be powered by the Snapdragon 888 and, in the case of the Flip 3, the same 8GB of RAM as the first Flip, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rumored Galaxy Watch or Active 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="jHlNxl"&gt;The new Galaxy Watches might fit more wrists&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qrL1Cc"&gt;Samsung is expected to introduce at least two new smartwatches at Wednesday’s event. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt; will reportedly feature a more traditional watch shape, with a rotating bezel and 42mm, 44mm, and 46mm sizes, which should at least give people more size options to play with. The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is rumored to come in two finishes, aluminum or stainless steel, both of which will be water-resistant in depths of up to 50 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOVAOg"&gt;The more sleek and modern &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; (or Galaxy Watch 4 Active, it’s not entirely clear) will reportedly come with two side buttons and in either 40mm or 44mm sizes. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; you’ll be able to choose from watches in either black, olive green, rose gold, or silver, with additional customizations for watch bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbtmPH"&gt;Both watches are expected to run Samsung and Google’s new co-developed Wear OS 3. Not much is known about it, but leaks have definitely seemed to show it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22604862/samsung-galaxy-watch-photos-images-leaked-classic-4-wear-smartwatch-os-google"&gt;running on both of Samsung’s new watches&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung also showed some of what its skinned One UI version of Wear OS 3 would look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;at Mobile World Congress earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Leaked renders of Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="FtxMJ0"&gt;New Galaxy Buds 2 with improved sound in a variety of colors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="i9nhWr"&gt;Samsung’s next set of true wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;the Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, don’t seem wildly different from its original pair in terms of design. They are, however, expected to come in new colors and feature improved noise reduction abilities, possibly helped by silicone ear tips similar to the ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Samsung included in the Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFe3Ro"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are rumored to come in green (some renders look like the inside of a pistachio), pink, black, and white. The new case for the Buds 2 also seems to lift some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;the design elements of the Pixel Buds A-series&lt;/a&gt;: uniform white exterior, with a colored interior that matches the buds themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldX4YS"&gt;It’s not clear what kind of battery life gains the new Galaxy Buds 2 could pack in, but Federal Communications Commission filings &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-buds-2-fcc-leak/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show the device’s charging case has a 500mAh battery, and each earbud will have a 60mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve is working with AMD to make the Steam Deck Windows 11-ready</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNE657cp415NelqQ-dyarfeuSzs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698175/shollister_210805_4698_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vC3yB"&gt;Valve is aiming to make its Steam Deck handheld gaming PC ready for Windows 11. While we’ve known for weeks that the Steam Deck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;can run Windows&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t clear how well this would be supported by Valve, or whether an option for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)&lt;/a&gt; would be enabled to get Windows 11 on the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WrWAX"&gt;Now, Valve has confirmed it has been heavily focused on Windows support. “There’s work looking at TPM just now,” says Greg Coomer, a Valve Steam Deck designer, in &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-deck-windows-11-tpm-compatibility/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve focused so much on Windows 10, so far, that we haven’t really gotten that far into it. Our expectation is that we can meet that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKSqvN"&gt;Valve is working with AMD to make sure that TPM is supported at a BIOS level, and that the Steam Deck is ready for Windows 11. “So there’s nothing to indicate to us yet that there’ll be any issues with Windows 11,” explains Coomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="shL8ef"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve’s new Steam Deck can run Windows and turn into a handheld Xbox ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"},{"title":"Valve Steam Deck hands-on: the Nintendo Switch of PC gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VJvk98"&gt;That sounds encouraging for the ability to install Windows 11 on the Steam Deck once it launches later this year. While the handheld device will ship with SteamOS, a custom version of Linux, Valve will support Windows installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBaS1D"&gt;So why would you want Windows on the Steam Deck? Valve is still working on getting games with anti-cheat to run out of the box on this handheld, and it’s not guaranteed that titles like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gears 5 &lt;/em&gt;will work without Windows. “We’re working with BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat to get support for Proton ahead of launch,” &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq"&gt;says Valve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HldK20"&gt;The Steam Deck uses Valve’s Proton software to get a lot of officially unsupported Windows games to run on the device, but anti-cheat has been the biggest headache for Proton in recent years. Windows support avoids the obvious compatibility issues here, but it will bring with it an interface that isn’t tailored to a 7-inch screen, and lots of unknowns until we see just how well the OS works on the Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pushes back against child abuse scanning concerns in new FAQ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3UQv-Ep-FwzGk_VnzIk8s6KW_1M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698169/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGzBGm"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has attempted to assuage concerns that its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;anti-child abuse measures&lt;/a&gt; could be turned into surveillance tools by authoritarian governments. “Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM [child sexual abuse material] stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeChzT"&gt;Apple’s new tools, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;announced last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, include two features designed to protect children. One, called “communication safety,” uses on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in the Messages app, and can notify a parent if a child age 12 and younger decides to view or send such an image. The second is designed to detect known CSAM by scanning users’ images if they choose to upload them to iCloud. Apple is notified if CSAM is detected, and it will alert the authorities when it verifies such material exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G0Hzjw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple’s CSAM detection capability is built solely to detect known CSAM images”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QqqbpC"&gt;The plans met with a swift backlash from digital &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;privacy groups and campaigners&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that these introduce a backdoor into Apple’s software. These groups note that once such a backdoor exists there is always the potential for it to be expanded to scan for types of content that go beyond child sexual abuse material. Authoritarian governments could use it to scan for politically dissent material, or anti-LGBT regimes could use it to crack down on sexual expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A2zHQ"&gt;“Even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor,” the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve already seen this mission creep in action. One of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a database of ‘terrorist’ content that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArY2kw"&gt;However, Apple argues that it has safeguards in place to stop its systems from being used to detect anything other than sexual abuse imagery. It says that its list of banned images is provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other child safety organizations, and that the system “only works with CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child safety organizations.” Apple says it won’t add to this list of image hashes, and that the list is the same across all iPhones and iPads to prevent individual targeting of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5ce9I"&gt;The company also says that it will refuse demands from governments to add non-CSAM images to the list. “We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future,” it says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkMQzE"&gt;It’s worth noting that despite Apple’s assurances, the company has made concessions to governments in the past in order to continue operating in their countries. It sells &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204170#:~:text=FaceTime%20isn%27t%20available%20or,iPod%20touch%20in%20Saudi%20Arabia.&amp;amp;text=Search%20for%20the%20FaceTime%20app%20in%20Spotlight%20or%20using%20Siri."&gt;iPhones without FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; in countries that don’t allow encrypted phone calls, and in China it’s removed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374246/apple-china-chinese-operations-restrictions"&gt;thousands of apps from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, as well as moved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;store user data on the servers of a state-run telecom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1f0jU"&gt;The FAQ also fails to address some concerns about the feature that scans Messages for sexually explicit material. The feature does not share any information with Apple or law enforcement, the company says, but it doesn’t say how it’s ensuring that the tool’s focus remains solely on sexually explicit images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXy2yk"&gt;“All it would take to widen the narrow backdoor that Apple is building is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content, or a tweak of the configuration flags to scan, not just children’s, but anyone’s accounts,” wrote the EFF. The EFF also notes that machine-learning technologies frequently classify this content incorrectly, and cites &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/tossedout/tumblr-ban-adult-content"&gt;Tumblr’s attempts to crack down on sexual content&lt;/a&gt; as a prominent example of where the technology has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SteamVR beta lets you arrange desktop windows inside your virtual world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/is9-k_gW9UY3Gy3jnHGeUHbBeXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69697994/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="65t9Xd"&gt;As of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/2979680118212870441"&gt;latest beta release&lt;/a&gt;, Valve’s SteamVR software can add floating desktop windows inside VR games, letting you keep an eye on other apps without leaving VR. It’s a helpful addition, allowing players to keep an eye on anything from Discord, to a Twitch chat, or Netflix during a lower-intensity game. &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-update-1-19-6-floating-desktop-windows/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Road to VR&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; you could even watch YouTube during longer flights in &lt;em&gt;Elite Dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Icnn"&gt;The ability to interact with the rest of your desktop from within SteamVR’s dashboard is not a new feature, but recently Valve has been making the system more flexible. Earlier this year it added the option to view individual application windows in the dashboard, and to be virtually &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-beta-update-virtual-desktop-window-view-controller-attach/"&gt;attached to VR controllers&lt;/a&gt; ingame. This made apps viewable at a glance, but until now it lacked the ability to float windows persistently ingame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fSTlR7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Windows are view-only when the SteamVR menu is closed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FiA3PQ"&gt;With the latest release, you can still opt to have a window attached to your controller, or pull it off to have it float in virtual space. The windows are view-only while you’re actually playing a game, but you can open up the SteamVR menu to interact with them using a VR controller as a mouse pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kY2Ui"&gt;The new floating windows are available as of version 1.19.6 of SteamVR. This version of the software is currently available in beta, but it’s relatively easy to opt in via SteamVR’s properties window (accessible by right clicking it in your Steam games list). Despite all the new features being added to the VR platform, there’s still no sign of version 2.0 of SteamVR that Valve &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697229969000435735"&gt;teased early last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVV42B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuHFq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New report reveals how the climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Southeast Texas Inundated After Harvey Makes Second Pass Over The Region" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oCAEcIdhTjlHTPH-shO53PhcM20=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69697962/841346500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A home is surrounded by floodwater after torrential rains pounded Southeast Texas following Hurricane and Tropical Storm Harvey on August 31, 2017 near Orange, Texas. Researchers later determined that climate change supercharged the storm, and was was responsible for up to $67 billion of the $90 billion in damage caused by Harvey.  | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bZMAGw"&gt;We now have the clearest picture yet of how different the world is today as a result of human-driven climate change. The most comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; to date on the physical science of climate change was published today by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ4DzF"&gt;“Climate change is a problem that is here now. Nobody’s safe, and it’s getting worse faster,” Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme said in a press conference today. “We must treat climate change as an immediate threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNxERe"&gt;Extreme events — from floods to heatwaves and droughts — have gotten worse, it says in a nutshell. And scientists are even more certain than they were before that humans’ greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane (which makes up a majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;“natural gas”&lt;/a&gt;), are to blame.				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vvZesy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nobody’s safe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UpZ1jU"&gt;“We’ve known for decades that the world is warming, but this report tells us that recent changes in the climate are widespread, rapid, intensifying, and unprecedented in thousands of years,” Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC, said in an August 8th press briefing. “It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkkWOd"&gt;The IPCC is considered a leading authority on climate science, and its new report has more than 230 authors from 66 countries around the world. Today’s findings are an update to a similar report in 2013, and they incorporate the body of research that’s been published in scientific journals since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbLNKp"&gt;Researchers have gotten a lot better at judging how much climate change affects individual weather events since 2013, which makes a big difference this time around. For example: in July, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;record-smashing heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in the US Pacific Northwest and Southwest Canada &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled roads&lt;/a&gt; and killed hundreds of people. In less than two weeks, an international team of researchers was able to determine that the extreme heat would have been “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWEB1l"&gt;Nearly every region of the world outside of polar regions have seen an uptick in extreme heat events since the 1950s, according to the new IPCC report. Across the globe, extreme heatwaves now occur five times more frequently than they did between 1850 and 1900 (a baseline often referred to as the pre-industrial period), according to the report. Heat also exacerbates drought in some regions of the world. Droughts that previously only occurred once every decade are now 70 percent more frequent than they were in the pre-industrial era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfQa18"&gt;The consequences of the climate crisis, however, are diverse and far-reaching. Severe storms and floods are another growing problem. What were previously once-in-a-decade downpours are happening 30 percent more frequently today. When it comes to tropical cyclones, there’s a greater proportion of major storms (ranked a category 3 or higher), meaning hurricanes and typhoons have grown stronger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="S6VzKU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Extreme weather is occurring with more frequency across the entire planet.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bzSLst"&gt;“Extreme weather is occurring with more frequency across the entire planet,” Paola Andrea Arias Gómez, one of the authors of the IPCC report, said during yesterday’s press briefing. “We now can attribute that these changes are mainly driven by human activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrzcdS"&gt;More bad news: without drastic action to curb the use of fossil fuels, things will get worse. Leading climate experts have set a target of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; in order to avoid some of the worst-case scenarios that climate change could create. We’ve already reached 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming, and the report says we could reach or even surpass that dreaded 1.5 degree threshold within the next couple of decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVcw4V"&gt;What does that mean for extreme weather? Get ready for more “unprecedented” events — basically, things that have never happened before. The report authors outline five ways this is expected to happen in the future: extreme events will be even more extreme. They’ll be more frequent. There’s a greater chance of extreme events happening back to back or even different kinds of disasters happening at the same time. They’ll happen in places that surprise us. And the timing of these catastrophes will be unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5LCNN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This report is a reality check.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1zD5gc"&gt;There are all sorts of other problems detailed in the new report, including vanishing ice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;rising sea levels&lt;/a&gt;, and scary tipping points that could accelerate the pace of the climate crisis. There are also two more key reports expected to be published by the IPCC early next year: one that details how all of these changes to the planet will affect human life as we know it and another one that outlines potential solutions. Notably, today’s report is the only one that will be ready in time for the upcoming United Nations climate conference in November when world leaders are expected to discuss ratcheting up commitments to rein in their planet-heating pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8SK5P"&gt;“This report is a reality check,” Valérie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC working group responsible for the report, said in a press release. “We now have a much clearer picture of the past, present and future climate, which is essential for understanding where we are headed, what can be done, and how we can prepare.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYugur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 9th 5:00AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from IPCC press conference. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Venom: Let There be Carnage, Y: The Last Man, The Great, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QYzqD4pbYardYyE7FzX7HJ_9I28=/211x0:1600x926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69696725/venom_carnage.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Woody Harrelson and Tom Hardy star in Venom: Let There Be Carnage | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FmWuCgJmxo" target="_blank"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PEGNRi"&gt;So in addition to watching &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, missing &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesdays, and keeping my Paramount Plus subscription current so I can watch the extremely underappreciated show &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt;, I’m still slogging through &lt;em&gt;Manifest. &lt;/em&gt;I’m halfway through Season 2,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the plot has become weirdly elaborate and yet the show remains so cheesy that I must see how things end up. Of course, we’re awaiting word from Netflix about whether there will be any seasons past the show’s third, but &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflix-reconsiders-saving-manifest-1234985839/"&gt;recent developments look promising&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81Po6J"&gt;On to the latest trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qn494F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EEQ5Lj-cXM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2gDEc"&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="e6eDfe"&gt;The very long-awaited show based on the comic book series of the same name by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra is finally arriving. Every mammal in the world with a Y chromosome is suddenly wiped out, except for a dude named Yorick (alas) and his pet monkey, and chaos ensues, of course. Ben Schnetzer, Ashley Romans, Olivia Thirlby, and Diane Lane star in the series &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; (which FX has said &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/timothy-hutton-replaced-y-the-last-man-fx-1234818302/"&gt;would have all-female&lt;/a&gt; directors). It comes to FX on Hulu September 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7LZnJC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-FmWuCgJmxo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IS9QmU"&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DzZPBY"&gt;There is plenty of carnage in this sequel to 2018’s &lt;em&gt;Venom, &lt;/em&gt;but the title also refers to Carnage the former serial killer who also becomes host of an alien symbiote and (our hero?) Venom’s enemy. Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Williams, and Naomie Harris star in &lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Andy Serkis. It comes to theaters this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5pcwgx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azqXzb0xeBI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWHmxC"&gt;The Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Hxmn5p"&gt;I have grumbled before about the difference between teasers (short) and trailers (longer) but here comes the “date announcement.” At some point we’ll presumably get a teaser and/or a trailer for Season 2 of the very funny and raunchy &lt;em&gt;The Great&lt;/em&gt;, but for now we get Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult trading quips in period costumes. &lt;em&gt;The Great&lt;/em&gt; returns to Hulu November 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fLEO1a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdbXnboJCVw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DLHA4l"&gt;Army of Thieves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8wXVwx"&gt;Of all the characters from Zack Snyder’s summer zombie flick &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; to get a prequel, the safecracking Dieter ... was not the first one I thought of. Here, he’s a bank teller who gets drawn into a criminal ring who want to crack safes across Europe (and he’s heard something about the outbreak in America turning people into flesh-eating monsters). And FYI the &lt;s&gt;trailer&lt;/s&gt;, sorry the teaser, only shows zombies on “news reports.” Co-written by Snyder and directed by Dieter himself, aka Matthias Schweighöfer, &lt;em&gt;Army of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; also stars Nathalie Emmanuel, and Ruby O. Fee. No release date yet, but it’s coming soon to Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vuynKK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MysGjRS9jFU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOdWRD"&gt;Kate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vY6ksk"&gt;An assassin is poisoned just before a hit on an Asian bad guy and she has a matter of hours to find out who killed her. I’m not sure whether it’s that the “lady assassin” plot seems familiar and a bit tired, or if it’s just particularly unsettling to watch a white woman kill a slew of Asians on screen while there’s been an &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22558949/china-violence-asian-americans"&gt;uptick in violence against AAPI people&lt;/a&gt; in the real world, but this trailer isn’t quite doing it for me. Perhaps I am wrong (it has been known to happen) after all, this is only two minutes and 45 seconds worth of the movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Woody Harrelson, and Miku Martineau star in &lt;em&gt;Kate&lt;/em&gt;, which hits Netflix on September 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla will reportedly require workers at its Nevada battery factory to wear masks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8UXpcjXsCc888Egumj6vc6qG8Jg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69696290/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla will reportedly require masks as its Nevada plant | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kXhAhv"&gt;All Tesla workers at the company’s battery factory in Reno, Nevada will be required to wear masks indoors beginning Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-require-masks-at-nevada-battery-factory-11628444515?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The plant already required workers unvaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors, but the new rule includes vaccinated workers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUexZ"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/nevada"&gt;Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center,&lt;/a&gt; Nevada has seen more than 26,000 new COVID infections in the past month, and 298 deaths. The center estimates that nearly 47 percent of the state’s population has been vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJLkfZ"&gt;At the beginning of the pandemic last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed back against COVID restrictions, including stay-at-home orders in Alameda County, California, where its Fremont plant is located. While the company eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21187419/tesla-factory-shutdown-fremont-new-york-gigafactory-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;agreed to temporarily shut down operations&lt;/a&gt; at the Fremont facility in March 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254871/tesla-fremont-shutdown-factory-production-model-3-y-elon-musk"&gt;Musk announced in May&lt;/a&gt; 2020 that he was reopening the plant in defiance of local shelter-in-place orders, going so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;sue the county&lt;/a&gt; and threatening to move Tesla operations out of California. In November, Musk tweeted that he likely had a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1327743762273955841?s=20"&gt;moderate case of covid&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAxEQP"&gt;On August 3rd of this year, California &lt;a href="https://covid-19.acgov.org/face-masks.page?"&gt;updated its mask rules&lt;/a&gt;, requiring everyone 2 years of age and older to wear masks in indoor public settings, regardless of vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmEkb3"&gt;Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak revived that state’s &lt;a href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.29.21-Mask-Guidance-1.pdf"&gt;mask mandate&lt;/a&gt; late last month, just ahead of new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People in Nevada must wear face masks indoors in public in counties that have “substantial or high transmission,” which included Clark, where Las Vegas is located, and Washoe, where Reno is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry6n1W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Report finds Doximity, a social network for doctors, is riddled with anti-vaccine comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2VDmQLz5KrbmaliVTHpOnEVTn0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69692977/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vaccine misinformation appears rampant on a social media site for doctors | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H5wAkq"&gt;A social media site for doctors is seeing “hundreds of comments”— many with false claims and conspiracy theories— on posts about the COVID-19 vaccine and the pandemic, according to a new report &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Doximity is limited to healthcare professionals in the US— it verifies members before they can join— and no one who posts to the site is anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Y9VI"&gt;Doximity also doesn’t allow users to post articles or stories; instead it posts items from medical and science publications and mainstream news articles. Each user has a feed of aggregated content that is customized for them, based on the user’s preferences including area of medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9If3m"&gt;But Doximity members &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; comment on articles, which is where the misinformation and conspiracy theories seem to proliferate, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported. For instance, it found comments on a recent article about face masks for children included many from doctors who oppose the vaccine, saying masking children was “ridiculous” and “a form of child abuse.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoM8DV"&gt;This, despite the overwhelming evidence and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"&gt;guidance from public health organizations&lt;/a&gt; that masks help prevent the spread of the virus, and, the fact that there &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-next-stage-of-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-in-united-states-children-under-12/"&gt;isn’t yet a  COVID-19 vaccine approved&lt;/a&gt; for children under 12 years old. And, despite rules in Doximity’s own &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/clinicians/community_guidelines"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; which list “spreading false or misleading information” as grounds for removal from the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5x1q7"&gt;Doximity is scheduled to release its &lt;a href="https://investors.doximity.com/news/events/event-details/2021/Doximity-Q1-2022-Earnings-Call/default.aspx"&gt;first-quarter results&lt;/a&gt; on August 10th. The company, which was founded in 2010, launched its IPO in June, and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021012935/doximity-424b4.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that it had 1.8 million members, which included 80 percent of physicians in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1jpl"&gt;A spokesperson for Doximity wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company has community guidelines in place that are meant to keep the site a safe, respectful environment. “While we encourage our members to share their views in our comments section, we explicitly prohibit the sharing of medical misinformation,” the spokesperson added. “Our policies reflect Doximity’s strong commitment to addressing and removing medical misinformation. As such, we employ a rigorous clinical review process, staffed by physicians, to evaluate member comments that are flagged as being potential misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4vlpZ"&gt;You can read &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;’s full report here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
