    <title>Apple says SharePlay won’t be part of initial iOS 15 release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV1QOYraAdCGnrD9LKF3x-VKrc=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737506/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCkPhu"&gt;One of iOS 15’s marquee new features, SharePlay, has been delayed and now won’t be rolled out until after the major update is released this fall. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/"&gt;Apple has informed developers&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will be disabled in the next betas of iOS 15, iPadOS15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. SharePlay allows people to enjoy entertainment (TV shows, movies, music, etc.) together at the same time and syncs everything up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlzp23"&gt;The company has confirmed that this feature will be absent in the official release of iOS 15 when it widely rolls out in the fall. Apple now says that SharePlay will return “in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOg5i"&gt;“We’re thrilled with the high level of enthusiasm we’ve seen from the developer community for SharePlay, and we can’t wait to bring it to users so that they can experience your apps with their friends and family in a whole new way,” Apple said in its update to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4G10w"&gt;This is the first major new aspect of iOS 15 to be pulled back from the launch release, but it will undoubtedly raise questions about which other features might also have to wait for a later update. Apple has yet to include Universal Control, one of the most impressive tricks it showed off at WWDC, in any of this summer’s beta releases. Universal Control will allow iPad and Mac owners to work seamlessly across both products with the same keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLdpC"&gt;Apple has held back some of its promised features from previous major iOS releases until they were more polished and ready to go. As just one example, Group FaceTime was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684154/apple-group-facetime-chats-delay-ios-12"&gt;delayed from the initial release of iOS 12&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 until a smaller update that rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18040034/apple-ios-12-1-release-date-october-30-features-group-facetime-beautygate"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAdXX"&gt;Check out our preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; for a rundown of all the new features that Apple says will be available — at some point, anyway — later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thrilling new trailer for Star Wars’ anime anthology series is filled with action and style</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SEyH5zBawmDceiZJ9RimJi59lQs=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737205/star_wars_visions_trailer_tall_28fja0_1_1024x576.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4Fx6o"&gt;Disney has shared an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAsl-0o3O0"&gt;impressive trailer for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its anime anthology series premiering September 22nd on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1128412/9358?subId1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus.&lt;/a&gt; The trailer oozes style and flair, and it looks like the series will tell some thrilling new stories in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTxk8H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; will feature nine animated shorts from seven anime studios. Disney also revealed the English dub voice cast, which features some big names including Alison Brie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Harbour, Neil Patrick Harris, Lucy Liu, and Temuera Morrison (who is reprising his role as Boba Fett). You can see more of the cast here on &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast"&gt;the official &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;. And Disney says that you’ll be able to watch the series both with the English dub cast and the original Japanese voice cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTtHZ9"&gt;The series is the latest &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; show to hit Disney Plus. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; premiered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418964/star-wars-the-bad-batch-disney-plus-streaming"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; series on the horizon, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a spinoff starring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168641/star-wars-andor-cassian-disney-plus-2022-diego-luna"&gt;Diego Luna as Cassian Andor from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones appear again in leaked promotional photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-F405X-1BdHBLozQ7-qZT3RG88s=/0x0:1025x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737199/1DCA3BF9_1097_47CE_BF94_B3A57331EC07.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfMEWb"&gt;After first surfacing last month in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583264/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-qc45-fcc-filing-leak"&gt;an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; (which Bose quickly withdrew), the company’s upcoming QuietComfort 45 headphones have now been leaked more extensively &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html"&gt;courtesy of &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Set to be priced at $329, the QC45s certainly look the part of a successor to the popular QC35s. The overall design is very similar, with some modern refinements like a USB-C port thrown in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoVaAr"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the QC45s will offer active noise cancellation, an Aware Mode for piping in outside noise, and be tuned with Bose’s signature Active EQ. Battery life is expected to be up to 24 hours of continuous playback. A quick 15-minute charge will give the headphones 2.5 hours of listening time. Multipoint pairing to two devices at the same time will be supported. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-N2iBnHsDVWeDgAcbRgCixkB970=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787786/CB3B0436_173C_43FB_9B53_DD2757BB905F.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QC45s looks very similar to the prior QC35II headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zT8MDP"&gt;Bose’s last flagship headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a much different, more premium design than the QC35s. They also gave customers more control over the balance of noise cancellation and ambient sound. But they came with their own set of tradeoffs. The headphones couldn’t be folded down for compact storage, and they couldn’t match the airy comfort of Bose’s prior cans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCgLy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t know how strong the ANC on the QC45s will be, but Bose has every reason to exceed expectations. With the QC35 and QC35II headphones, there was a long saga where some customers insisted that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696186/bose-qc35ii-headphones-worse-noise-cancellation-problems"&gt;noise cancellation had been rendered less effective&lt;/a&gt; after a firmware update. There were enough complaints for Bose to conduct an in-depth examination of the perceived problem, and it even sought out independent third-party testing. But the company ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209974/bose-qc35-qc35ii-noise-canceling-investigation-firmware"&gt;concluded that its firmware hadn’t caused any ANC degradation&lt;/a&gt; and pointed to “hardware related issues with ear cushions, aftermarket parts, or mechanical integrity” as the reason some customers ran into problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOs2xF"&gt;With the QuietComfort 45s leaking to this degree, it seems an official release can’t be that much farther off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 to require proof of vaccination for attendees, exhibitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The 2017 Consumer Electronics Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/on9xFC5AOs8eX89IBNpF98XI8sA=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737042/631003660.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9okc1"&gt;After an online-only event this year, the CTA is still planning to put on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407494/ces-2022-in-person-conference-event-tech-show-las-vegas-january"&gt;CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; as a hybrid event with in-person and digital components. Today &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=c2667de6-cc7d-4887-beb7-e216f165a584"&gt;the CTA announced&lt;/a&gt; that if you’re planning on showing up in Las Vegas, then you will need to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uv8nzp"&gt;PROOF OF COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHhcSr"&gt;On August 17, CTA announced that all attendees and exhibitors will need to show proof of vaccination in order to attend CES. CTA continues to monitor guidelines for health safety measures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nevada and Clark County. CTA will follow applicable federal, state and local laws, adapting CES plans accordingly and sharing updates with you and other CES audiences. We are also working closely with the Las Vegas community, including the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, exhibit venues and hotels, and if they adjust their plans, we will communicate that as well. While the situation will continue to evolve over the coming months, read the information below for just some of the precautions we will implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DBYUtc"&gt;Navigating the CES show floor without picking up an infectious disease is tricky even when there isn’t a global pandemic, so the guidelines shouldn’t come as a surprise. The announcement comes at the same time as New York City rolls out its&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607882/key-to-nyc-pass-covid-vaccine-proof-new-york-city"&gt; Key to NYC Pass&lt;/a&gt; plan, and concert promoter &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/live-nation-updates-covid-19-vaccination-negative-test-1212323/"&gt;Live Nation says it will require vaccination or a negative test&lt;/a&gt; for attendees and crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdLSeL"&gt;As far as those who are not vaccinated, whether by their own choice or because they live somewhere without access to vaccines, the CTA says it’s “assessing the acceptance of proof of a positive antibody test as an alternative requirement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MJLmB"&gt;It’s also unknown how this will apply to events happening beyond the show floor and keynote ballrooms, or outside the CTA’s umbrella entirely. We expect to hear more details about all of this long before the CES 2022 media days start on January 3rd, or when the show floor opens on January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Platforms struggle with Taliban policy amid chaotic US withdrawal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Four men facing away from the camera carry military rifles along an empty street, flanked by concrete barriers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_pSXXPwdkdbfc9uWZERh8hz0LI=/0x0:4783x3189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736955/1234727262.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Taliban fighters patrol a road in Kabul | Photo by WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywR2hD"&gt;Social platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are coming under new scrutiny for the way they treat Taliban accounts, as the militant Islamist group emerges as the dominant power in Afghanistan in the wake of the US withdrawal. While none of the platforms have publicly changed their policies on the group, moderation practices have come under close scrutiny, and many are shifting resources to ensure the policies are appropriately enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRAVaz"&gt;A particular question &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/17/technology-202-facebook-twitter-youtube-face-high-stakes-question-whether-recognize-taliban/"&gt;raised by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is whether the group will be allowed to wrest control of the official Facebook and Twitter accounts for the government of Afghanistan. While the Taliban has seized effective control over the government, granting access to official accounts could be seen as legitimizing their control over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6TRkkB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JisP0r"&gt;Despite a number of official bans, Taliban forces appear to have embraced tech platforms when reclaiming territory. Early Monday, an official spokesperson for the Taliban &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1427126736026836995"&gt;used Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to claim control of the capital city of Kabul, saying the situation there was “under control.” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/taliban-leaders-used-twitter-and-whatsapp-to-help-capture-kabul/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Taliban officials were circulating WhatsApp numbers that could be used by former regime members to coordinate surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGljGP"&gt;The Taliban is officially banned from all Facebook services, including WhatsApp, but the service’s end-to-end encryption makes it easy for Taliban accounts to avoid moderation action. A WhatsApp spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; that moderators take action against violating accounts when moderators become aware of them — but without access to user communications, it is rare that WhatsApp would become aware of a Taliban account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmBSEg"&gt;Twitter does not have a blanket policy on Taliban activity, but told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it takes action against accounts violating existing rules against violent content or platform manipulation. “The situation in Afghanistan is rapidly evolving,” a spokesperson said. “We’re also witnessing people in the country using Twitter to seek help and assistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVHW1g"&gt;Reached for comment by The Verge, YouTube said it terminates all Taliban-linked accounts based on its interpretation of US sanctions law. “YouTube complies with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws, including relevant &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20061219"&gt;U.S. sanctions&lt;/a&gt;,” a representative said. “As such, if we find an account believed to be owned and operated by the Afghan Taliban, we terminate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Czo5"&gt;Facebook has designated the Taliban as a dangerous organization, which means it removes accounts representing the group and prohibits praise or support of it in user posts. The company has devoted more resources to enforcing that policy in light of the ongoing unrest in Kabul. Still, the company said it is waiting for guidance from outside organizations as to whether the Taliban should be recognized as the de facto government of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnF7yh"&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country but instead respects the authority of the international community in making these determinations,” a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Regardless of who holds power, we will take the appropriate action against accounts and content that breaks our rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hswf54"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:10pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from YouTube spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5A comes with a bigger battery and screen, smaller price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vCRMtLNtw-FxlEYDSAOV8ZwR-_I=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736882/Pixel_5a_5G_Product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch display and IP67 water-resistance rating.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVJd9p"&gt;Google has officially revealed the Pixel 5A 5G, a phone it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;kind of announced in April&lt;/a&gt; to contradict rumors that it had been canceled. It comes with a short list of updated features compared to its 4A 5G predecessor, including a slightly bigger screen, a much bigger battery, and an IP67 rating for water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UkhGL"&gt;Few though they may be, these are some important tweaks to an already good midrange phone, and the best part is that the price has gotten smaller: in the US it will cost $449, which is $50 less than the Pixel 4A 5G’s introductory price. The 5A goes on sale in the US and Japan on August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dLQBUh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22392246"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUk7QBzrXEbAutV8xElm6bDgbU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786010/Pixel_5a_5G_Lifestyle_Charging__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5A supports wired charging only, and Google says it’s the last Pixel phone that will ship with a charger in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dFP4Ys"&gt;The Pixel 5A’s screen gets a slight boost to 6.34 inches, a small increase over the 4A 5G’s 6.2-inch display. It’s still a 1080p OLED with a standard 60Hz refresh rate, despite rumors of a faster 90Hz display. The battery gets an increase to 4,680mAh, up from 3,885mAh, which Google says will last through a full day of typical use or two days using Extreme Battery Saver mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94D0WL"&gt;The 5A is also the first A-series Pixel to get an official water resistance rating. With IP67 protection, the phone is able to withstand immersion in up to three feet of water for up to 30 minutes. That’s an uncommon feature in the under-$500 class where IP ratings are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KozyrT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10704284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xagOMn"&gt;The Pixel 5A works on all major US carrier networks and continues to offer support for sub-6GHz 5G. Unlike last year, Google will not sell a mmWave-compatible version of the phone. That’s no great loss — mmWave 5G is very fast, but range is highly limited and hard to find. Unfortunately, the 5A is also missing support for C-band 5G frequencies, which Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T will start using at the end of this year to bolster their struggling nationwide 5G networks. Google says it could add the necessary software support later, but won’t commit to doing so at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9NKf7G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0wE2W"&gt;Other specs remain unchanged from the previous model. It still uses a Snapdragon 765G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 12.2-megapixel main and 16-megapixel ultrawide rear cameras and 8-megapixel selfie camera are the same. There’s a rear fingerprint scanner for biometric unlock, an honest-to-god headphone jack, and an 18W charger included in the box (Google says this will be the last Pixel phone to offer one). The phone will ship with Android 11 and is guaranteed Google’s standard three years of OS platform updates and security patch support. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tZCRck"&gt;Unlike the 4A 5G, the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US. Instead, it’ll be offered directly from the Google Store and through Google Fi. It will be sold in just one finish — “mostly black” — with four colorful case options available separately to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Pixel 6 won’t ship with a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWtKPEFDCN0HQefeC0SXQdK8RF0=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736930/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google joins Apple and Samsung by ditching the in-box charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hXmmGZ"&gt;Google is the latest manufacturer to bid farewell to the in-box charging brick, saying it expects the Pixel 5A will be the last phone to include one. That means the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; won’t include one when they arrive this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWjePu"&gt;The company says that most people already have a USB-C charging brick, so there’s no longer a need to include one with its phones. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231954/samsung-to-gradually-remove-chargers-earbuds-from-future-phones"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; made similar arguments when they announced they would no longer be offering an in-box charger. That may be true, but it’s likely that the cost savings of not including a charger played a big role in those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says it expects the Pixel 5A to be the last phone to include the charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aAa6hI"&gt;There’s also an environmental argument for ditching the charger: fewer redundant chargers being shipped to customers theoretically reduces e-waste. That’s tough to prove, though, and potentially just means that the greenhouse gas emissions of producing and shipping accessory chargers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;will be spread around between more companies&lt;/a&gt; as people buy them from third-party manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vxa6t"&gt;One thing seems certain, though: with these three major phone manufacturers committed to removing the charger, smaller companies will have an easier time following suit and doing the same. While phone shoppers may feel like it’s a case of paying the same price and getting less, this is likely a reality that we’ll all have to make peace with, so hold your wall chargers tight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smart updates and a lower price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KnsKmq"&gt;Google is revealing a phone this year where it’s pulling out all the stops and going big on a cutting-edge, in-house designed SoC, upgraded camera specs, and a bold new look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoPVNC"&gt;That phone is not the Pixel 5A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsYSkQ"&gt;If those kinds of show-stopping improvements are what you’re looking for, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;I’d like to point you to the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, coming this fall. The new Pixel 5A on the other hand, is kind of a boring update by comparison. The screen is a bit bigger this time around, there’s an IP rating for water resistance, and the battery gets a decent boost. That’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZbJNX"&gt;Here’s the thing, though: the Pixel 4A and 4A 5G were already really good midrange phones, and rather than messing with a winning formula, Google has made some strategic tweaks to keep the 5A at the top of its class. Even better, the 5A costs $449 — $50 less than the 4A 5G’s introductory price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uVHzk2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10704989"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ePfjnI"&gt;The Pixel 5A is good, but it’s not exactly a slam dunk. There are a few drawbacks to note: its security support policy is good but not class-leading. It’s also weirdly missing software-level support for C-band 5G frequencies that US carriers will start using over the next few years. It’s only being released in the US and Japan, and even in the US it’s not being sold through the major carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU5k3Z"&gt;But all things considered, Google has managed to address some of the weak points in its previous A-series models while also bringing the price down. Not bad for a boring update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YY4e3eGvmohaCLt274ewkXE5ciY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781449/ajohnson_210813_4713_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5A’s screen is slightly bigger than the 4A 5G’s, at 6.34 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KXnfgn"&gt;Google Pixel 5A screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FSHisY"&gt;The Pixel 5A uses a 6.34-inch 1080p OLED screen, which is a bit bigger than the 6.2-inch screen on the 4A 5G. That’s not huge by any means, especially compared to the 6.5-inch-and-beyond panels that are common on budget Android phones. It also uses a standard 60Hz refresh rate, so you don’t get the smoother scrolling experience of faster 90 or 120Hz rates. That’s a feature that’s been steadily trickling down from the flagship class and is available in devices around the 5A’s price, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;’s 90Hz screen up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$500 Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;’s 120Hz panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3g8b52"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you don’t get the smoother scrolling experience of faster 90 or 120Hz rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mor8Ca"&gt;So the 5A’s screen isn’t a standout, but it is big enough that it doesn’t look quite as out of place next to the competition compared to the 4A and 4A 5G. It’s also just a good quality screen — the OLED technology delivers rich contrast, and it’s bright enough to be viewable outside in direct sun without too much effort. The same can’t be said of some of its competitors’ screens, big as they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsOr5p"&gt;There’s no change to the processing or memory specs from the 4A 5G: the Pixel 5A uses the same Snapdragon 765G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Apps open quickly, and I didn’t notice any significant delays or hiccups going about my daily tasks and social media scrolling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2azxqq"&gt;Complex image processing tasks are also carried out in a second or two, and that happens in the background so you can keep taking portrait mode photos without having to wait for every frame to finish processing. As someone who takes too many portrait mode photos of her cat in hopes of getting just the right shot, I truly appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WK1pFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heavy users should comfortably get a day out of the battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5hnWn"&gt;The jump in battery life compared to its predecessor is a bigger story for the Pixel 5A. It gets a 4,680mAh cell compared to the 4A 5G’s 3,885mAh. That’s much closer to the 5,000mAh batteries that are common among the competition. Google calls it “all day” performance, with up to 48 hours of stamina if you turn on extreme battery saver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMXlTs"&gt;I got better results in my real-world testing — a day of moderate use including around three hours of screentime typically drained it down to only 70 percent. Heavy users should comfortably get a day out of the battery, and if you’re a lighter user who spends more time on Wi-Fi, you can expect to get 48 hours even without battery saver enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRT6Cioy99RuDTQeSgk1t2zJ9Jc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781452/ajohnson_210813_4713_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of this year’s case options, “likely lime,” features bright green accents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uOHC5R"&gt;Google Pixel 5A IP rating and build quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CelYOt"&gt;The Pixel 5A includes an IP67 dust and waterproof rating, meaning it can be submerged in about three feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Official IP ratings are rare in the $500-and-under bracket outside of the Samsung A52 5G and iPhone SE, so this is one area where the 5A rises to the top of the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlGnl2"&gt;On the front panel there’s Gorilla Glass 6 for screen protection and underneath, the phone’s outer plastic shell is a metal unibody. The plastic panel features a matte finish that I appreciate — it’s less slippery than a glossy finish and doesn’t show smudges as easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjdv9d"&gt;There’s just one color option this year: black. You can spice things up with one of the colorful case options, which are designed for added protection against drops and bumps. Some are more neutral, like “black moss” and “maybe moon” (and also sound like Neko Case song titles?), but I opted for “likely lime” with my review unit and, reader, I do not like it. There’s a subtle 1990’s Nickelodeon vibe about it. Give me the fabric case back, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsDX3SyDEYXfF58kJLK4zYKEcXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781446/ajohnson_210813_4713_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At launch, the 5A is only available in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f16XWo"&gt;Google Pixel 5A software and 5G connectivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FgoLkh"&gt;The 5A ships with Android 11 and is backed by Google’s typical three-year OS and security update policy. That’s a longer shelf life than most budget phones, but Samsung recently started offering four years of security updates with its budget A-series devices, and Apple will offer its latest OS upgrade to the six-year-old iPhone 6S this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0is7E"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity on the Pixel 5A. It supports sub-6GHz 5G on all of the major US carriers, and unlike the 4A 5G, won’t be sold in a mmWave-compatible variant. Verizon insists on selling phones that can connect with its super-fast, hard-to-find mmWave 5G network so, like many other device manufacturers, Google came up with a more expensive version of the 4A 5G compatible with the network for Verizon’s retail shelves. That’s not happening this time around and nobody will miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PKkuru"&gt;&lt;q&gt;mmWave 5G is no great loss, but the 5A’s lack of C-band support at launch is more worrisome&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naBJWN"&gt;mmWave 5G is no great loss, but the 5A’s lack of C-band support at launch is more worrisome. C-band is the good mid-band stuff that carriers will gradually begin adding at the end of this year and over the next few years. The Pixel 5A has the hardware support and FCC certification to use C-band, but Google hasn’t enabled software-level support for these frequencies. It could add support in the future, but isn’t committing to doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4YlkP"&gt;There are numerous budget and midrange phones on sale right now that fully support C-band, starting as low as the $279 Galaxy A32, so it’s odd that Google won’t commit to supporting it. T-Mobile customers don’t need to worry as much since it won’t be relying much on C-band. But if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T and you plan to keep using your phone for the next two to three years, this could become a real drawback as those carriers enable C-band and (in theory) strengthen their 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYsXtUkyrZ9VBEPTlXHiaI1Ts34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781450/ajohnson_210813_4713_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel camera is still the low light champ of the budget class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YkYEJw"&gt;Google Pixel 5A camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cfk49Y"&gt;The 5A’s camera hardware is another place where it doesn’t look especially exciting on paper, but it adds up to much more than the sum of its specs. The 12.2-megapixel main rear camera includes optical image stabilization, which is hard to find under $500. This kind of lens-based stabilization helps ensure more of your shots are sharp, which is especially handy in dimmer light conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhMFB"&gt;That camera is accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and there’s an 8-megapixel selfie camera. This might not seem like much next to the triple- and quad- rear camera arrays on other phones, but those third and fourth cameras are usually low-quality macro and depth sensors that aren’t actually very useful anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VmbMsE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10704996"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mSQsTJ"&gt;If those specs sound familiar, that’s because it’s the same hardware as the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4A 5G, and that’s actually fine for this model. Even without new sensors or lenses, the 5A still offers the best photo quality in the midrange class, thanks largely of course to Google’s smart image processing. Plenty of the Pixel 5A’s competitors can take good photos in bright outdoor light, but Google is still the low light champion in the budget class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7GnfQ"&gt;Unsurprisingly, what was true of the 4A and 5’s image capabilities is also true of the 5A. It handles high contrast scenes well, and colors are rendered a bit more naturally than you’ll get from a Samsung phone. Portrait and night mode photos are among the best you can get from a midrange phone, though you can certainly spot their limitations with trickier subjects. Google has more work cut out for itself in equipping the Pixel 6 to stay competitive with the Samsung and Apple flagships of the world. In the budget class, it can afford to stand still for another year just because it got such a good running start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TamQFmgoPzsQwYDmuZj0BqSq-WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781448/ajohnson_210813_4713_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no wireless charging here, and the 5A will be the last Pixel sold with a charging brick in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nPFt5r"&gt;There are $400 and $500 phones with flashier standout features than the Google Pixel 5A. The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G features a big 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate. The TCL 20 Pro offers a flagship-esque curved display and wireless charging. The Motorola Moto G Stylus includes a huge display and (of course) a stylus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYSwnL"&gt;But the Pixel 5A is just a good all-arounder with a great UI, speedy software updates, and all of the basics covered at a reasonable price. The 4A 5G was already a good phone, and the 5A’s smart improvements like waterproofing and a bigger battery make it easier than ever to recommend this phone to a wide range of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VPsBq7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this is a very boring, very good phone that I think a lot of people would like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5gTI3"&gt;There’s the unfortunate case of C-band 5G and whether Google will add support for it in the future. It’s hard to imagine the company refusing to support it once the frequencies are in wide use, but we’re firm believers that you shouldn’t buy a gadget today based on a potential update tomorrow. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers should take that into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmMMP7"&gt;It’s a shame that the Pixel 5A will see such a limited release, both in terms of countries where it will be available and where it will (and won’t) be sold in the US, because it’s a phone I’d recommend to a lot of people. It exceeds the competition in a few ways, like its class-leading camera and waterproofing, and meets it in others, like its just-big-enough screen and improved battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OpKsT7"&gt;With its more limited availability, it seems likely to become an “if you know you know” kind of device rather than the phone you tell your uncle to buy when he asks you what to get with his two-year carrier upgrade deal. That’s too bad, because this is a very boring, very good phone that I think a lot of people would like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sDr8ho"&gt;Microsoft is hiring Manik Gupta, the former head of product at Uber, in a renewed effort to boost Microsoft’s consumer apps. Gupta will be responsible for Microsoft Teams consumer, Skype, and GroupMe, and he will report directly to Jeff Teper, Microsoft’s head of Microsoft 365 collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JsAr"&gt;Gupta spent four years at Uber running the various teams that contribute to the Uber app, and he also oversaw product management for Google Maps for seven years. While Gupta has a lot of experience in maps, that’s not why he’s joining Microsoft. The software giant appears to be keen to tap into his wealth of experience in consumer-focused apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2jGkq"&gt;“Manik’s experience... will be invaluable to us building world-class consumer experiences across all of Microsoft,” says Teper in an internal memo, obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Teper’s memo makes it clear that Microsoft has big ambitions for getting consumers into using Teams, and other opportunities to create communities or apps focused on consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has been trying to acquire consumer-focused services recently like Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5BHO8"&gt;Microsoft has been trying to acquire popular communities recently, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352309/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-deal-why-us-countries-data"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277845/microsoft-pinterest-acquisition-azure-cloud-services-rumors"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352028/microsoft-discord-acquisition-analysis-report"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;. While all three services are very different, they all share a common community element which, outside of Xbox, Microsoft lacks. Rivals like Google, Amazon, Facebook have all acquired big consumer apps like YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram, and Microsoft knows it needs something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYzMDm"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella seems focused on creators and communities, and how best to leverage the cloud to have a consumer-focused app or community. “Creation, creation, creation — the next 10 years is going to be as much about creation as it is about consumption and about the community around it, so it’s not creating alone,” said Nadella in an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/microsoft-ceo-hunts-anew-for-creator-hub-in-discord-after-tiktok-bid-fails"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21zCmp"&gt;It’s a shift that has been years in the making at Microsoft, after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16401898/microsoft-groove-music-pass-discontinued-spotify-partner"&gt;killed off its Groove Music service&lt;/a&gt;, gave up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;on Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542870/microsoft-kinect-dead-stop-manufacturing"&gt;discontinued Kinect&lt;/a&gt;, scrapped its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/3/13152590/microsoft-band-discontinued"&gt;Microsoft Band fitness device&lt;/a&gt;, and finally admitted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead"&gt;Windows Phone was dead&lt;/a&gt;. With the exception of Xbox, Microsoft has had a tough time with consumers, and Microsoft has been trying to alter that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594508/microsoft-consumer-push-2018"&gt;over the past few years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I52i_Ue6jRAMXrVlKsnoUDvaCFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/2361219/skypestock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future of Skype seems very Microsoft Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wuJfwb"&gt;In an internal memo today, Nadella makes it clear Microsoft is focused on consumer products again. “I want us to go after these new opportunities with both ambition and clarity of long-term product vision. Building new capability inside our organization to drive ‘consumer-grade’ product ethos will be key to our success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCSNeb"&gt;Although Teper’s memo doesn’t directly mention it, Gupta’s role means he’ll have to tackle the delicate balance of Teams for consumers, Skype, and GroupMe, and whether Microsoft will combine these services into a single effort or not. It increasingly looks like Microsoft is more focused on Teams than Skype for consumers, and it’s easy to forget that Microsoft still runs GroupMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLlwxI"&gt;Windows 11, which should arrive in October, includes Microsoft Teams integration in what Teper describes as “one of the most important milestones for us to delight users and grow our consumer business.” This type of Teams integration looks like an early hint at where Microsoft will focus most of its consumer efforts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDxCXd"&gt;Here’s the full internal memo from Jeff Teper, head of Microsoft 365 collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4FjiZ3"&gt;I am thrilled to announce that we have hired Manik Gupta, as Corporate Vice President for Teams Consumer, Skype, and GroupMe. Manik will report directly to me assuming general management leadership for our end-to-end consumer strategy, vision, and execution. Manik’s experience at Uber as Chief Product Officer, at Google as Director PM for Google Maps, and his current role as an investor and advisor to early-stage, high-growth technology companies, will be invaluable to us building world-class consumer experiences across all of Microsoft. Manik will officially start on August 30th and will be based in the Bay Area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7EcAd"&gt;Over the last few years, we have partnered across the company to grow Microsoft Teams to over a quarter billion users and the launch of Teams for Life in May is helping us connect many more people in their personal lives. But we have a much bigger opportunity ahead. I am energized by the increased progress and investment across Microsoft in our consumer experiences – Xbox, Microsoft 365, OneDrive, Edge, Bing, and much more. This fall Windows 11 – with Microsoft Teams – represents one of the most important milestones for us to delight users and grow our consumer business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAtw36"&gt;With Manik joining us to lead this, Rohit Wad will assume responsibility for engineering and will report to Manik as will Rohit’s PM reports. Rohit has been an outstanding driver of the launch of Teams for Life, Skype, and GroupMe and I am excited for him to take our experiences and engineering to the next level. Manik, Rohit, and team will partner across the entire Teams organization and the rest of Microsoft to grow our consumer services and make our products better for everyone across their whole lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>YouTube will show video chapters right in search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F62xFfzmePlBnSwjOGov7rho4FY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736466/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBGCdo"&gt;YouTube is announcing some new features for search to make it easier to find what you’re looking for amid the huge amount of content on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga5gBA"&gt;One helpful update is that YouTube will show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272095/youtube-chapters-feature-video-google-android-ios-desktop-mobile"&gt;video chapters&lt;/a&gt; right in search results, which should make it easier to jump to the exact part of a video that might be most helpful to you. Instead of having to tap into a video and scroll through the chapters just to find exactly the information that you’re looking for, you’ll be able to see the chapters from a search so you can navigate to certain spots in a video more easily. YouTube is also adding video previews to search results on mobile, meaning you can see a short clip of a video before you tap into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="48x0Ob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video previews are coming to mobile search results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14OB8H"&gt;Another change is designed to help people find videos if there isn’t any content about what they’re looking for in their local language. If that’s the case, YouTube will show videos with automatically translated captions, titles, and descriptions in search results. The videos that will show up, in this case, are in English to start, but the company plans to expand this to more languages in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPUzIP"&gt;And to further help people find information on YouTube, the company is experimenting with adding website links and “other formats” from Google Search to YouTube search results. This experiment is only available on mobile in India and Indonesia, but the company says it will “consider expanding” the feature to additional countries.&lt;/p&gt;
