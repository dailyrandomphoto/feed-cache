    <title>Democrats have a new plan to legalize marijuana federally</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1kAAwV"&gt;On Wednesday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) released a discussion draft of legislation that proposes sweeping reform to marijuana policy in the US. The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act would decriminalize marijuana federally, expunge federal non-violent cannabis convictions (and encourage states to do the same), and create “new grant programs to fund nonprofits that provide services to those adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNAmjv"&gt;In the introduction to the 30-page draft legislation, the senators note that adult use of cannabis is already legal in 18 states, Washington D.C., the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Medicinal marijuana is even more widespread, legal in 37 states, Puerto Rico, D.C., Guam, and the US Virgin Islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EbtUo7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;”a dynamic shift in public opinion and support”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a5RZmN"&gt;“These changes represent a dynamic shift in public opinion and support across the political spectrum,” the statement notes. “State-compliant cannabis businesses will finally be treated like other businesses and allowed access to essential financial services, like bank accounts and loans. Medical research will no longer be stifled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfChwJ"&gt;Despite recent state actions, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and subject to prosecution by federal agencies even in states where cannabis use is permitted. In practice, those prosecutions have been limited, but the risk of federal action has meant that marijuana businesses have limited options when it came to banking and many non-recreational uses of the plant have been stifled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlYpJD"&gt;The ambiguous legal status of marijuana in the US has also heightened racial inequalities in the justice system. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/a-tale-of-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-in-the-era-of-marijuana-reform/"&gt;2020 analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;, Black Americans were more than three times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession as white Americans. An &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-marijuana-arrest-legal/2020/09/15/65c20348-d01b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html"&gt;analysis by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year found that between 2015 and 2019, Black people accounted for 89 percent of the 3,631 marijuana arrests in Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjpAox"&gt;The proposed legislation addresses this directly with a number of restorative measures directed towards communities who suffered disproportionately from marijuana prohibitions. The proposal would expunge federal non-violent marijuana convictions and allow individuals currently serving time to petition for resentencing. The legislation would also create an ongoing fund directing revenue generated from federal cannabis taxes to “reinvest in the communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWirat"&gt;In addition, the proposed legislation would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="36Wo1M"&gt;establish a minimum age of 21 for cannabis retail sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qXIOAD"&gt;conduct an evaluation of the societal impact of legalization by states with adult use of cannabis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b0GM6h"&gt;introduce three grant programs to create opportunity for those harmed by the War on Drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T0Yize"&gt;expunge non-violent federal marijuana arrests and conviction, and encourage states to do the same. Those serving time in federal prison for non-violent marijuana crimes would be able to petition a court for resentencing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6ASNKR"&gt;provide funding to eligible states and localities for loan programs for small cannabis businesses owned by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cqT9an"&gt;impose an excise tax on cannabis products similar to those on alcohol and tobacco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gZaTmw"&gt;The legislation would also transfer jurisdiction over cannabis regulation from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). The FDA would have authority over manufacture and marketing of cannabis products, and the TTB would have regulatory authority over taxation of cannabis. And revenue generated by federal taxes would support restorative justice and public health and safety research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIDRFJ"&gt;The bill stops short of mandating legal status for cannabis across the United States. Under the proposed rule, state and local governments and Indian tribes would still be able to adopt and enforce rules and regulations over cannabis more stringent than the FDA requirements. The legislation would create a Cannabis Products Regulatory Advisory Committee, which the FDA would “convene and consult with before promulgating regulations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pw10Mm"&gt;The bill has not been formally introduced to Congress, and a final legislative draft is not expected until later this year. As described in the summary, the existing proposal is simply a discussion draft, “meant to spur a robust discussion among stakeholders” as the three sponsoring Senators finalize their proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ueyOZ"&gt;Still, the effort arrives at a moment of unique momentum for marijuana reform in the US. Voters approved new cannabis laws in four states in the November 2020 elections, and Democrats in the House &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/04/house-poised-to-vote-to-decriminalize-marijuana/"&gt;passed the MORE act in December&lt;/a&gt; which would have decriminalized cannabis and expunged criminal records of those convicted of marijuana-related crimes. President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"&gt;said during his campaign&lt;/a&gt; that he would seek to “reschedule cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts,” although Biden’s Justice Department has been slow to take action on the pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdsgFD"&gt;Concerned stakeholders are encouraged to submit comments to the Senate Finance Committee by September, using the email address &lt;a href="mailto:Cannabis_Reform@finance.senate.gov"&gt;Cannabis_Reform@finance.senate.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Retail stores are packed with unchecked facial recognition, civil rights organizations say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_NeFN0pdTvkvxwKZXa2ms2ANlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579594/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FQXGSy"&gt;More than 35 organizations are demanding top US retailers cease using facial recognition to identify shoppers and employees in their stores, which companies have used to deter theft and identify shoplifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7yrN9"&gt;The campaign is aptly named Ban Facial Recognition in Stores, and has &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/stores/"&gt;identified stores&lt;/a&gt; that have committed to not using facial recognition, like Walmart, Home Depot, and Target. It is now pressuring companies currently using the technology, or those who might use it in the future. Some companies that are currently using the technology, according to the website, include Apple, Lowe’s, Albertsons, Macy’s, and Ace Hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pse3ix"&gt;Companies that might use it in the future include McDonalds, Walgreens, and 7-Eleven. A &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/stores/"&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrNHbh"&gt;Privacy non-profit Fight for the Future organized the campaign last month as part of its larger Ban Facial Recognition project, and but has now garnered support from civil rights organizations like Mijente, Public Citizen, and Data for Black Lives, as well as others like the Consumer Federation of America and the Tor Project. Notably, facial recognition company &lt;a href="https://www.kairos.com/"&gt;Kairos&lt;/a&gt;, which touts itself as an ethical vendor of the tech, has also signed onto the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOJjZ7"&gt; Tawana Petty, the national organizing director at Data for Black Lives, explains in the campaign’s press release that Detroit has implemented Project Green Light, which places surveillance cameras with facial recognition in more than 700 businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9tUhA"&gt;“These cameras using facial recognition are monitored at real-time crime centers, police precincts, and on officers’ mobile devices 24/7,” she said. “It’s difficult to explain the psychological toll it takes on a community, knowing that your every move is being monitored by a racially biased algorithm with the power to yank your freedom away from you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHzNuQ"&gt;Retailers have used invasive technologies like products that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html"&gt;ping your phone’s Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/"&gt;then catalog its unique MAC address&lt;/a&gt;, but AI-powered upgrades to video surveillance systems have allowed features like facial recognition to be more accessible than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jBLam"&gt;For instance, Rite-Aid quietly installed facial recognition cameras in hundreds of US stores, mostly in non-white and lower-income neighborhoods, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-riteaid-software/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020. The cameras scanned shoppers’ faces to try and find people in the store who were previously suspected of criminal activity and then sent alerts to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STcx17"&gt;Walmart also reportedly used Clearview AI’s facial recognition more than 300 times, according to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and had &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2015/11/09/wal-mart-facial-recognition/"&gt;previously used&lt;/a&gt; the technology to try and catch shoplifters. Now, it seems to be taking a different approach by using AI to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48718198"&gt;find un-scanned goods&lt;/a&gt; in self-checkout kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUfNoO"&gt;Since these stores are private property, companies are not bound by &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/map/"&gt;state or local regulations&lt;/a&gt; banning government use of facial recognition which have been the most popular form of regulation. Only Portland, Oregon has &lt;a href="https://www.portland.gov/smart-city-pdx/news/2020/9/9/city-council-approves-ordinances-banning-use-face-recognition"&gt;included private businesses&lt;/a&gt; in a facial recognition ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiJr9"&gt;Fight for the Future also points out that the coronavirus pandemic has expanded the use of facial recognition-adjacent surveillance in stores, which includes software for customer counting and social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 rumors grow more certain ahead of September launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R_cuz9RQo2n8jjTrZyn1mDknaQU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579580/akrales_201018_4238_0531.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s iPhone 12 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mUXROz"&gt;Apple’s flagship 2021 iPhones will come in the same sizes as last year’s models, but with a smaller display notch, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/apple-seeks-up-to-20-increase-in-new-iphone-production-for-2021?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This mirrors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt; from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, this year’s phones will be an iterative upgrade over the iPhone 12 series, and will include incremental improvements to their processors, cameras, and displays when they’re announced in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5vKKZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports that “at least one” of the four new devices will include an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display. It’s a technology Apple has previously used with its smartwatches to dynamically adjust their screen refresh rates to conserve battery. That lines up with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;previous prediction from Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt;, who said that both Pro iPhones coming this year would include LTPO displays and 120Hz refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zSF0O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smaller notches, same screen sizes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bApJhD"&gt;The report also casts doubt on the possibility of seeing an iPhone with an in-display fingerprint sensor this year. Although &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple has tested the technology, it says it’s unlikely to appear in 2021. Way back in 2019, Kuo predicted that Apple’s 2021 iPhone models could be its first to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754520/iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-2021-iphones-face-id-biometric-security-rumors"&gt;feature in-display fingerprint sensors&lt;/a&gt;. The phones are also unlikely to include a fingerprint scanner in their power buttons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Kuo said in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGI02Y"&gt;Camera upgrades will reportedly include an improved optical zoom for video recording, according to the latest Bloomberg report. Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; the ultrawide cameras on both Pro models could also receive a boost this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9WNpe"&gt;One area &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t touch on is charging. There have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;been rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Apple might release an iPhone without any ports in 2021, and rely on MagSafe rather than a typical Lightning port for power. But recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;Kuo said&lt;/a&gt; Apple doesn’t think the MagSafe ecosystem is mature enough to act as the sole way of charging the iPhone, suggesting that the Lightning port is here to stay for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlidQu"&gt;Apple is reportedly gearing up for a big iPhone sales cycle. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it’s ordered up to 90 million units for the initial launch period that extends to the end of 2021, up from a typical order of 75 million seen in recent years. The company appears to be banking on increased demand brought on by more people upgrading to 5G devices, but it may also be set to benefit from sanctions placed on rival Huawei, which was recently forced to delay the launch of its latest flagship. Production of the new iPhones is unlikely to be hit by the global chip shortage because Apple’s size makes it one of chip manufacturer TSMC’s biggest and most important customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdIJ8l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNMIkd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 12 reverse wireless charging can power up Apple’s new MagSafe battery pack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MagSafe Battery Pack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzSMUwyaiCDk3V0izuImjIEnxnY=/0x0:1340x893/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578556/iphone_magsafe_packa.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WggYsJ"&gt;Apple surprised us Tuesday by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;simply putting its latest iPhone accessory on sale&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22576245%2Fiphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the first power cell we’ve seen that uses Apple’s new magnetic system to connect with the iPhone 12 family (Anker&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt; offers a 5,000mAh pack&lt;/a&gt; with slower 5W charging for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Portable-Anker-PowerCore/dp/B08TW7BRTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45.99&lt;/a&gt;), but it is the first one from Apple and can charge at up to 15W while it’s plugged in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUqB6d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-reverse-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-tidbits/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; point out a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; that helps answer a few questions we immediately had about the device, including confirmation that this will unlock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537855/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-reverse-wireless-charging-fcc-filings-hidden"&gt;the iPhone 12’s “secret” reverse charging feature&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B12%2Band%2B12%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F137669%3Fvgo_ee%3D3bheJeT%2FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F13%2F22576245%2Fiphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; didn’t spot any &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21532190/iphone-12-pro-ifixit-teardown-video"&gt;additional hardware&lt;/a&gt; to add wireless charging, FCC filings revealed the company’s plan to let you charge accessories while the iPhone 12 is plugged in and charging, complete with diagrams that now look very familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pmUNepKz-9I_dELMTRPWlEQhJ_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716068/image__4_.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUpxMe"&gt;As Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XPnozF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charge your MagSafe Battery Pack and your iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASsSk1"&gt;If both your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack need to be charged, you can charge them at the same time. Attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone and then plug the MagSafe Battery Pack into a power adapter. Using a 20W or higher power adapter, the MagSafe Battery Pack can charge your iPhone with up to 15W of charging power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8qV6R"&gt;You can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you’re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhXYqN"&gt;If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oy1UqO"&gt;Notably, reverse charging only works (so far) with this accessory, after an upcoming software update and only while the iPhone 12 is plugged in. Google’s Pixel 5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;can operate as a Qi pad while plugged in&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung devices&lt;/a&gt; have been charging anything you slap against them for a couple of years, but now Apple users can enjoy a similar feature. Will this newfound ability also charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, or anything else in the future? Apple isn’t saying (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wji9Nr"&gt;Also, in case you missed it, one image of the battery pack revealed its capacity specs: 1460mAh, 7.62V, 11.13Wh. We’ll need to do some testing to figure out exactly how much charging it can add in real life, but it’s worth remembering that in this case, watt-hours of charging is the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/watts-in-a-name-why-were-using-watt-hours-to-compare-batteries/"&gt;more important figure to focus on&lt;/a&gt;, as seen with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/16/18185283/apple-iphone-battery-case-size"&gt;Apple’s old non-magnetic battery cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space startup Momentus charged by SEC with misleading investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-STOCKS-POLITICS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAEdlPopFtGUPep2f1LdXC_9hcY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578469/1230842615.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQFpDb"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-124"&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt; embattled space infrastructure startup Momentus Space and its founder, Mikhail Kokorich, with allegedly misleading investors about its propulsion technology and downplaying regulators’ national security concerns associated with Kokorich, who is Russian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RITKLp"&gt;The SEC also charged the company, Stable Road Acquisition Corp, that was going to acquire Momentus as part of a deal to take the startup public (and sidestep the IPO process). Stable Road Acquisition Corp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, a company that exists only to buy another company; the CEO of Stable Road, Brian Kabot, and its sponsor SRC-NI have also been charged by the SEC. Everyone except Kokorich has settled the charges with the SEC and paid a fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ufpuRn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case illustrates risks inherent to SPAC transactions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SssIcY"&gt;Momentus, founded in 2017, aims to provide a “last-mile” transportation service for satellites already in orbit using a unique water-based propulsion system to drag satellites into other orbits. According to the SEC, Momentus wrongly told investors it had “successfully tested” its technology in space; in reality, the company had tested its tech in space once, and failed. Stable Road never reviewed the results of this test, according to the SEC, even though it claimed it had done “extensive due diligence.” Additionally, during that process, it didn’t get the documents needed to assess whether Kokorich was a national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR4jTC"&gt;“This case illustrates risks inherent to SPAC transactions, as those who stand to earn significant profits from a SPAC merger may conduct inadequate due diligence and mislead investors,” SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5Ytr4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Momentus paid $7 million to settle, Stable Road paid $1 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehs3py"&gt;Momentus paid $7 million to settle; Stable Road paid $1 million, and Kabot paid $40,000. If its proposed SPAC merger closes — expected in August, months later than its initial target for early 2021 — the SEC will mandate “tailored investor protection undertakings, and the SPAC sponsor’s forfeiture of founder’s shares,” the SEC statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTRHle"&gt;US authorities have been concerned that Momentus’ technology could end up in the hands of foreign adversaries, which triggered a lengthy investigation and delayed its plan to go public, because Kokrich is Russian. Kokorich &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1962211/momentus-ceo-mikhail-kokorich-resigns-before-spac-debut/"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; as CEO in January to sever the national security concerns from Momentus. The company’s projected value was cut in half, from $1.1 billion to just $566.6 million, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001781162/000121390021034741/fs42021a3_stableroadacq.htm"&gt;a revised amended registration statement&lt;/a&gt; Stable Road filed with the SEC last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ItxYn"&gt;Stable Road’s &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001781162/000121390021034741/fs42021a3_stableroadacq.htm"&gt;June filing&lt;/a&gt;, in which it slashed Momentus’ value, noted the company’s technology was still nascent, and that “the technology underlying its anticipated service offerings (including its water plasma propulsion technology) is still in the process of being developed and has not been fully tested or validated in space.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is capping Meet’s formerly unlimited group video calls to an hour for free accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/66C9_sYdpJ3fjTaNDILcpt3z5cQ=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578363/Google_Meet_1.max_2000x2000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cn0avv"&gt;Google has brought an end to its effectively “unlimited” group video calls in Meet for free Gmail accounts, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7317473?hl=en#zippy=%2Cparticipant-limits%2Cmeeting-length-limits"&gt;according to support pages&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/12/google-meet-group-limit/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now users with free accounts logging on to Meet will have group calls capped at an hour rather than the previous 24-hour meeting duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoFSlY"&gt;Google’s unlimited group meeting offer was helpful because so many traditionally in-person functions moved online due to COVID-19. Not having to worry about a call cutting out or creating new meeting links meant you could leave your video call on during long family get-togethers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jPw8I0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One-on-one calls are still unlimited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7vUYF"&gt;Meet was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;opened up to non-enterprise users in April&lt;/a&gt; last year to better compete with Zoom, and at the time Google promised to keep unlimited meetings in place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457293/google-meet-limit-meeting-free-plans-september-zoom"&gt;until September 30th, 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The company later extended that window into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;March of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and then again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359774/google-meet-unlimited-calls-free-users-june-30-60-minute-limit"&gt;until the end of June&lt;/a&gt;. Google still allows one-on-one calls to last as long as you need, but heading into the second pandemic summer, longer group calls will now cost extra — like a currently $7.99 per month subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575523/google-workspace-tier-us-brazil-canada-japan-mexico"&gt;Google’s Workspace Individual tier&lt;/a&gt; ($9.99 a month after January 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfnjZW"&gt;Like Google, Zoom’s one-on-one calls are unlimited and free, but group calls have been handled differently. Zoom has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176502/zoom-lifting-40-minute-meeting-limit-holidays-free-hanukkah-christmas-eve-new-years-kwanzaa"&gt;periodically expanded beyond its 40 minute meeting limit&lt;/a&gt; during specific holidays like Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHieWB"&gt;Meet, Zoom, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439924/microsoft-teams-personal-version-launch-available-download"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; all started out as business communications products that were adopted by non-business users in the early days of the pandemic. Now that some of the freebies are going away, it’ll be interesting to see which services people stick with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz’s new Roadster has a flippy touchscreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOwsfNijIe-diDHbrCQkkvFdGxo=/65x0:575x340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578271/mercedes_screen.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JvvaH4"&gt;Large touchscreens are commonplace in new cars these days, and the bigger these rectangular screens get, the fewer things you can do with the hardware to really differentiate from the competition. Perhaps that’s why, in the new 2022 AMG SL Roadster, Mercedes-Benz is taking the screen out of the dashboard, anchoring it to the center console, and letting it electronically flip up and down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHKUzn"&gt;That’s right, Mercedes-Benz’s newest car has a flippy screen. The company said it designed the 11.9-inch portrait touchscreen this way in order to help fight glare — the AMG SL Roadster is a convertible, after all — but it’s also clearly a flashy parlor trick that seems to say, “Hey, we did something different from Tesla.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wB9RXf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10650931"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alx7Ni"&gt;The new AMG SL Roadster also has a digital instrument cluster that’s a bit different from the rest. The 12.3-inch screen behind the steering wheel is tucked away in a “visor” that Mercedes-Benz says is “aviation-inspired.” Basically it’s a screen embedded even &lt;em&gt;deeper&lt;/em&gt; into the dashboard than normal which — of course — helps fight glare. (Something tells me there was a common theme in the most recent customer feedback sessions...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahGmJ0"&gt;The move to bigger screens in cars has put a big emphasis on software, which is why automakers from Polestar to Ford are turning to tech giants like Google for help. But similar to the current state of the smartphone market, the hardware has really converged. That’s paved the way for funky new ideas to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mga9u9"&gt;Much like, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Samsung’s folding phones&lt;/a&gt;, this articulating screen feels more like an idea thrown at a wall than something that will actually become desirable (I’m personally dying to know how well it stands up to being poked and prodded — it presumably won’t wobble, but you never know). But it’s an interesting risk for Mercedes-Benz to take nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook groups can now designate Group Experts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puOKdt8Sv4x4uq39YedOjHI96x0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69578066/acastro_180522_facebook_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TA3JHY"&gt;Facebook is introducing a new feature called “Group Experts” today, which will allow admins to designate which members are highly knowledgeable about the group’s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9SqGE"&gt;Beyond the bragging rights, Group Experts will have a badge next to their name emblazoned with the proof of their elevated status. This badge will show up on posts, comments, and in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/introducing-qa-engage-community/"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBIBFin5oH25zU2wawwz6npDFew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716164/fb_expertspiac.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TfyqeD"&gt;Group Experts will be selected by group administrators, and experts will only be given this extraordinary power once they have accepted the nomination. Admins can revoke the expert status, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOf2zm"&gt;Facebook is testing ways to make it easier for admins to find these experts, by prompting specific users, currently in the gaming and fitness spaces, to add which games or activities they’re knowledgeable about. Group admins can search these topics to find their new Group Experts. This tactic works as a growth driver for groups as well, since the new experts will be able to invite followers who have recently interacted with their main page to join the group too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH1adTSVlq4NXYjPw5ZwSYtggTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715780/CD21_430_NRP_New_Tools_to_Support_Experts_Badge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YJyeGM"&gt;However, if a group nominates an untrustworthy expert or if that group is willfully engaged in posting misinformation, it will exclusively be up to the admins to remove them from their expert status. For instance, groups that push anti-vax agendas would likely not nominate conventional doctors or public health officials as experts. So while the “expert” tag designates the trust of admins, it doesn’t objectively qualify someone as a real expert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph35DN"&gt;When asked about additional moderation tools to ensure Group Experts provide accurate information, a Facebook spokesperson listed the established ways the company deals with misinformation on the platform, like &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/how-it-works"&gt;third-party fact checkers&lt;/a&gt; and reducing distribution for content flagged as misleading. They added that members can always report content to group admins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo Switch’s Joy-Con drift problem, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzoVx2ujUuxfRfxN0iJGbLs_ovo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67590808/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QtpnJ2"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners have been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/cczxwz/i_know_its_been_said_a_billion_times_but_nintendo/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app"&gt;experiencing problems&lt;/a&gt; with the console’s removable Joy-Con controllers for years now, with users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/92oc0i/nintendo_needs_to_either_sort_out_joy_con_build/"&gt;reporting weird joystick drifting&lt;/a&gt; problems that cause false inputs and have been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/cayjls/nintendo_fix_your_controllers/"&gt;steadily growing over time&lt;/a&gt; as original Switch machines grow older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5NaS1"&gt;Ever since a &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/joy-con-drift-is-becoming-a-real-problem-on-the-switch-1836417809"&gt;report by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from July 2019 shined a light on the Joy-Con drift issue, Nintendo has changed its policies significantly. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty"&gt;The company will now repair drifting Joy-Con controllers for free&lt;/a&gt;, even if your controllers are outside the regular warranty. But Nintendo hasn’t changed the design of the controllers, and it’s still an issue today, even on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/7/10/20689379/nintendo-switch-update-fcc-change-cpu-nvidia-tegra-soc-nand"&gt;refreshed Switch models&lt;/a&gt; that launched last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUHvnm"&gt;If you’re looking for more information on the problem, here’s the current situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gdby1K"&gt;What is “Joy-Con drift”?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vm4JjL"&gt;Joy-Con drift is an issue that Switch owners have been encountering over the last few months that causes the analog sticks on the controllers to randomly move around and input commands to the console, even when they’re not being physically moved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wwL5N6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Phantom inputs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hx42ve"&gt;Anecdotally, the issue seems to affect left Joy-Con controllers (which tend to be used for movement in most games) more than the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/8tia7s/drifting_joystick_on_right_joycon/"&gt;right half&lt;/a&gt; of the controller set. Although, there are reports of users experiencing it on both joysticks. A quick (and extremely unscientific) poll of &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers revealed that some Switch owners have reported multiple controllers encountering the issue, while others have never experienced it, which seems to be mirrored by reports around the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R7iyMK"&gt;What causes Joy-Con drift?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EJelw3"&gt;There are two potential causes for drift: some users blame the issue on either dust or debris making their way into the controller underneath a rubber cap that’s designed to keep the interior clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9Mzpl"&gt;Others have &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/58bBc43#88PnO9v"&gt;completely disassembled the controller&lt;/a&gt; and found worn-down contacts, which might be causing the issue due to repetitive use. It’s also possible that neither of those theories is correct or that it’s a combination of factors that cause stick drift over time. Without Nintendo clarifying the situation, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/cfqp0a/for_joycon_drift_it_doesnt_make_any_sense_for_the/"&gt;it’s tough to tell&lt;/a&gt; exactly what’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NI65h3"&gt;How do I fix the issue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BNpxpb"&gt;As mentioned above, it’s not fully clear what’s causing the issue, which makes fixing it tricky. A possible solution is to make sure you’re running the latest Switch software or to &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22340/~/how-to-calibrate-the-controllers"&gt;recalibrate your analog sticks&lt;/a&gt; to make sure it’s not a software issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l79GZP"&gt;Some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/8tia7s/drifting_joystick_on_right_joycon/"&gt;have also tried&lt;/a&gt; using compressed air or isopropyl alcohol to fix the problem, although success seems to vary greatly. Others have taken the more drastic step of fully replacing the joystick entirely — a far more difficult fix that will void your warranty, if it works at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7vlguG"&gt;What is Nintendo doing about impacted controllers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OFZxmt"&gt;Following the outrage over the issue in July 2019, Nintendo has begun to fix impacted controllers free of charge. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xzzva/internal-nintendo-memo-instructs-customer-service-to-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Nintendo has directed its customer support team to fix Joy-Con controllers for free and issue refunds for previous repairs, even if you’re no longer under warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk47Zi"&gt;Nintendo now &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/ask/ht/789"&gt;even has a dedicated area of its support website&lt;/a&gt; for Joy-Con repair requests: just fill out the form and Nintendo will coordinate your return, confirm that the controllers have the issue, and either repair or replace the controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ1YHy"&gt;Otherwise, Nintendo offers a standard warranty of 90 days (for accessories, which seems to include separately purchased Joy-Con controllers) and 12 months (for consoles, which seems to include Joy-Con controllers that are included with a Switch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BV1lt6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo offers repairs, but they’re not cheap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mfUHPx"&gt;If you’re outside the warranty, Reddit users had previously &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/95ftyv/just_found_out_it_would_cost_40_with_shipping_to/"&gt;reported costs of $40 for an out-of-warranty repair&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the cost of a replacement single Joy-Con controller. (They run for $50 individually or $80 as a pair.) As of now, there haven’t been any announcements of an extended warranty for controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wlHIh"&gt;When the issue was first revealed, Nintendo commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pFEMb9"&gt;At Nintendo, we take great pride in creating quality products and we are continuously making improvements to them. We are aware of recent reports that some Joy-Con controllers are not responding correctly. We want our consumers to have fun with Nintendo Switch, and if anything falls short of this goal we always encourage them to visit &lt;a href="http://support.nintendo.com/"&gt;http://support.nintendo.com&lt;/a&gt; so we can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oFj3Cn"&gt;Is anyone suing Nintendo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FYyHLQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/cfbzi0/a_classaction_lawsuit_has_been_filed_against/"&gt;Back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner &amp;amp; Donaldson-Smith &lt;a href="https://chimicles.com/cskd-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-nintendo-of-america-inc-relating-to-joy-con-drifting-issues/"&gt;filed a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Nintendo, alleging that the Joy-Con controllers are defective due to the drift issues, and the firm is actively seeking more Switch owners to join the suit. That suit is still in progress, with the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/j3fu5w/nintendo_joycon_drift_class_action_lawsuit/"&gt;firm recently requesting&lt;/a&gt; that users send in videos of drift to help prove to Nintendo that the issue has caused problems for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRPNlC"&gt;Additionally, a second class action suit &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-joy-con-lawsuit/"&gt;has been filled in California&lt;/a&gt; over the same issue in October 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V7uBOg"&gt;Is drift a problem on the Switch Lite?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2EapNG"&gt;It’s unclear if the Switch Lite is as affected when it comes to controller stick drift — reports from across the internet vary, and there doesn’t seem to have been the same level of outcry (or a Nintendo replacement program) for the smaller Switch model. But the Switch Lite doesn’t have removable controllers, so if it does suffer from similar issues with stick drifting, the situation could be far worse. In that scenario, users won’t be able to swap out a controller to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nH7aht"&gt;Does the OLED Switch fix Joy-Con drift?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2FObzy"&gt;Nintendo refuses to confirm one way or the other if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;newly announced OLED Switch&lt;/a&gt; will feature design changes to fix Joy-Con drift more permanently, but it’s not looking good. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570868/nintendo-oled-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;In a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company said that “Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model),” while an FAQ posted to its UK website notes that “the Joy-Con controllers included with Nintendo Switch (OLED model) are the same as the controllers currently available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDBfGl"&gt;That all seems to indicate that the OLED Switch’s controllers are the same hardware as the existing Switch controllers, albeit in a new white color scheme. If that’s the case, then they’ll likely be susceptible to the same Joy-Con drift issues that existing models face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iGYuz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 24th, 2019: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added info Nintendo may be quietly fixing Joy-Cons with this issue for free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QTN53"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, October 6th, 2020: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added updated information on the current state of Joy-Con drift issues, Nintendo’s repair policy, and a new class action suit against the company. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNZVdK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, July 13th, 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information on the OLED Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google fined €500 million in France over bad faith negotiations with news outlets</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DfLsJs"&gt;Google is being charged with a historic &lt;a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/remuneration-des-droits-voisins-lautorite-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-500"&gt;€500 million ($589 million) fine from the French Competition Authority (FCA)&lt;/a&gt; for failing to comply with &lt;a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/droits-voisins-lautorite-fait-droit-aux-demandes-de-mesures-conservatoires"&gt;an April 2020 order&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate fairly with news publishers over the use of, and payment for, their articles and other content (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-500-million-euros-in-france-over-news-copyright-row.html"&gt;via CNBC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNE2hZ"&gt;News publishers gained the ability to request payment for the use of their content on third-party platforms with the passage of the European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18280726/europe-copyright-directive"&gt;controversial Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;, which was adopted by France in 2019 and generally tries to shift power toward content producers rather than the platforms that reshare their work. Article 11 of the directive, colloquially called the “Link Tax,” gives publishers the right to ask for payment for snippets of articles and other content linked in places like Google News.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4GpDH4DEsenQ_tlHnZS05W5LYN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13697407/Screen_Shot_2019_01_17_at_6.11.09_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s test search results it claimed it may use after the EU’s Copyright Directive was adopted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="madUjw"&gt;In the lead-up to the passage of the directive, &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/eu-copyright-directive-nearing-final-form-as-google-tests-stripped-down-news-serps-310494"&gt;Google tested blank content previews&lt;/a&gt; and no search descriptions as a kind of vague threat of what it might be forced to do in a post-Article 11 world. The FCA viewed that as &lt;a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/droits-voisins-lautorite-fait-droit-aux-demandes-de-mesures-conservatoires"&gt;an abuse of Google’s monopoly on search&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the company to comply with the rules and actually negotiate for the right to display articles. Apparently, those negotiations haven’t gone well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5lk7q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/remuneration-des-droits-voisins-lautorite-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-500"&gt;According to the FCA&lt;/a&gt;, Google forced its deals with publishers to be focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276544/google-news-showcase-uk-argentina-launch-license-paywall-content"&gt;News Showcase&lt;/a&gt;, a product that doesn’t encompass all the places publishers’ articles can appear across Google’s platforms. Secondly, the FCA claims the company isn’t willing to negotiate sharing revenue from the ads sold against other places publisher content might appear, like the links and search description you see when you pull up search results. Both issues were supposed to be addressed in the FCA’s big-picture order to negotiate “the remuneration due to [publishers] under the Neighbouring Rights Act for the resumption of their protected content,” but it seems Google didn’t see it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYkXpU"&gt;In response to news of the fine, Google tells CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it was actually about to finalize an agreement with the Agence France-Presse (AFP), France’s cooperative news wire organization, “that includes a global licensing agreement, as well as the remuneration of their Neighbouring Rights for their press publications.” It seems like this is more than just an issue of poor timing, but at least in this statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google is sticking to its guns — and claiming it doesn’t make much money from news search results in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hQKD41"&gt;While we are committed to complying with the Copyright Directive and the FCA’s orders, this fine ignores the significant efforts we have made to reach agreements and the reality of how news works on our platforms: Google last year generated less than 5 million Euros in revenue-not-profit from clicks on ads against possible news-related queries in France. We want to find a solution and reach definitive agreements but this fine is out of all proportion to the amount of money we make from news and we will be reviewing the decision in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="whelym"&gt;Google has two months to address the issues raised by the FCA by offering payments for the use of “protected content” to publishers. If it doesn’t, it faces an additional €900,00 ($1 million) per day in penalties on top of its already multimillion-dollar fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yniydp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
