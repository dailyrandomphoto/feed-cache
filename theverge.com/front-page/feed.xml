    <title>Genshin Impact’s creators have opened the door for commercial fanfiction writers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Genshin Impact" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/es6wYdrl_PVqtyetcfl4KLB01bs=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133775/50272117098_4902e671b7_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhKjjP"&gt;MiHoYo, the company behind the popular free-to-play game &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has given fanfiction writers the all-clear to create their own stories with the game’s characters or universe — even if they want to make money from their works (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-embraces-fan-creators-rather-than-suing-1847714438"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Commercialized fanfiction has &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction"&gt;long existed in a legal gray area&lt;/a&gt;, and MiHoYo making clear rules about how fans can sell it and physical merchandise is a big move for such a popular video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKW5VF"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/1372702"&gt;update to the rules for fan-made merchandise&lt;/a&gt;, posted on MiHoYo’s community site, the company said that “novels or stories written by fans” won’t need to be officially declared, “whether for profit or not.” That means that creators won't have to fill out any forms letting the company know they intend to profit off of stories written about &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ea2mwZ"&gt;Normally, writers working with popular franchises have to be very careful if they want to sell their work. While listing a physically bound version of your &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;story for sale online &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; won’t get you a cease-and-desist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311788/fanfiction-bookbinding-tiktok-diy-star-wars-harry-potter-twitter-fandom"&gt;some creators have acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that they’re relying on their small size to avoid being shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fm3QQV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Making fanfiction beautiful enough for a bookshelf","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311788/fanfiction-bookbinding-tiktok-diy-star-wars-harry-potter-twitter-fandom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hgvDu5"&gt;While the rules today create a bit of a gray area (does the word “novel” include printed books, or would those fall under physical merch?), it does seem clear that you could sell &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;-themed ebooks without any worries. With MiHoYo’s previous rules around merchandise, it was left unclear whether paid fanfiction of any kind counted as something you would need to seek advance permission from the company to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pikVuc"&gt;Fans selling physical merchandise at conventions or on sites like Etsy have often faced the same fears as fanfiction authors. For some of those people, MiHoYo is updating its policy to be even more lenient — individual fans selling items like T-shirts, cloth dolls, and fan art (but not statues or figurines) inspired by the game can now sell up to 500 units without having to apply for official authorization. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/381519"&gt;they were limited to selling 200 units without permission&lt;/a&gt;, which will remain the case for fan groups selling merch. In an FAQ section &lt;a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/1372702"&gt;of its post&lt;/a&gt;, the company also gives instructions on what to do if you end up going over the limit because you sold more units than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24BkTF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are limitations, but MiHoYo isn’t leaving it to fans to figure out what the company will and won’t allow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PBDwiH"&gt;Of course, there are still limitations on what you can do with &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;’s characters. MiHoYo says you can’t sell items that have actual screenshots from the game in it, you can’t act like the items you’re selling are officially licensed, and you’re not allowed to make anything that harms the reputation of the company or its game. Plus, if you are looking to get permission to sell hundreds of units, you can’t just ask to use all the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSWORs"&gt;While MiHoYo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warframe.com%2Ffan-merchandise-policy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22777194%2Fgenshin-impact-fanfiction-merchandise-rules-creators" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;isn’t the first company&lt;/a&gt; to allow creators to sell their stories and homemade merch, it’s rare that permission is provided so officially. The company isn’t ignoring its fans, letting them do what they want but without any assurances — it’s laying out a clear path for them to create their own work based on the company’s stories and characters. For those with a passion for the series, that’s good news; they can make and sell their own art without worry about getting in trouble for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Manchin blasts union-made EV tax break at Toyota event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rt6denjS1IO7OH8KalmGBGc4kTc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133766/FD7Q40MXsAMPykq.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Joe Manchin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NqLv4q"&gt; Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) wants to kill a $4,500 federal tax credit for union-made electric vehicles because &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/sen-joe-manchin-speaking-toyota-event-west-virginia-calls-union-built-ev-tax-credit"&gt;he thinks they’re “wrong” and “not American.”&lt;/a&gt; And he picked an awfully tone-deaf moment to say this: at an event hosted by Toyota celebrating a $240 million investment in its West Virginia facility, where he accepted three giant novelty checks for charity from the Japanese automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JaMSR"&gt;The $4,500 tax credit proposal would be in addition to the $7,500 federal tax credit that currently exists (and which the White House is trying to extend) for electric vehicles. It would only go to buyers of EVs that were made by a union workforce — meaning pretty much just the Detroit-based automakers. Toyota has &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/545022/toyota-ad-opposes-union-ev-tax-credit/"&gt;vehemently opposed the union-made tax credit&lt;/a&gt; along with Volkswagen and Honda. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-union-bill-tax-incentive-unionized-ev-makers-2021-9"&gt;spoken out against the idea&lt;/a&gt;. While the infrastructure bill is already on its way to President Biden’s desk to be signed, this particular tax credit proposal is part of the Build Back Better reconciliation bill that is still not finalized — so it could still change or be removed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WwPpbg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today I visited Toyota's Buffalo facility to see their new $240M hybrid transaxle line &amp;amp; to honor our Veterans &amp;amp; Gold Star Families. Toyota West Virginia has been a strong partner for 25 years &amp;amp; I thank them for their commitment to employing Veterans &amp;amp; supporting Veterans' orgs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/G1oHKNthU9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/G1oHKNthU9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sen_JoeManchin/status/1458833017036840966?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ylzeDd"&gt;As far as arguments go when it comes to Manchin, this one at least has a consistent logic to it. “The product should speak for itself,” he told &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re a capitalist economy that we are in society, then you let the product speak for itself, and hopefully, we’ll get that, that’ll be corrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIf2T1"&gt;It’s the &lt;em&gt;Veep&lt;/em&gt;-level optics that stand out, though. Yes, the checks were for charity. But knocking the proposal at the same event held by a major company that also stands opposed to it is almost as bad as explaining why you &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/joe-manchin-leans-over-deck-of-his-yacht-to-tell-protesters-why-hell-oppose-funding-healthcare-expansion/ar-AAP69ej"&gt;don’t support expanded healthcare from atop your yacht&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s pick for FDA chief works at Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Confirmation Hearing Held For FDA Commissioner Nominee Robert Califf" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OsC7UuS5HuEU1vA-2BLFvq6Lhg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133597/497506844.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JM51QQ"&gt;President Biden has selected Robert Califf as his pick for the next head of the Food and Drug Administration, the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/12/statement-from-president-joe-biden-announcing-his-intention-to-nominate-dr-robert-califf-for-commissioner-of-food-and-drugs/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today. Califf is currently a senior advisor for Verily Life Sciences and Google Health, two divisions of parent company Alphabet. He was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/alphabet-hires-robert-califf-ex-fda-commissioner-for-health-strategy.html"&gt;brought on in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to lead health strategy and policy for the groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0KlOL"&gt;Califf, a cardiologist, previously served as the FDA commissioner during the last year of the Obama administration. He also founded the Duke Clinical Research Institute, which runs clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzNI4x"&gt;“As the FDA considers many consequential decisions around vaccine approvals and more, it is mission critical that we have a steady, independent hand to guide the FDA,” Biden said in a statement. “I am confident Dr. Califf will ensure that the FDA continues its science and data drive decision-making.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvfrMp"&gt;But Califf’s relationships with pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Eli Lilly are already drawing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/12/fda-commissioner-robert-califf/"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; from consumer advocates, and they were an issue for a number of senators during his initial confirmation process in 2016. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted against his confirmation back then and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1459197346659676167"&gt;said in a statement today&lt;/a&gt; that he’ll oppose his nomination again, noting that Califf’s “significant ties to the pharmaceutical industry take us backward not forward.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZ4CFn"&gt;Califf’s ties to Alphabet could also be a conflict as the company pushes more aggressively into the healthcare space. Its health efforts include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534517/california-verily-testing-google-covid-inequity"&gt;Verily COVID-19 testing program&lt;/a&gt; (that fell flat and faced data privacy concerns), a Google tool to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;identify skin conditions&lt;/a&gt;, personal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379846/google-health-record-data-app-android"&gt;health records&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454817/google-hca-patient-data-healthcare-algorithms"&gt;machine learning projects&lt;/a&gt;. Alphabet relies on the FDA to clear medical features on smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436090/fitbit-sense-ekg-heart-fda-clearance-apple-samsung-withings"&gt;like Fitbits&lt;/a&gt; and a test wearable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18188910/alphabet-verily-health-ekg-feature-fda-clearance-clinical-research-google"&gt;from Verily&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fMs5J"&gt;Califf currently advises corporate leaders at Verily and Google Health about the clinical aspects of potential products, a spokesperson for Verily &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/12/fda-commissioner-robert-califf/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not yet clear if he would resign from those positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xiQFC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQtHDU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYdufE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel embraces the Sad Wolverine meme to announce X-Men ‘97, a new animated Disney Plus show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orNxSkakq9-68q8NpXF_sgy3nA4=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133595/FEAcf4dUcAET6lR.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoGJKG"&gt;The classic&lt;em&gt; X-Men: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; is getting a sequel series on Disney Plus in 2023: the newly announced &lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which “explores new stories in the iconic ‘90s timeline of the original series.” The announcement was made in the most fitting of fashions, of course: the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wolverine-crush"&gt;Sad Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;” meme from the original show. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LdkCbwHwm0WEFw73faODjFqwkJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23009308/FEAcf4dUcAET6lR.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m5DAsR"&gt;Beau DeMayo will be the head writer for the upcoming show, with original &lt;em&gt;X-Men: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; showrunners Eric and Julia Lewald and director Larry Houston &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/this-week-in-marvel-exclusive-interview-x-men-97-animated-series-hits-disney-plus/?linkId=139874009"&gt;set to help consult on the show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3Jg7r"&gt;Additionally, returning cast members Cal Dodd, Lenore Zann, George Buza, Alison Sealy-Smith, Chris Potter, Catherine Disher, Adrian Hough, and Christopher Britton will be part of X-Men ‘97, although &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/this-week-in-marvel-exclusive-interview-x-men-97-animated-series-hits-disney-plus/?linkId=139874009"&gt;Marvel’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; notes that while some of those actors will be reprising their roles, others will be voicing new characters. Jennifer Hale, Anniwaa Buachie, Ray Chase, Matthew Waterson, JP Karliak, Holly Chou, Jeff Bennett, and AJ LoCascio are also set to join the cast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz1B4p"&gt;The revival series isn’t set to debut for a few years (animation takes time!), although the original five-season run of &lt;em&gt;X-Men: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; is already available to watch on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Drz8Og"&gt;The upcoming series is also set to be produced by Marvel Studios, making it the first X-Men-related project from the group since Disney got the rights to the mutant superheroes in its acquisition of 20th Century Fox. However, given that &lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt; will continue the storylines from the original show, it seems unlikely that it’ll be part of the interconnected web of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, despite being produced by Marvel Studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyb1oE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt; will hit Disney Plus sometime in 2023, joining a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22541074"&gt;crowded list of other original Marvel shows&lt;/a&gt; that Disney announced at its Disney Plus Day presentation, including &lt;em&gt;Agatha: House of Harkness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Freshman Year&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2miKH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Friday November 12th, 12:28pm: &lt;/strong&gt;Added additional casting and production details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel reveals Disney Plus slate including Agatha: House of Harkness and Spider-Man: Freshman Year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOv6yY_Ho-wq-49dPdtv6Xr5wmQ=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133556/slack_imgs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dq2ed4"&gt;As part of its Disney Plus Day — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22540942"&gt;which included a number of new releases hitting the streaming service today&lt;/a&gt; — Marvel revealed a big slate of upcoming projects, some new, some previously announced. That includes the official title for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s Agatha spinoff, and a new Spider-Man animated series. Unfortunately there aren’t any new trailers, but instead a whole lot of logos. Here’s the full list, courtesy of Marvel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="500Y36"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Echo&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a series starring Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez, who will be introduced in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m87riT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt;: a series starring Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams, a genius inventor who creates the most advanced suit of armor since Iron Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t8FKGd"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Agatha: House of Harkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;a series starring Kathryn Hahn as her character from &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;. Jac Schaeffer returns as head writer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8cqrxt"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;: a series starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull Talos — characters who first met in &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;. The crossover comic event series showcases a faction of shape-shifting Skrulls who have been infiltrating Earth for years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2Aw9sw"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;: a special written and directed by &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; veteran James Gunn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NZSs1W"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;an animated series from Marvel Studios that explores new stories in the iconic ‘90s timeline of the original series. Beau DeMayo is head writer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0wElZu"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt; season 2:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the second season of the fan-favorite animated series. After enlisting the Guardians of the Multiverse to stop Infinity Ultron, The Watcher returns in season 2 of &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; to meet new heroes and explore more strange new worlds in the MCU’s ever-expanding Multiverse. Directed by Bryan Andrews with AC Bradley serving as head writer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O3pir3"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Freshman Year&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an animated series that follows Peter Parker on his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we’ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character’s early comic book roots. Jeff Trammell serves as head writer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MdScjq"&gt;Those who have a Disney Plus subscription can also catch a first look of three upcoming live-action series on the service via &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fmarvel-studios-2021-disney-day-special%2F6o3sloKePurL&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 14-minute-long special.&lt;/a&gt; Most notably, it includes first looks at &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight, She-Hulk, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, all of which are slated to debut in 2022, alongside a new &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02IzDR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt; is described as “a new globetrotting action-adventure series featuring a complex vigilante who suffers from dissociative identity disorder. The multiple identities who live inside him find themselves thrust into a deadly war of the gods against the backdrop of modern and ancient Egypt.” It stars Oscar Isaac. &lt;em&gt;She-Hulk&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, follows the titular “lawyer who specializes in superhuman-oriented legal cases” and will feature guest appearances from Mark Ruffalo and Tim Roth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iejgv"&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, here’s how Marvel explains it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MPToNU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;introduces Kamala Khan—a 16-year-old Pakistani American from Jersey City. An aspiring artist, an avid gamer and a voracious fan-fiction scribe, she is a huge fan of the Avengers—and one in particular, Captain Marvel. But Kamala has always struggled to find her place in the world—that is, until she gets super powers like the heroes she’s always looked up to. Iman Vellani stars as Kamala Khan aka Ms. Marvel. The series is written by Bisha K. Ali and episodes are directed by Adil El Arbi &amp;amp; Bilall Fallah, Meera Menon and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BEEDx0"&gt;While none of the teasers give much away, they — coupled with the rest of the lineup — do show that Marvel is continuing to utilize &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fsubscribe-now%3Fcid%3DDSS-Search-Google-71700000058993695-%26irclickid%3DRgfSZFzslxyIRHnyqjWYSydRUkGxmxXflxjQxI0%26irgwc%3D1%26cid%3DDSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-Vox%2520Media-564546%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3dBoDWJXrDVwzeR5APtVTarczQ4WhI6tkPIVtKwBlFRLhxMopaTyLMaAlj9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;subid1=VergeMarvelDisneyPlusTitles111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; as a key space for ongoing stories through 2022. The studio has already had some big hits with the likes of &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wandavision&lt;/em&gt;, and on November 24th a series will make its debut.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: How EV startup Rivian achieved a record-breaking IPO</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4dFljI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NJIBjo"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5095084519&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCtrBf"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter, along with managing editor Alex Cranz and senior reporter Sean O’Kane, discuss electric vehicle startup Rivian becoming a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. This leads to a discussion on how Rivian got to this point where other EV startups have failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CZR77J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;Rivian goes public in one of the biggest IPOs ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QP0FZb"&gt;There’s a whole lot more news covered on the show, especially from Apple. This week, we saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bBr0W9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;orders Apple to let developers add links and buttons to external payment options. &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SF89S9"&gt;And surprise! More news. Microsoft had a few announcements this week as well: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SZ5qiq"&gt;All of this and more were discussed on this week’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast. &lt;/em&gt;Listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full episode. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretlab really built its extra-small gamer chair that started as an April Fools’ joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2uI1vQpJBLMBNsaDpax1ziHPoI=/0x47:925x664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133055/Secretlab_TITAN_XXS_Main.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Secretlab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JQ0pTW"&gt;When it comes to gaming chairs, most of the focus is on how they can support and comfort your next 5,000 IQ play, but the fact is that most of them are designed to be large and imposing. After teasing a miniaturized version of its Titan chair &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/pages/xxxxxs?"&gt;as an April Fools’ joke&lt;/a&gt;, Secretlab decided to send it to production, creating this &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/pages/titan-xxs"&gt;Titan XXS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rU4C3B"&gt;The Titan Extra Extra Small has matching materials and even a five-year warranty just like the full-size chairs, and it even has height-adjustable armrests. It has child-locking casters and supports up to 70kg (~154lbs), so it should be safe enough for pets, kids, or anyone else who wants a small seat in front of the RGB keyboard and mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAW3bw"&gt;The chair will be available globally in “limited quantities,” so if you want this 1:2 scale version you may have to decide quickly on a preorder. A black hybrid leatherette version is available for $299 while opting for Plush Pink or Frost Blue fabric costs $319. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X minifridge&lt;/a&gt; went from joke to sold out in seconds, and now I’m wondering which non-serious product will be next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>TikTok tics are a symptom of a much bigger problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFxhtpm-fUbRetpHapH-VT3GLKo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132980/acastro_211111_4875_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Mental illness doesn’t work like measles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XSgKrq"&gt;Reports of teens developing tic-like behaviors after watching TikTok videos highlight something most of us don’t consider about mental health: symptoms can be social. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDCs5q"&gt;Since March 2020, specialists in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have seen a dramatic spike in young patients seeking treatment for tics, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teen-girls-are-developing-tics-doctors-say-tiktok-could-be-a-factor-11634389201?mod=tech_lead_pos12"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Doctors say most of the young people watched content from TikTok creators who say they have Tourette syndrome, one type of tic disorder. Top TikTokers film themselves involuntarily cursing, slapping themselves, making clapping sounds, and more. Cumulatively, #tourettes videos have been viewed more than 5 billion times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GphYFj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We learn in different cultural settings, even local settings, how to communicate our suffering.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXwMy"&gt;Some researchers have &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mdc3.13316"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; the sudden surge in TikTok tics is a “pandemic within a pandemic,” as the teens struggle with schoolwork, feelings of isolation, and even bruises and other physical marks from their tics. But TikTok isn’t &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the distress these teens feel, says pediatric psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/providers/allison-libby"&gt;Allison Libby&lt;/a&gt;, an associate clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Instead, the tics are a byproduct of anxiety, depression, and even traumatic stress. Far from dismissing these issues as “all in your head,” acknowledging how symptoms are shaped by a broader social context — and, now, by social media — could help teens find relief for more than just their tics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kWpeL"&gt;“Symptoms are a means of expression,” &lt;a href="https://anthropology.wustl.edu/people/rebecca-lester"&gt;Rebecca Lester&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of sociocultural anthropology at Washington University who studies psychiatry, religion, and gender, told me. “We learn in different cultural settings, even local settings, how to communicate our suffering.” That learning isn’t intentional — or even necessarily conscious. But the consequences can be debilitating.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE3LG0"&gt;Mental illness doesn’t work like measles, which manifests the same way wherever it goes. Because emotional experiences can vary dramatically across time and place, so can symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lyt5no"&gt;Take, for example, traumatic stress from war. Psychiatrists tend to treat World War I-era “shell shock” as a precursor to PTSD, a concept that was solidified in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. But the two groups of veterans often exhibited wildly different symptoms. Mutism, seizures, and paralysis were common symptoms of shell shock. PTSD, by contrast, is defined primarily by flashbacks. The further back in history you go, the stranger soldiers’ symptoms seem: in the Civil War, soldiers &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ptsd-civil-wars-hidden-legacy-180953652/"&gt;suffered from “nostalgia,”&lt;/a&gt; or homesickness, that made it difficult for them to breathe and unsettled their stomach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6uOYZ"&gt;There isn’t a “correct” stress response to war — or any other hardship. In every case, the soldiers’ suffering was very real. But their symptoms changed in part because their culture did. The plight of the TikTok teens suggests we’re in the middle of another revolution in the language of distress today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cySp8h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tics, in particular, happen to be very suggestible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kthyQD"&gt;Many symptoms have a social component, but tics, in particular, happen to be very suggestible, Libby says. In 2011, for example, as many as &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-students-twitcnew-york-h/schools-end-clears-up-new-york-students-mystery-twitching-idUSBRE85M0DF20120623"&gt;20 teenagers&lt;/a&gt; in upstate New York, almost all of them students in the same school, suddenly developed similar tremors. Explanations included environmental pollution and cancer clusters; Erin Brockovich &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html"&gt;sent a team&lt;/a&gt; to test local soil. Ultimately, doctors close to the patients &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; the physical symptoms were the result of psychic distress. Fortunately, by the next spring, many of the afflicted teens were on the road to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2C5ib"&gt;Just 10 years ago, teens were most directly influenced by the handful of kids in their homeroom; today, thanks to platforms like TikTok, the whole world can feel like one big high school. Earlier this year, German psychiatrist Kirsten Müller-Vahl and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awab316/6356504"&gt;introduced the phrase&lt;/a&gt; “mass social media-induced illness” to describe an outbreak of tic-like behaviors among German teens that began in 2019 and is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tourettes-youtube-jan-zimmermann"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a popular YouTube creator with Tourette syndrome. Add to that the COVID-19 pandemic, which more than &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/mental-health-and-substance-use-considerations-among-children-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt; of American high school students say has worsened their emotional health, and an outbreak of tics seems almost inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psohFX"&gt;So what happens next? The difference between true tic disorders, which typically emerge in childhood, and tic-like behaviors, which are what these TikTok users seem to be experiencing, doesn’t matter much for treatment, Libby says. Both groups will likely undergo something called comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics, or &lt;a href="https://tourette.org/research-medical/cbit-overview/"&gt;CBIT&lt;/a&gt;, to manage their symptoms. However, if there are other underlying mental health issues, those need to be treated, too. “My guess is that they will absolutely be able to recover,” Libby says, “especially if they are getting treatment for the underlying anxiety or depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uAVGqV"&gt;When it comes to the current spike in tic-like disorders, “blaming TikTok, it’s a cop-out,” Lester says. For these teens, the distress was probably already there. These symptoms just made it impossible to ignore.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Adi Robertson? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iqne-WDyMvKpmueZlSckvvFoW5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132974/arobertson_211031_4861_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A space to feel good working in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NYDUPB"&gt;When you have a tendency to collect stuff, it’s difficult to create a detritus-free space in which to work. It’s even harder when you have to do it on the fly because you’re suddenly working at home rather than in an office. Adi Robertson, senior reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has actually managed to do that, and in this chapter of “What’s on your desk,” she explains how she has organized a place in which she can concentrate and do her fabulous reporting without distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL9tw3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxFhFF"&gt;I joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; a few weeks after launch as a news writer; it was my first professional journalism (or writing in general) position after some low-key blogging and writing the cocktails column in my school newspaper. The great thing about my job is that I get to work across so many areas — I’ve covered film festivals, virtual reality hardware, net neutrality and copyright, speech moderation, obsolete tech, and too many random gadgets to count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvGtpb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is absolutely the neatest workspace I’ve seen yet. Is this new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qk26p"&gt;Extremely new. I spent the pandemic working at my dining room table until I cleared out a dedicated room — which I’m unbelievably lucky to have in a Brooklyn apartment — for a long-term home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J5jdL"&gt;To put it delicately, this looks nothing like the rest of my home. I’m trying to commit to having one neat space that I can feel good working in, and then… well, everything else. Which means I occasionally bring things (knitting, my mic stand) into the office and then shuffle them into the next room (let’s be honest, the dining room table, it’s not like I hold dinner parties) when I’m done with them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A corner of the room that’s best for Zoom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMZf1mB3rB5wnO9n36s3-dHLnRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007728/arobertson_211031_4861_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A corner of the room that’s best for Zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IytR8V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about your desk. Where is it located in the room, and where did you get it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItIQnD"&gt;I put my desk in the corner of the room that gives me the least trouble on camera for Zoom meetings and interviews. It’s against a wall that’s facing a window, opposite the only wall with no windows or doors, and far enough from my ancient radiator that I won’t scald myself in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeEuEm"&gt;The desk is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kardiel.com%2Furbane-55-writing-desk-walnut%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22774259%2Fadi-robertson-desk-tech-setup-writer-decor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;walnut Kardiel Urbane&lt;/a&gt; — minimalist so that I won’t feel tempted to fill it with stuff, but with a tiny drawer that’s perfect for spare cables, USB drives, and the recorder and earpiece microphone I use to capture interviews for transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWILNw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CHzioU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about your chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjIOwN"&gt;The chair is from &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeskItems111221/https://www.jossandmain.com/furniture/sb0/office-chairs-c1859034.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Joss &amp;amp; Main&lt;/a&gt;, although like every furniture brand I mention here, I had to ask my husband where he bought it. Left to my own devices, I am incapable of finding home goods anywhere except Ikea or the first random neighborhood store I walk into, so I acquire everything by vaguely describing what I want and always end up with something nicer than I’d have ever gotten for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJXXZJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you tell us about the tech that you’re using?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHnvMc"&gt;I spend the workday at my Vox laptop, a 2017 MacBook Pro, with a few accessories: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/6/1/17413728/the-best-usb-c-hub-for-laptops-macbook-pro"&gt;Satechi USB-C hub&lt;/a&gt; my colleague Chaim Gartenberg recommended, a pair of Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; that my &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; colleague Chris Welch reviewed, an Anker wireless charger for my Samsung Galaxy S10E, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer DeathAdder Elite&lt;/a&gt; wrapped up for the rare times I need an external mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zH05hm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h5F1WW"&gt;Sadly, I got the MacBook during Apple’s bad keyboard years, and I guess it couldn’t handle my typing volume and intensity. I’ve broken so many keys on butterfly keyboards that I gave up on getting them repaired and stacked a Bluetooth keyboard on my laptop with a cardboard separator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7VAvm"&gt;Outside work, I bought a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XQQTVS3?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; that I’d hoped I could turn into a &lt;a href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility"&gt;GalliumOS Linux machine&lt;/a&gt;, only to learn most newer Chromebooks don’t support full Linux installs. Turns out Chrome OS is almost shockingly convenient, but I still want actual control over my hardware. It really bothers me! I miss netbooks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU6uX5"&gt;There’s also an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeskItems111221&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F&amp;amp;LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 VR&lt;/a&gt; headset tucked by the desk legs. Like the Google Chromebook, there are some real privacy concerns here, but it’s such a well-designed product and Meta-Facebook-Oculus is very good at nabbing game exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DpInR1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7TlzMZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEkFPd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love your lamp. Where did you get it? And is that a duck or a goose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eakeNo"&gt;It’s a &lt;a href="https://westelm.e54b.net/c/482924/267856/4336?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westelm.com%2Fproducts%2Frachel-koslowski-mallard-duck-table-lamp-w1936%2F&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeskItems111221"&gt;mallard duck from West Elm&lt;/a&gt; — another thing I would never have bought and now find delightful to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYlqXb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you use a notebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgdGdV"&gt;I’m usually accidentally writing across two or three different notebooks during any given period, but I keep one ruled &lt;a href="https://www.muji.com/sg/products/list/Note%20B6"&gt;Muji B6&lt;/a&gt; at my desk for jotting interview notes and doing non-work writing and game design. (I love Muji pens, too, but I bought a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T401Y/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A16HZ3J3WEU71V&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lamy Safari fountain pen&lt;/a&gt; because I was constantly using up disposable ballpoints.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90DaWR"&gt;The B6 is a solid all-purpose size that fits in a purse very well, it feels respectable without being super expensive, and as a left-handed person, a spiral-bound notebook means there’s less paper to get in the way of my hand when I’m writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A Bluetooth keyboard was needed to replace a broken MacBook keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dgxnED"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of course, you’ve got to tell us about the typewriter!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbXBHT"&gt;I spend a bunch of my time outside work writing games and fiction for fun, and I like experimenting with the ways different tools influence the flow of it, although I usually end up using my laptop or notebook. (There’s a &lt;a href="https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-smart-typewriter-3rd-gen"&gt;Freewrite electronic typewriter&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/2/9080499/psion-series-5-vintage-pda-review"&gt;Psion Series 5&lt;/a&gt; PDA on the shelf behind me.) I’ll cop to this being kind of pretentious, but I think of it like a musician’s instrument collection — some tools let you go back and edit and others don’t, some make it harder or easier to see what you’ve already written, some are physically faster or slower to write on than others, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LNael"&gt;The typewriter is a manual Olympia I bought a decade ago off Craigslist and got tuned up by visiting a typewriter repair technician in an unmarked office at the top of a rickety elevator in Manhattan, because I had just moved to New York and was amazed that this was the kind of thing you could just up and do. It’s still got a couple of bent keys, but on the whole it works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMKbCJ"&gt;That said, trying to use a typewriter always makes me impressed that anybody wrote anything at all during their era. There’s such a precise rhythm to hitting the keys hard enough that they’re legible but not so fast they lock up against each other. And you’re so exposed! Anybody can just wander in and see exactly what you’re writing! Someday I will be confident enough to complete a story on a typewriter. Today is not that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The manual Olympia typewriter still works pretty well." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cJhnsT7q8bsoxHav9ZT4imwuyJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007732/arobertson_211031_4861_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The manual Olympia typewriter still works pretty well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iKbgF2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you planning to decorate your space any further, or are you going to keep it minimalist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yDwk1"&gt;I knew an early &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; video team member who kept a corkboard where he’d pin up all his badges from covering events, like a trophy / memory board, and I always thought it was a cool idea but never had the space to put one up. So I’ve got a decade’s worth of haphazardly collected film festival and tech conference badges stored in a box in my bedroom, and I want to finally put them on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpB7lX"&gt;Otherwise, I’m currently getting a Michael Tunk cutout collage based on &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; framed, and I’m hoping to put up a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; 10-year anniversary poster as well. But my general goal is to bring as little into the room as possible. Like a fortified redoubt against the clutter of my apartment. We’ll see if I can keep that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu6g73"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else about your workspace that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUKw1j"&gt;I have a minor update on the dried leaf at the edge of one of my photos. My cat Trico saw it moving outside the window the morning I took the pictures, and she got so excited that we brought it inside for her to play with. It’s on the floor now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0eXZTX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBHbY6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram Reels now have text-to-speech and voice effects just like TikTok </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZDKXIKTetEBuNHy1b2FeSTGDGXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132851/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5CncBi"&gt;Instagram has added text-to-speech and voice effects to its TikTok competitor Reels, two features TikTok has had for some time. The robotic voice-overs used as narration for videos grew so ubiquitous on TikTok in fact, that voice actor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435058/tiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech"&gt;Bev Standing sued the company in May&lt;/a&gt;, saying it didn’t have permission to use her voice. In September, TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701167/bev-standing-tiktok-lawsuit-settles-text-to-speech-voice"&gt;reached a settlement with Standing&lt;/a&gt; that included a licensing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07PDxQ"&gt;While it’s popular among TikTok creators, more importantly, text-to-speech is a widely used accessibility feature that allows blind people and those with low vision to hear spoken versions of written text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilzlba"&gt;To use text-to-speech in Reels, open the Instagram app and go to the Reels camera, record or upload a video, and add text to the video using its text tool. Tap the text bubble to get to the three-dot menu, and select “text-to-speech,” then choose which voice option you want. Then post the Reel as usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVckuW"&gt;If you want to add voice effects to your Reel, which lets you modify audio including a voice-over, after recording a Reel, tap the music note to open the audio mixer, tap “effects” and choose the voice effect you want. Options include “helium,” “giant,” and “robot.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7S5JqOKS6x9n954CS_RzJzndgWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23008827/voice_effect.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add voice effects to Instagram Reels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cEBF0C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels launched in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, meant to be a direct competitor to the wildly popular TikTok. Instagram launched a bonus program for creators in July, part of parent company Facebook’s (now Meta) plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; through 2022, and has offered creators with high follower counts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777899/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors"&gt;as much as $35,000 in bonuses to create Reels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cT5QHn"&gt;Meanwhile, TikTok has evolved its text-to-speech feature with &lt;a href="https://collider.com/scream-ghostface-tiktok-text-to-speech/"&gt;specialized character voices&lt;/a&gt;; on Friday it introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;text-to-speech voices from Disney characters&lt;/a&gt; including Stitch, Chewbacca, Rocket Raccoon, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
