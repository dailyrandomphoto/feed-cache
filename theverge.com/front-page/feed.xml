    <title>Activision exec asks employees to ‘consider the consequences’ of unionizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard Employees Hold Walkout In Support Of Labor Lawsuit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjWU7xZP7V7VePID0pOcP98N4pc=/0x0:8660x5773/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256486/1234272416.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s3GGvi"&gt;Brian Bulatao, former Trump admin and current chief administrative officer for Activision Blizzard, sent a letter to his colleagues that doesn’t outright discourage them from unionizing but also kind of discourages them from unionizing. The letter was sent after workers engaged in their fifth straight day of work stoppage in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;layoffs at Activision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826129/activision-blizzard-employees-create-strike-fund-while-taking-steps-toward-unionization"&gt;creation of a strike-fund&lt;/a&gt; to support those who walked out; and employees collaborating with the Communications Workers of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLulcx"&gt;The letter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1469355855707475970"&gt;shared on Twitter by Jessica Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, reaffirms in bold letters that Activision supports workers’ right to choose whether to join a union (as interference with unionizing is a violation of federal law). But, through carefully worded phrases, the letter also seems to discourage those same efforts by implying a union would impede progress by interfering in the direct communication between employees and management, a common anti-union talking point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUGumr"&gt;“We believe that direct dialogue between management and employees is essential to the success of Activision Blizzard,” Bulatao wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP7tq3"&gt;Direct dialogue like when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;over 1,000 Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove Bobby Kotick as CEO while the board of directors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;continued to essentially respond, “No.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k27k22"&gt;Direct dialogue like when breastfeeding workers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1468712916245368835?s=20"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; for years about the substandard conditions of their pumping rooms &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1468712965398405123?s=20"&gt;including having breastmilk stolen from their special fridges&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1468713229320740866?s=20"&gt;HR allegedly not doing enough to address those complaints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phxi8j"&gt;Y’know, that kind of direct dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cglelS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We believe that direct dialogue between management and employees is essential to the success of Activision Blizzard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aIhCHw"&gt;But according to Bulatao, the best way forward is “transparent dialogue between leaders and employees that we can act upon quickly.” As though the abuses the company is accused of didn’t occur over the course of years with some of the biggest offenders only being let &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;go as recently as 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnr7rd"&gt;The letter also attempts to warn employees off unions by characterizing them as faceless third parties to whom employees would consign away their rights without hope of input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="704V4s"&gt;“As you make this decision, we ask only that you take time to consider the consequence of your signature on the binding legal document presented to you by the CWA. [...] that means your ability to negotiate all your own working conditions will be turned over to the CWA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz6eYt"&gt;It’s true that unions are legal intercessors between employer and employee, but the “collective” in “collective bargaining unit” has always been composed of current employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5wvol"&gt;In addition to Bulatao’s letter, Julie Hodges, Activision Blizzard’s chief people officer, issued her own statement to managers about how to respond to questions they might be getting about unionization and training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NjEw1"&gt;Activision Blizzard did not respond in time for comment. The CWA criticized these anti-union adjacent tactics in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; saying, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PN92VW"&gt;“Instead of responding to their workers’ concerns, they’ve opted to blast the most tired anti-union talking points straight from the union busting script. Union avoidance campaigns waste resources that ABK management could otherwise be using to address the serious concerns at the company such as compensating the victims of sexual harassment and discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wEZ1fT"&gt;Activision Blizzard hasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/amazon-unions-virginia.html"&gt;gone full Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in its attempts to stop employees from unionizing. Bulatao’s letter said if Activision Blizzard fails to turn the company around, unionization would always be an option. But the letter gave no timeline of when such progress would be made. And as Activision Blizzard continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798473/activision-blizzard-board-of-directors-new-committee"&gt;create new committees&lt;/a&gt; and lean on “direct and transparent dialogue” that can be acted upon “quickly” to solve problems, employees like Christine — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823991/activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-victim-press-conference"&gt;who gave a press conference&lt;/a&gt; outlining how she was harassed and then retaliated against for reporting her harassment — continue to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXnIH7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Od1Ki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNnljk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton really wants you to know that what happened to Big isn’t because of its bike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelton Bike Plus in an apartment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkRYKZVuPbDEJ9vcXU8iyA6CLzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70256287/akrales210108_4344_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Peloton Bike was at the center of a shocking plot twist in HBO’s Sex and the City reboot.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5Wfps"&gt;The punches keep coming for Peloton. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;treadmills were recalled&lt;/a&gt; after a series of injuries and a child’s death, people are returning to gyms, and now — spoiler alert — its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/peloton-selloff-continues-as-sex-and-the-city-reboot-adds-to-image-issues.html"&gt;stock is down 11 percent overnight&lt;/a&gt; after its iconic Bike was a key part of a major character’s death in the inaugural episode of &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That...&lt;/em&gt;, HBO Max’s new &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/em&gt;reboot. However, Peloton is now saying its product isn’t to blame — it’s extravagant living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xe118I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler warning: the following discusses a major plot point from the first episode of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Just Like That...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLr6pV"&gt;The brouhaha centers around the death of Mr. Big (Chris Noth) following a 45-minute Peloton class led by fictional instructor Allegra (who is portrayed by actual Peloton instructor Jess King). Peloton has been quick to downplay the role its popular stationary bike played in Big’s demise. Instead, the company is pointing the finger at the character’s lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFyPLw"&gt;“I’m sure ‘SATC’ fans, like me, are saddened by the news that Mr. Big dies of a heart attack. Mr. Big lived what many would call an extravagant lifestyle — including cocktails, cigars, and big steaks — and was at serious risk as he had a previous cardiac event in Season 6. These lifestyle choices and perhaps even his family history, which often is a significant factor, were the likely cause of his death. Riding his Peloton Bike may have even helped delay his cardiac event,” Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist who also serves on Peloton’s &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/peloton-health-wellness-advisory-council/"&gt;health and wellness advisory council&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpHpF"&gt;“More than 80 percent of all cardiac-related deaths are preventable through lifestyle, diet and exercise modifications. And while 25 percent of heart attacks each year are in patients who already had one (like Mr. Big), even then they are very, very treatable,” Steinbaum said. She also noted that Peloton helps track heart rate — though you need a compatible heart rate monitor for that — to help riders exercise safely. Or, it’s &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; Mr. Big’s own fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jWQnQH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s unlikely that a fictional character’s death will be what does Peloton in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9WqTjI"&gt;Never mind the fact that Mr. Big is fictional — the product placement seemed odd given the jarring storyline. Companies generally have stipulations regarding how their products appear. Apple is notorious for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/26/21154151/apple-bad-guys-movies-iphones-product-placement"&gt;not allowing TV and movie villains to use their products&lt;/a&gt;. However, Peloton told &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/peloton-big-just-like-that-hbo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while it had approved King’s appearance in the show, it wasn’t aware of the overall plotline for confidentiality reasons. Peloton spokesperson Denise Kelly also clarified that HBO had bought its own Peloton Bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ezm4t"&gt;While SATC fans are &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a38474592/and-just-like-that-big-death-reactions/"&gt;reeling&lt;/a&gt; over Big’s death, and Peloton will likely spend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijof8uw4OHs"&gt;another holiday season as meme fodder&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not yet clear how much of an impact a fictional character’s death will have on the company’s long-term fortunes. The company was one of the biggest &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-smartwatches-workout-apps-and-connected-bikes-dom-1845926648"&gt;success stories of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, but that perception has begun to shift now that gyms are reopening. Despite slashing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22643715/peloton-bike-price-drop-q4-results-subscription-prices"&gt;cost of its original Bike&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton reported less-than-stellar earnings in November. Peloton’s stock plummeted 35 percent following the announcement, and the company also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/peloton-freezes-hiring-after-it-slashes-its-forecast-shares-drop-35percent.html"&gt;froze hiring across all its departments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Maa1PD"&gt;That said, if there’s one thing about Peloton fans, it’s that they’re incredibly loyal. The company boasts &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4e16bcc7-dd3b-40ec-acb6-840e691b40ee"&gt;a 92 percent yearly retention rate&lt;/a&gt;. A child’s death, several injuries, and a recall &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-recalls-treadmill-death-injuries-members-will-not-return-2021-5"&gt;were not enough to convince Tread Plus owners to return their machines&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unlikely that in the long run, a fictional character’s death will be what does Peloton in. However, the next few months will hint at what Peloton’s place is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror"&gt;in the future of connected fitness&lt;/a&gt; — and whether it’s still the leader of the pack. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is BTS’s Twitter world, and we are living in it</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVF86B"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1351897267666608129"&gt;most-liked tweet of 2021&lt;/a&gt; was a note from Joe Biden on the day of his inauguration. The fourth and fifth most-liked tweets are messages from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1351903613237547010"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/1351938078643003393"&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, also celebrating Biden’s inauguration. In second place, sandwiched right in there with 3.2 million likes, is a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1353536893787357184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1353536893787357184%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soompi.com%2Farticle%2F1503037wpp%2Ftwitter-reveals-btss-stopasianhate-tweet-was-most-retweeted-tweet-of-2021"&gt;photo of BTS member Jungkook&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a bed and making a kissy face at the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9oRlu"&gt;Such is the absolute chokehold that the South Korean band held over global social media in 2021. Twitter has detailed its top tweets, emojis, and hashtags of 2021 in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2021/2021--onlyontwitter"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and the running theme is clear: BTS ruled the platform. The members, who tweet from a single group account rather than individual handles, receive multiple millions of likes on almost everything they post. Their selfies are &lt;a href="https://www.iwmbuzz.com/music/celebrities-music/7-times-bts-kim-taehyung-and-park-jimin-broke-the-internet-with-their-crazy-selfie-looks/2021/10/10"&gt;regularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/02/btss-jimin-breaks-the-internet-once-again-after-posting-an-eye-catching-selfie"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelist.com/319552/bts-jungkook-reveals-a-brand-new-look-thats-turning-heads/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-besides-his-blonde-hair-jungkooks-bed-new-selca-caught-armys-attention-hilarious-reason-600265"&gt; “breaking the internet”&lt;/a&gt; and often cause their names to trend worldwide. #BTS, Twitter announced, was the top hashtag of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQtr1d"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/Jz9icVF68w"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Jz9icVF68w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 방탄소년단 (@BTS_twt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1353536893787357184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y9Ug39"&gt;The band is also responsible for the most-retweeted tweet of the year, which was a screenshotted statement condemning violence against Asians and Asian Americans. In the tweet, which followed a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/nyregion/asian-hate-crimes.html"&gt;rise in anti-Asian hate crimes&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, the members recalled their own encounters with racism and discrimination while also noting that “[our] own experiences are inconsequential compared to the events that have occurred over the past few weeks.” The tweet has received 1 million retweets and 2.5 million likes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1drJrs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopAsianHate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopAsianHate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopAAPIHate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopAAPIHate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/mOmttkOpOt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mOmttkOpOt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 방탄소년단 (@BTS_twt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt/status/1376712834269159425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt05fW"&gt;Third on the retweet ladder was Billboard’s August 2nd announcement that the group’s single Butter (currently nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category) had &lt;a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/1481985wpp/btss-butter-overtakes-olivia-rodrigos-record-on-billboards-hot-100-for-longest-running-no-1-song-of-2021"&gt;spent the longest period&lt;/a&gt; of time as number 1 on the Hot 100 chart in 2021, with 1.3 million retweets. (Second place was a tweet from Manchester United welcoming Cristiano Ronaldo to the team.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmrCmk"&gt;Twitter is hardly the only social media platform where BTS is topping lists. Band member V created his own Instagram handle just a few days ago and has reportedly become the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WORLDMUSICAWARD/status/1467863617697722375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1467863617697722375%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news18.com%2Fnews%2Fmovies%2Fbts-star-v-joins-instagram-breaks-records-and-becomes-fastest-to-score-10-million-followers-4527611.html"&gt;fastest user in history&lt;/a&gt; to reach 10 million followers. The group also snatched &lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2021/9/bts-and-their-23-records-enter-the-guinness-world-records-2022-hall-of-fame"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt; this year for most retweets on average, most viewed YouTube music video premiere, and fastest TikTok account to reach 1 million followers (among countless others). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVV48R"&gt;One thing is clear from all this: BTS — not just their publicists and social media managers, but the seven members themselves — are an online force of nature. They’ve mastered the internet. And in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359080/anti-asian-racism-attacks-surveillance-policing"&gt;a year &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"&gt;that’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22393622/asian-hate-crime-reporting-community-group-statistics"&gt;been incredibly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447553/anti-asian-american-hate-story-aapi-belong"&gt;painful and frustrating&lt;/a&gt; for many Asians and Asian Americans to watch unfold, it’s hard not to see each record-smashing post — whether a fiery political statement or a silly selfie — as a small comfort. This is a group that loudly condemns racism. It’s also a group that sings and tweets and comments in Korean. It’s a group that is Asian on the internet — unapologetic, kissy-faced, rising above it all, victorious. BTS isn’t going anywhere, and neither are we.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hdVMa7"&gt;New drone footage of a prototype Tesla Cybertruck being tested on the company’s track in Fremont, California, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1469353138893250570"&gt;was published Friday&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Elon Musk to address the vehicle’s hilariously oversized windshield wiper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHrQo2"&gt;The Cybertruck’s massive, flat windshield, blending seamlessly into the hood, was one of the electric truck’s most distinctive features when it was first unveiled in 2019. But keeping a clean windshield was something Tesla’s design team didn’t even consider, as evidenced by the original prototype’s lack of a working windshield wiper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1XlWi5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NkRT_y9zms?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VMxMhh"&gt;But now that the truck is getting closer to production, we’re starting to see the compromises that Tesla will have to make in order to accommodate the Cybertruck’s polarizing design — the need for an absolutely massive windshield wiper being one of them. And Musk, in his own fashion, is publicly airing his displeasure with those compromises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYPE83"&gt;“The wiper is what troubles me most,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1469371515430912004"&gt;Musk wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in response to comments about the wiper’s massive size. “No easy solution. Deployable wiper that stows in front trunk would be ideal, but complex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q9twf1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The wiper is what troubles me most”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z6nKaX"&gt;The Cybertruck, which isn’t scheduled to start shipping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;until 2022&lt;/a&gt;, is supposed to use “armor glass,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation"&gt;memorably failed during the onstage demo&lt;/a&gt; when Tesla’s lead designer Franz von Holzhausen smashed two of the vehicle’s windows onstage with a metal ball. The company is also working on something called an “electromagnetic” wiper that it plans on unveiling with the Cybertruck, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/06/tesla-futuristic-looking-electromagnetic-wiper/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6RgCx"&gt;Musk also noted that the side-view mirrors are required to be included by law, but “owners are allowed to modify their cars” after the fact. Whether that means replacing the side-view mirrors with mounted cameras, as seen in some concept vehicles, or taking them off altogether, we can’t say for sure. (Please don’t take off your side-view mirrors.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Et9hX0"&gt;The Cybertruck spotted on Tesla’s test track also featured a few other notable alterations from the original prototype, including a rounder, less-angular front end and a new set of headlights under the forward-facing light bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuakrF"&gt;Musk has promised to provide an update on Tesla’s product roadmap during the company’s next earnings call in January. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz fixes error that let drivers watch TV while in motion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KwMbIUtlk0naeSAOD1ppVWmSAM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255863/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0035.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmGuHZ"&gt;Mercedes-Benz has fixed a server issue that made it possible to browse the internet and watch TV on the 56-inch “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;hyperscreen&lt;/a&gt;” in the new electric EQS and newer S-Class sedans. While the oversight is already resolved, the German automaker filed for a recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in “an abundance of caution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG6JJB"&gt;The company says in &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V931-5554.PDF"&gt;a document filed with the NHTSA&lt;/a&gt; (which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/itskeithbarry/status/1469313981093453827"&gt;spotted by Consumer Reports’ Keith Barry&lt;/a&gt;) that, in November, it found an “incorrect configuration was available on Mercedes-Benz’s backend server and might have been installed on vehicles in the field.” Very few cars were affected (the EQS only just started hitting city streets here), around 227 by Mercedes-Benz’s count. The S-Class sedans made up a majority of that group. The company says it’s not aware of any crashes related to the error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7y2hiw"&gt;The recall comes at a time when more and more automakers have followed Tesla’s lead in adding massive touchscreens to the dashboards of their cars. Mercedes-Benz’s hyperscreen is one of the biggest available. It consists of three separate displays embedded in one glassy housing that spans the entire dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcOu97"&gt;This new focus on big screens — as well as the increase in the number of computer controllers throughout most modern vehicles — has made it easier for automakers to adjust a car’s functionality well after it’s sold, raising new questions about what should or shouldn’t justify a recall. It also comes just a few days after &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that Tesla quietly started allowing some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823127/tesla-car-arcade-games-safety-nhtsa"&gt;video games to be played while its cars are in motion&lt;/a&gt;, something it didn’t permit when it first launched the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddIsGE"&gt;Tesla has shown a little caution when it comes to issuing recalls for software updates, though. In November, it issued a recall for nearly 12,000 cars equipped with the “Full Self-Driving” beta software, after many of those drivers &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/42968/tesla-recalls-nearly-12000-cars-after-faulty-fsd-beta-update-causes-braking-glitch"&gt;started experiencing erratic braking&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla had already shipped an over-the-air software update meant to address the issue but still filed the recall with the NHTSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgbrXk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSAuxU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna data shows mRNA isn’t a quick fix for the flu vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tvnYj8MTRVTKMdX_2t8O4tZ6RVY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255851/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JgSW2t"&gt;The first data from clinical trials of Moderna’s mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine, released by the company Friday morning, were underwhelming — a finding that shows gene-based vaccines might not be a fix for all the problems with vaccine development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n180YK"&gt;The overwhelming success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech, supercharged interest in that strategy for developing shots. The shots inject people with tiny snippets of the gene for a virus, which the body builds and then uses to learn how to fight the virus. Current flu shots contain inactivated copies of the influenza virus. mRNA vaccines are faster to design and produce because manufacturers don’t have to grow copies of the virus, which is why experts have for years seen them as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562309/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-gene-based"&gt;future of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHf4Vc"&gt;Moderna launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566634/moderna-mrna-flu-vaccine-trial"&gt;clinical trial of an mRNA seasonal flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this summer, hoping to capture the same success as it did with its COVID-19 vaccine. Typically, seasonal flu shots are around 40 to 60 percent effective, and pharmaceutical companies want to make that better. Three other companies are also working on mRNA flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUZyIB"&gt;Moderna released its first results during an investor phone call and presented slides showing that the mRNA flu shots did generate antibodies — but the levels of those antibodies weren’t higher than those for other flu shots already on the market. They also had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewE_Dunn/status/1469305241195753473"&gt;more side effects&lt;/a&gt; than existing shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iILw83"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yep, looks like regular seasonal vaccines, but probably more reactogenicity. mRNA is not a silver bullet. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Jqq6saI1cD"&gt;https://t.co/Jqq6saI1cD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Florian Krammer (@florian_krammer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/florian_krammer/status/1469327805318107142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KnGlCv"&gt;The findings don’t necessarily mean that mRNA flu shots aren’t any better than what we have now. Because mRNA vaccines are faster to design and make, the shots don’t have to be developed as far in advance. Companies may not have to do as much guesswork around what strain of the flu to target them against each year because they can wait to make the shots until they see what strains are circulating. And as far as efficacy goes&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; there’s still a lot more data to collect: Moderna is preparing to conduct larger trials that would test how well the shots actually keep people from getting sick in the real world (not just testing antibody levels). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rh3sbt"&gt;Still, this early data shows that the immune system is tricky and that mRNA vaccines probably aren’t an easy shortcut for stopping a virus as persistent as the flu. More studies will be needed to figure out if there is a specific benefit to using mRNA vaccines to fight the flu, wrote chemist and writer Derek Lowe &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/moderna-s-mrna-flu-vaccine"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not a sure thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LsBkW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta adds Quest 2, Portal, and Ray-Ban Stories updates to its bug bounty program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dwZX5DPkdwX6uol7XwXDUbqR1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255450/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta added some hardware products to its bug bounty program | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkjjGN"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta is adding updates to its bug bounty program for products from its metaverse division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, including its Quest 2, Portal, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced Friday. The work will play an important role in its “journey to help build the metaverse,” according to a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgOMpR"&gt;The press release emphasized that verified Ray-Ban Stories bug submissions are eligible for awards, which it’s hoping will incentivize more researchers to “analyze the glasses and our other hardware devices.” The minimum award for discovering a bug is $500, and the amounts increase depending on the device and the potential impact of the bug discovered. The biggest payout listed is $30,000 but could go even higher at the company’s discretion, for bugs that could potentially result in health, safety, or privacy risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8elnxZ"&gt;Meta offered a list of hypothetical bugs and what the payouts could look like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r1KcJC"&gt;An issue that would allow a malicious third-party application to inject content that is then consumed by a first-party application, such as pictures to a slideshow or audio to a call, would receive a ~$1,000 payout under the “Issues caused by potentially malicious third-party apps”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYbAZi"&gt;A third-party app gaining microphone access without requesting it on a Quest device would receive a $5,000 payout under “Unauthorized mic access by third-party app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTLRtN"&gt;A third-party application on Quest that is able to crash or disable Guardian would receive a $3,000 payout under “DoS” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glLAF5"&gt;Remote code execution through a buffer overflow in the Quest voice chat library, getting execution in a privileged first-party application would receive a $16,000 payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cbdUFd"&gt;The company first established its bug bounty program in 2011 and says it’s been instrumental in helping it find and fix bugs, with nearly $2 million in awards paid to security researchers last year alone, according to a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from company security engineering manager Dan Gurfinkel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQZi4d"&gt;The complete list of payouts and guidelines can be &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/payout_guidelines/hardware"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla leak reveals all-in-one ‘Superhorn’ for Model 3 and Y</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model Y" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_Zi41MATnubH0myWOiKUX7Q8tY=/418x0:3582x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255430/0x0_Model_Y_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QdYCxi"&gt;Tesla may be adding new hardware components to its upcoming 2022 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles — including a new all-in-one “Superhorn” that combines a horn, alarm, and loudspeaker. This feature and more was revealed (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/08/tesla-model-3-y-new-features-changes-leak/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in a leaked document on German-speaking Tesla forum &lt;a href="https://tff-forum.de/t/model-3-model-y-technische-veraenderungen-und-details/100784/641"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dr1ErC"&gt;The listed component changes presented in the document appear to be meant for the eyes of European regulators. Tesla generally does not line up new features with model years as closely as most other manufacturers. For instance, the company started adding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet"&gt;new full self-driving computer&lt;/a&gt; (HW3) to cars in April 2019. Then, in September of that year, it began including an &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/10/tesla-pedestrian-warning-system-model-3/"&gt;external speaker&lt;/a&gt; under Model 3 bumpers (to comply with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13651106/electric-car-noise-nhtsa-rule-blind-pedestrian-safety"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; requiring electric vehicles to be equipped with a pedestrian warning system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTdi22"&gt;That external speaker add-in was a component of Tesla’s Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS), which emits sounds to warn nearby inattentive pedestrians (due to electric vehicles being relatively quiet compared to internal combustion engine vehicles). The company, known for its quirky novelties, later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199963/tesla-holiday-update-fart-sound-horn-goat-boombox"&gt;added new sounds&lt;/a&gt; that blast from the external speaker after honking the horn — including goat bleats and fart rips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2p_u_UPm9RaoJs7kxTw8fpQ-yjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078502/tesla_eu_add_ons.001.jpeg.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: TFF Forum user eivissa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked document also shows another LG battery variant for the Model 3 Performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rNcsg8"&gt;The new part is set to replace the current system, listed as “Superhorn (3-in-1 horn, alarm, speaker) AVAS version” — which alludes to simplifying the number of speaker parts the car uses. The component may contain a single speaker or a combination of speakers that can output the AVAS sounds, honk, and play the Sentry Mode alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xf4Vk"&gt;It could also discourage unsafe modifications — some electric vehicle owners prefer silence in motion and have disconnected pedestrian warning speakers, including owners of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHWT8VqnRGo"&gt;Nissan Leafs&lt;/a&gt; and some Teslas. With the new all-in-one AVAS speaker, disconnecting it could mean disabling the horn as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUkzjD"&gt;The list also reveals that the Model 3 and Model Y will toss their legacy lead-acid batteries aside for 15.5V lithium-ion versions (along with refreshed accessories like a new windshield pump compatible with the new voltage). Tesla already made a &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/02/02/tesla-model-s-x-get-rid-lead-acid-12v-battery-moves-li-ion/"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt; change to the new 2021 Model S and Model X. Other notable changes include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377981/tesla-radar-sensor-child-hot-car-fcc"&gt;new cabin radar&lt;/a&gt; and infrared camera for Model Y, laminated rear door windows, and a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;infotainment computer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="CHEoH3"&gt;A bipartisan group of US senators have announced a new bill that would require social media companies to share platform data with independent researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wOe2t"&gt;The bill was announced Thursday by Democratic senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and also Rob Portman (R-OH), a Republican. Named the &lt;a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/text_pata_117.pdf"&gt;Platform Accountability and Transparency Act&lt;/a&gt; (PATA), it would establish new rules compelling social media platforms to share data with “qualified researchers,” defined as university-affiliated researchers pursuing projects that have been approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NFS1wU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this legislation would provide a real pathway for researchers to better understand online harms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="245Gdr"&gt;Under the terms of the bill, platforms would be bound to comply with requests for data once research was approved by the NSF. Failing to provide data to a qualifying project would result in the platform losing the immunities provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzlpCu"&gt;“The PATA act is a truly comprehensive platform transparency proposal,” said Laura Edelson, a PhD candidate at NYU Tandon School of Engineering and lead researcher at NYU’s &lt;a href="https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/"&gt;Cybersecurity for Democracy&lt;/a&gt; project, in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If passed this legislation would provide a real pathway for researchers to better understand online harms and start coming up with solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJyqOS"&gt;Earlier this year, Edelson and other researchers at the NYU Ad Observatory project were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banned from Facebook&lt;/a&gt; after the platform alleged that their research violated terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsHsdQ"&gt;The PATA bill is the latest in a long line of proposed legislation aimed at peering into the black box of social media algorithms. The 2019 Filter Bubble Transparency Act &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20943634/senate-filter-bubble-transparency-act-algorithm-personalization-targeting-bill"&gt;took a swing at algorithmic content distribution&lt;/a&gt;, theoretically mandating that users be allowed to opt out of news feed and search personalization. In 2020, another bipartisan bill, the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency (PACT) Act, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302170/facebook-google-brian-schatz-john-thune-section-230-content-moderation"&gt;proposed amendments to Section 230&lt;/a&gt; as a means to hold platforms more accountable for content moderation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKGTil"&gt;While neither of those bills passed, the latest bill comes in a moment when social media companies in general, and Facebook in particular, come under increased scrutiny in the wake of testimony from whistleblower Frances Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2sMEz"&gt;While documents leaked by Haugen revealed extensive details about the inner workings of the company, some of the most damaging material was research showing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;that Facebook’s products could be harmful to children and teens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMIlc1"&gt;Earlier this week, Instagram head Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22816730/mosseri-testimony-instagram-senate-hearing-haugen-child-safety-facebook-meta"&gt;appeared before a Senate Commerce subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; to answer questions about whether the photo-sharing app was harmful to the mental health of young users. At that hearing, senators from both sides of the aisle expressed deep frustration at a perceived lack of action on longstanding safety issues from Instagram and its parent company, Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeG9Si"&gt;“Some of the big tech companies have said ‘Trust us’,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) to Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/08/1062576576/instagrams-ceo-adam-mosseri-hears-senators-brush-aside-his-promises-to-self-poli"&gt;per &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; reporting&lt;/a&gt;. “That seems to be what Instagram is saying in your testimony but self-policing depends on trust. The trust is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redditors are spamming Kellogg’s job portal to support striking workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kellogg Union Workers Continue Strike For Second Week" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TOC8zCO4KNTy061DEcsdAMJJscU=/0x0:2736x1824/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70255347/1236053125.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tutDQj"&gt;Reddit’s r/antiwork is typically filled with horror stories that make you want to quit not just your own job but strangers’ jobs, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXGqP"&gt;“My boss suggested I might not be able to take forty minutes to see my daughters [sic] first ever school play, so I told him try not to be a cartoon villain and he hung up on me,” reads one post from earlier this month. “That’s permission to take the whole afternoon off, right?” the post concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmqhU1"&gt;The underlying ethos of r/antiwork isn’t just to be a place to vent—it’s to push back on the idea of work as we know it. So it might seem counterintuitive that on Thursday, a thread blew up that was urging members to apply for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAIadk"&gt;The jobs in question are permanent positions at Kellogg’s cereal plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Tennessee. The goal was to overwhelm the system with fake applications, making it a nightmare for recruiters to sort through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NSacve"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s very easy to empathize with the Kellogg’s workers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbO5NB"&gt;Members of r/antiwork were aligning with the 1,400 Kellogg’s workers who went on strike more than two months ago over stalled union negotiations with the company. Kellogg’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062240467/kellogg-to-hire-replacements-for-striking-workers-who-rejected-a-proposed-contra"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; that it would hire permanent replacement workers after those on strike voted to reject a tentative agreement with management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBuBsn"&gt;“It’s very easy to empathize with the Kellogg’s workers,” says Kevin McKenzie, a moderator of r/antiwork. Hearing Kellogg’s workers talk about being overworked, being paid low wages, and having a poor work-life balance resonates with others, he says. “It lights a fire in the community, and you get ideas like this that spring up and get supported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1PHO2"&gt;Kellogg’s didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ermDn"&gt;Threads on r/antiwork compile timelines of the Kellogg strike, lists of products made by Kellogg to boycott, and links to the jobs that would replace striking workers. At the time of writing, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rcacru/apply_now_kellogg_is_hiring_scabs_online_lets/"&gt;the main thread&lt;/a&gt; encouraging subreddit members to flood the system with fake applications had more than 62,000 upvotes and thousands of comments. In another, members share tips on how to use features like autofill to submit applications faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSXtET"&gt;&lt;q&gt;r/antiwork has grown by 279% in membership between 2020 and 2021, now home to 1.3 million members&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0t7pp"&gt;The striking workers are aware of the efforts, says Corrina Christensen, director of communications for the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union, which represents the Kellogg’s employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyXRRD"&gt;“It’s phenomenal,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w58oGu"&gt;Earlier this week, Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-recap-2021-community-reflections"&gt;highlighted r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; as being “the poster child for the great resignation.” According to the company, the subreddit has grown by 279 percent in membership between 2020 and 2021, now home to 1.3 million members. The fourth most upvoted post of 2021 was a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q82vqk/quit_my_job_last_night_it_was_nice_to_be_home_to/"&gt;thread on r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; of someone unceremoniously quitting their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="et15Ov"&gt;Any organizing around flashpoints like the Kellogg’s strike is member-driven, says McKenzie. McKenzie is a graduate social work student in South Carolina who says the philosophy of antiwork resonates with him personally: he holds down multiple jobs and internships while in school, and at times, work has taken over his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRBZSj"&gt;“That’s why this kind of action gets popular,” McKenzie says. “Everybody feels the struggle, and the pain, and the misery that these Kellogg workers feel right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtRxzg"&gt;Moderators pinned a post with suggestions on how to support the strike, including flooding the job postings, but otherwise have let members take the lead. McKenzie says some members reported the job site crashing throughout the day, and the initiative has now spread to Twitter and TikTok, introducing new people to the r/antiwork community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7z8J7"&gt;It’s not the first time antiwork messages broke out of digital spaces. Last week, a slew of posts on social media suggested &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbb9d/hackers-are-spamming-businesses-receipt-printers-with-antiwork-manifestos"&gt;receipt printers&lt;/a&gt; were being hacked to spit out pro-worker manifestos, encouraging people to discuss wages with co-workers and form unions, eventually directing people to visit r/antiwork. McKenzie says the moderation team doesn’t know who’s responsible for the hacked printers — they originally thought the stunt was fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59AOD"&gt;Now some in the antiwork community see organizing around the Kellogg’s strike as an important way to turn their shared beliefs into real-world actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrrDV5"&gt;“It’s time for &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/"&gt;r/antiwork&lt;/a&gt; to make the news as a formidable fighter for the average worker,” one post reads. “I submitted four applications. How many did you submit?”&lt;/p&gt;
