    <title>Android ‘12.1’ could be a big foldable-focused update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8OdJ8SFn1epyOijRKkEriIgrxg=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919029/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A redesigned lock screen could make better use of horizontal space.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7yC0QO"&gt;Big foldable-focused improvements are on the way for Android, if leaked code &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;analyzed by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-v2-update/"&gt;Previous reports&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that this year’s Android 12 is going to be followed by a minor revision, which is expected to be called Android 12.1 based on previous naming conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QafWK8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis suggests this update may deliver a host of improvements for how the operating system handles large foldable-sized screens, including offering a better split-screen UI, a lockscreen that makes better use of horizontal space, and a new taskbar that makes it easier to use multiple apps at once. They’re helpful additions that should reduce the need for manufacturers like Samsung to build their own foldable-focused UI improvements on top of Android for their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbzYpIGNs8Nn9ZIr_ge74H-Qess=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884146/Android_12.1_dual_pane_notifications_1024x836.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viewing Android’s Quick Settings and notifications panel simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KwQpKQ"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;XDA’s&lt;/em&gt; analysis notes, most of the improvements relate to how the operating system makes better use of more horizontal screen real estate. For example, it allows the Quick Settings and notifications panels to be displayed simultaneously side-by-side (rather than one-at-a-time), while the lock screen can now be split to show the clock on one side and notifications on the other. When it comes time to enter a PIN or password, this can now be placed on the left or right of the display (rather than centered) to allow it to be entered with one hand on a foldable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElMCrV"&gt;Android 12.1 is also designed to make it easier to use apps in split-screen. There’s a new shortcut in the recent apps menu to open an app in split-screen mode, rather than having to long press an app’s icon. Meanwhile, a new taskbar on the bottom of the screen can also be used to open recent apps in split-screen mode by dragging and dropping them onto either half of the screen. &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;reports that it might eventually be possible to drag notifications to open their apps in split-screen mode. Finally, the Settings app also appears to be getting a new interface that allows top-level menu items to be displayed on the left, while its submenus open on the right half of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9udA6aBjhBIGRYXMDS327gGtFj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884143/Android_12.1_split_screen_UI_1024x836.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A taskbar with access to recent apps on the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="78Z92c"&gt;Other non-foldable focused enhancements include being able to tweak the amount of time you have to hold the power button to activate the Google Assistant, and making it easier for manufacturers other than Google to match their system colors to Android 12’s lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rvt3jl"&gt;Google is yet to officially announce anything resembling Android 12.1, nor has it even released Android 12 to the general public. That means the features detailed by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; could change a lot before they’re released, if they’re ever released at all. But combined with the persistent rumors about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Google releasing a foldable phone&lt;/a&gt; this year, it’s looking increasingly likely that we’ll see some of these features arrive sooner rather than later. Be sure to check out the full list of changes &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;over on &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s MX Keys Mini ditches the numpad for other useful keys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech MX Keys Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R_sVMwy530cGDgXNHtsv8GI2QjU=/0x0:1570x1047/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918951/mxkeysminihero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The function row has dedicated emoji, voice dictation and mic mute keys.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KNMukU"&gt;Logitech’s MX Keys Mini is a compact, platform-agnostic wireless keyboard that lacks the numpad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848369/logitech-mx-master-3-keys-best-mouse-even-better-magnetic-scroll-wheel"&gt;found on the standard MX Keys&lt;/a&gt;. It costs the same amount at $99.99 despite its smaller size, yet there might be enough additions to make this one the preferable option (you know, if spending $100 on a keyboard is feasible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUzvYT"&gt;Logitech added a dedicated emoji key to the top row of Mini’s function keys that lets you add some personality to your messages, in addition to a voice dictation key and a mic mute key that mutes on a system level, not per application. Joining them on the function row are media and volume keys, along with an option to adjust the brightness of the keyboard backlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bs0Lx1"&gt;The MX Keys Mini charges via USB-C and can flip between three Bluetooth devices via keys that easily let you switch. But something you should know about this model is that it doesn’t ship with Logitech’s unifying USB receiver, and it won’t work with one you might already have. It’s a Bluetooth-only affair, though it is compatible with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Flogi-bolt-usb-receiver.956-000007.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22687565%2Flogitech-mx-keys-mini-wireless-keyboard-features-price-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s new $14.99 Bolt USB receiver&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651973/logitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories"&gt;lowers latency and adds more security&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xpZxS"&gt;The MX Keys Mini shares a number of other features in common with the MX Keys. Its concave, matte-textured keys offer a pretty great typing experience. It also has backlighting that kicks on automatically when your hands appear over the keyboard, turning off a few seconds after you pull away. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech MX Keys Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cmk7VDnWl3lKimDdC04qg9-77Rs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873081/mxkeysminicolors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available in three colorways. The MX Keys Mini for Mac comes only in the leftmost grey and white option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RsHhnY"&gt;The default version of the MX Keys Mini shows both Windows and macOS commands, and it’s also compatible with Chrome OS, Linux, Android, iOS, and iPadOS. It comes in three colorways: rose, pale gray, and graphite. If you’re a dedicated Apple user who’d rather not have start and alt buttons, Logitech makes a version that’s just for macOS and other Apple products. It’s the same price, but it comes in just the pale grey colorway, which resembles Apple’s older desktop keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFe3cQ"&gt;Logitech claims that the MX Keys Mini can deliver up to 10 days of battery life with the backlighting turned on, as it is by default. Though, it can apparently last up to five months with the backlighting off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrzbZR"&gt;You certainly don’t need to spend $99.99 to get a decent wireless keyboard with scissor switches. But the price for the MX Keys Mini might be easier to justify if you use multiple devices at your setup, and especially if you use the MX Master or Anywhere mouse. When used alongside one of those, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/1/15715236/logitech-mx-master-2s-anywhere-mouse-flow-multiple-computer-support"&gt;Logitech’s Flow feature lets you move files between macOS and Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo confirms Donkey Kong area for Super Nintendo World</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHRAD0-F77hft53a0vF1sg4YBMA=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918843/snw.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WWLP5v"&gt;Nintendo has confirmed plans to expand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt;, its recently opened theme park at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, with a new Donkey Kong area. The news doesn’t exactly come as a surprise — construction already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605383/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-construction"&gt;appears to have been underway&lt;/a&gt; for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCxyF8"&gt;Imagery released by Nintendo confirms that, as speculated, the Donkey Kong zone will indeed be accessed through a large round door that already exists in the park, which is currently almost entirely Mario-themed. The zone will be a significant addition that increases Super Nintendo World’s overall size by about 70 percent, according to Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0aQPSk-j_qiw1-WHRnh5e0753Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884061/img_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A map showing the location of the new Donkey Kong area within Super Nintendo World.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="krXKGx"&gt;The Donkey Kong zone will include “a roller coaster, interactive experiences and themed merchandise and food,” Nintendo says in a &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210928.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Guests will be able to take a walk on the wild side through the lush jungles where Donkey Kong and his friends live.“ Nintendo goes on to describe the area as “a gamechanger that combines the innovative technology and globally popular approach to theme park entertainment of Universal with the creativity of Nintendo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Dx3JIu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Super Nintendo World is sensory overload","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Jm9G9V"&gt;“I am very happy to be able to make the world of Donkey Kong a reality following the world of Mario,” says Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto, who created the Donkey Kong and Mario characters. “I am looking forward to creating a thrilling Donkey Kong experience with the amazing team at Universal. It will take some time until it is completed, but it will be a unique area for not only people who are familiar with Donkey Kong games, but for all guests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvO60i"&gt;The new area is planned to open in 2024, at which point hopefully it’ll be actually possible to travel to Japan. Nintendo-themed areas are also in the works for the Orlando, Hollywood, and Singapore Universal Studios parks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump pushing Microsoft to buy TikTok was ‘strangest thing I’ve ever worked on,’ says Satya Nadella</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spA-QRAWrOpenYvKmDnYyZ76A5M=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918452/REC_ASA2_CODE21_20210927_182752_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella | Asa Mathat / Recode&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OA1OkF"&gt;It’s difficult to remember now, but in August 2020 there was a deeply surreal episode wherein &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21352004/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-trump-bytedance"&gt;Microsoft proposed acquiring some portion of TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354255/microsoft-tiktok-trump-ban-bytedance-china-us-canada"&gt;complicated deal&lt;/a&gt; as the Trump administration was threatening to come down hard on the platform. Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;TikTok turned Microsoft down&lt;/a&gt; just a day before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436035/tiktok-oracle-deal-bytedance-president-trump-safety"&gt;Oracle came in with an entirely different kind of deal&lt;/a&gt; and the whole thing dissipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6ckkA"&gt;Speaking today at &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;the Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the whole ordeal was the “strangest thing I’ve ever sort of worked on.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt9hI3"&gt;In terms of the value of such a deal for Microsoft, Nadella said he “was kind of intrigued by it,” before trying to move right along with a laugh, deadpanning after a pause “and then I guess the rest is history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24Gxlo"&gt;Kara Swisher pressed him for the story and Nadella, clearly still a little agog at the strangeness, walked through a few of the key steps. The important start is that “TikTok came to us, we didn’t come to TikTok,” he says. The company was looking for a US partner to help with “these security things we seem to [have been] hearing about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWygDQ"&gt;Nadella thought TikTok might have been a good fit because it was a social, cloud-based service that heavily leveraged AI, all areas of focus for the company. “It is an interesting product,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kBm2Ed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At this point I’m happy with what I have.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkGDsq"&gt;Nadella’s contention is that Microsoft would have been an interesting partner for TikTok because of its established work with “investments in social media, in particular what we’re doing in content moderation and child safety.” Those strengths — plus the key fact that it is a US-based cloud services provider — were seen to be key to assuaging the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N13v5w"&gt;“There was a period of time when I though the the [US government] had a particular set of requirements, [but] it just disappeared,” Nadella says. “President Trump I think had a particular point of view of what he was trying to get done ...and then just dropped off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdT3pT"&gt;TikTok ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;let Microsoft know&lt;/a&gt; that it wouldn’t be moving forward with the deal in September. Later in the year, days ahead of a deadline Trump set for parent company ByteDance to sell off its US assets, TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the administration had forgotten about the ban altogether. President Biden ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the order this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEcr9B"&gt;“At this point, it’s all moot, right?” Nadella says. He says he hasn’t followed up on what’s going on with TikTok and Oracle. (Hint: it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;shelved indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;.) Would he like to buy TikTok now if it came back on the table? “No,” Nadella says, “at this point I’m happy with what I have.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD CEO Lisa Su downplays the company’s role in crypto mining</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7CQVLAXs7UW96NQ-GHbqJFfL3uU=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917968/i_qpTsNNv_XL.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD CEO Lisa Su at Code Conference 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Asa Mathat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IVIbwI"&gt;Can’t get a new graphics card for your PC? You might be tempted to blame &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372721/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-midnight-black-ebay-scalpers"&gt;bots, scalpers&lt;/a&gt; or cryptocurrency miners for that — but AMD CEO Lisa Su is downplaying the impact of crypto at the &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; today. When asked about how big a deal crypto is for the chipmaker, she told the audience that it’s a rather small part of AMD’s business, called it “a pretty volatile space,” and suggested that it shouldn’t be a focus for AMD going forward either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wf2klE"&gt;That’s not a particularly surprising stance for several reasons. First, what upside there was for GPU makers like AMD and Nvidia has drastically shrunk — GPU prices have slowly been dropping amidst &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading'"&gt;China’s cryptocurrency crackdown&lt;/a&gt;, which only got stronger this past week as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691472/china-central-bank-cryptocurrency-illegal-bitcoin"&gt;China’s central bank officially banned cryptocurrency transactions entirely&lt;/a&gt;. There have been reports of mass GPU sell-offs from mining regions going back months, although prices are still quite high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9tMyZS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A few reasons why Su isn’t going to boost crypto right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XNFTH"&gt;Second, if she were to publicly say she supports AMD chasing crypto sales, that could be a really unpopular look when it comes to AMD’s hyper-vocal audience of gamers who believe that every sale to a crypto miner is a sale at their expense — and who also drive purchases of desktop CPUs and motherboards for AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNbU5L"&gt;Su made it very clear in her reply at the Code Conference that gamers are top of mind: “We are trying really hard to get more products to gamers; I get so many ‘Dear Lisa, can you help me get a gaming card?’” she said. AMD already took some flak from gamers when it revealed &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-cryptocurrency-mining-limiter-ethereum/"&gt;it wouldn’t block mining workloads with its new GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. “At the end of the day we’re building for sort of consumer applications, and that’s where the focus is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OB4r5F"&gt;But third, AMD may just not have a large enough supply of GPUs to tempt miners to begin with. While we don’t know how many current-gen GPUs the company has actually shipped, there are many signs that the company has sold precious few of them compared to its rival Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4q0gZ"&gt;It’s far rarer to see an AMD GPU in stock, there are far fewer of them changing hands on sites like eBay, and not even one AMD GPU has broken into &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam"&gt;Steam’s Hardware Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a rough glimpse at how many of them have made it into PC gamers’ hands. Over 6 percent of gaming PCs included in the survey have one of the Nvidia 3000-series GPUs, but there isn’t a single recent AMD GPU on the list, which suggests none of them have accumulated more than a 0.15 percent share of Steam gamers. When Su says that crypto is “not a large piece of our business,” it’s possible she also means that new desktop GPUs are not a large piece of AMD’s business. Su did say in May that AMD was having to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;prioritize some components over others&lt;/a&gt;, though she didn’t mention GPUs specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGrFZh"&gt;Speaking of shortages, Su also addressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;the ongoing global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; onstage, reiterating that supplies will be “tight” this year and “likely tight” the first half of next year, but that “it’ll get better in 2022” as additional production capacity comes online. “It gets better next year, not immediately, but it’ll gradually get better as more plants come up,” she told the attendees at Code Conference. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reveals plans for massive EV and battery factories in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_1p2Qfrx3kXJS0GvzZusuxV5f4=/169x0:1992x1215/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917844/Blue_Oval_City_16x9_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3RuXOV"&gt;Ford and South Korean battery manufacturer SK Innovation will spend a combined $11.4 billion to build several new factories in the Tennessee and Kentucky focused on the development and production of electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbjnJ8"&gt;The new facilities represent the first new plants built by Ford, completely from scratch, in over 50 years. The Tennessee plant will be a “mega campus” that houses a vehicle-production facility for Ford’s F-series pickup trucks and a battery assembly division, while the twin factories in Kentucky will manufacture lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuZiSQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is show, not tell time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4moH0o"&gt;The facilities won’t come online until 2025, but Ford CEO Jim Farley says the investment signals the seriousness with which the company is taking its commitment to EVs. The new campus in Stanton, Tennessee, for example, will cover nine square miles and represents the largest facility ever built in the company’s 118-year history, Farley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLkwy9"&gt;“This is a new Ford,” Farley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is show, not tell time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U700BY"&gt;Ford, like the rest of the auto industry, is scrambling to shift its attention to EVs, even as they only represent a small fraction of vehicles sold every year. The announcement comes as Congress is debating whether to approve an infrastructure deal that would fund the construction of hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;new charging stations&lt;/a&gt;, as well as new consumer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669809/honda-toyota-criticize-democrats-proposed-tax-credit-union-made-electric-vehicles"&gt;incentives for EV sales&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes as the auto industry grapples with new proposals banning the sale of gas cars in foreign markets and some US states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;like California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFXtiQI_3ADfeQocD71ITegXtAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280373/sokane_210125_4386_1765.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv7myT"&gt;Farley made the analogy that electric cars are now at a similar place as smartphones in 2007. “This story ... is not about propulsion,” Farley said. “This story is about digital vehicles with embedded systems, and a customer experience led through software that gets better every day, and changes the definition of a car from something that gets you from point A to point B, to something that enables your full life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCUbE1"&gt;The new facilities represent a shift in Ford’s approach to EV manufacturing. It’s a more financially risky move with potentially lucrative rewards in the future if the company can successfully supplement production from its own suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neDRMO"&gt;Ford currently sources its batteries from SK Innovation, which recently lost a trade secret dispute with rival LG Chem that could hinder its imports to the US. (The companies &lt;a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ford-vw-battery-supplier-sk-innovation-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban-11618073730550.html"&gt;recently reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; that could avert a possible import ban.) By making its own batteries in the US, Ford can avoid some of the conflicts that arise from sourcing batteries overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="poQtW3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford CEO Jim Farley on building the electric F-150 — and reinventing Ford","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2TNO85"&gt;Farley estimates that Ford will need 140GWh of battery manufacturing capacity a year, and in total, the company’s three new battery plants will enable 129 gigawatt-hours (GWh) a year of production capacity. By comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is planning four new battery factories in the US with partner LG Chem for a total annual capacity of 140GWh, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to have six battery cell production plants operating in Europe by 2030 for a total of 240GWh a year. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;battery factory in Berlin&lt;/a&gt; would produce 250GWh — roughly equivalent to the current world battery cell production capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXnmC1"&gt;Globally, battery production is expected to grow from 95.3GWh in 2020 to 410.5GWh in 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XD5QQy"&gt;Farley said Ford’s contribution to the massive investments in battery capacity will be significant because of its status as maker of the F-150 pickup truck, which has been the most popular vehicle in the US for decades. “This is different than Tesla and the other announcements [because] this is enormous scale,” he said. “America’s best selling vehicles going electric. We’re totally sold out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPKQbe"&gt;Ford says it will spend $7 billion, while SK Innovation will contribute $4.4 billion, for a total of $11.4 billion. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;Ford has said it would spend $30 billion by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and that 40 percent of its global fleet will be electric by 2030. The company is currently at work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441276/ford-electric-f150-truck-factory-break-ground-michigan"&gt;retrofitting its historic Rouge factory&lt;/a&gt; for the production of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J8rIdrRYw_IerpqoGmL_ksutCeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882601/Blue_Oval_City_05.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Oval City will cost $5.6 billion and generate 6,000 new jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AFGtBE"&gt;The “mega campus” in Stanton, Tennessee, will be called Blue Oval City. At a cost of $5.6 billion, the facility will generate approximately 6,000 new jobs, Ford says. Blue Oval City will become a “vertically integrated ecosystem” for Ford’s assembly of an expanded lineup of electric F-series vehicles. It will also include a battery plant, key suppliers, and recycling. (Ford recently struck a deal with Redwood Materials, a battery recycler founded by a former top executive from Tesla.) Ford said that Blue Oval City is also designed to be carbon neutral with “zero waste to landfill” once fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="521erF"&gt;In central Kentucky, Ford plans to build a “dedicated battery manufacturing complex” with SK Innovation. Dubbed the BlueOvalSK Battery Park, the complex will cost $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs. Batteries for the company’s next-generation Ford and Lincoln EVs will be assembled at the site’s twin battery plants. The construction money will flow from a new joint venture called BlueOvalSK (which is still subject to “regulatory approvals and other conditions,” Ford says).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeYkWP0Kg17vmqqMYon9LGeBdrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882602/BlueOvalSK_Battery_Park_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlueOvalSK Battery Park will cost $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LPGQDJ"&gt;Ford projects that it will create a total of 11,000 new jobs in the two states. As such, the company says it is prepared to spend $525 million on a nationwide job training program, starting with $90 million on a pilot project in Texas. The hope is to train the next generation of workers on the intricacies of EV manufacturing and maintenance, not only to work at Ford’s factories but also at its dealerships and to make repairs in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpgZVf"&gt;“Our industry has an enormous shortage of technicians,” Farley said. “We need to recruit a huge number of technicians who are good at doing service on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fK7Ij5"&gt;Ford is receiving financial incentives from both states in exchange for agreeing to build there. Tennessee and Kentucky are also both contributing money in the form of training grants to ensure that future workers have the necessary skills. But Farley said the primary consideration was finding locations with competitive energy rates, since a battery plant uses five times the energy of a traditional assembly plant. Ford also prioritized finding “greenfield” sites with no prior environmental issues so that it could build quickly. “We need to move fast,” said Farley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nm9WFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford’s shift to electric vehicles has not been without its speed bumps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDUc85"&gt;Ford’s shift to electric vehicles has not been without its speed bumps. This week, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696482/ford-mustang-mach-e-glass-windshield-recall-roof"&gt;issued two recalls for its Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;, after determining that the adhesive used to attach the windshield and optional glass roof wasn’t secure enough. It was the Mach-E’s second recall, after an earlier investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;discovering loose subframe bolts&lt;/a&gt;. Customer deliveries of the Mach-E were delayed, too, after the company discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;software problem that led to the 12-volt battery dying&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkcTig"&gt;When asked about the recalls, Farley acknowledged that Ford has “a lot of work to do as a company around quality” and added “we have to get it right.” He also employed a baseball metaphor that he is fond of using in media interviews. “This is the first inning,” he said. “But boy, the demand is strong. And people absolutely love this car. We just have to make it better every day. And that’s on us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctwkOw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwzfhq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard strikes $18 million settlement with US employment watchdog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqUW_bMkSQ1_xE-NHCkdJuzFnv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917617/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Mlkm8"&gt;The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Activision Blizzard have &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/consent-decree-with-EEOC"&gt;settled a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over the games company’s allegedly pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination. The news follows an EEOC suit &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.832570/gov.uscourts.cacd.832570.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed Monday in California court&lt;/a&gt; that was based on a three-year investigation including cooperation from the games publisher. As part of the settlement, Activision Blizzard will create an $18 million fund to compensate employees who claim damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRy9Za"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-investigating-activision-blizzard-over-workplace-practices-disclosures-11632165080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that Activision Blizzard was in settlement talks with the EEOC, and the company &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-provides-update-workplace-initiatives"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it was “actively engaged in continued discussions with the EEOC.” In its complaint, the EEOC says it notified the company of its findings on June 15th after launching an investigation in September of 2018, then engaged in “extensive conciliation discussions” with Activision Blizzard. In addition to establishing the fund for restitution, the company agrees to cease any discriminatory practices (a position Activision Blizzard has committed to in past statements), retain a consultant to ensure compliance, upgrade its training and performance review processes to prevent future offenses, and submit to future EEOC audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHPPqw"&gt;“We will continue to be vigilant in our commitment to the elimination of harassment and discrimination in the workplace. We thank the EEOC for its constructive engagement as we work to fulfill our commitments to eradicate inappropriate conduct in the workplace,” said Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-commits-expanded-workplace-initiatives"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; on the agreement. Any unclaimed funds will go toward non-profit organizations that focus on “advancing women in the video game and tech sectors” or promoting awareness of gender quality, or toward future diversity and inclusion investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="91TxSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Activision Blizzard confirmed it was under investigation last week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZCXBb"&gt;The EEOC complaint was one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686183/blizzard-chief-legal-officer-leaves"&gt;several legal battles for Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously been sued by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html"&gt;the company’s investors&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674269/activision-blizzard-sued-nlrb-labor-violations"&gt;Campaign to Organize Digital Employees&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; also reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684779/activision-blizzard-investigation-sec-activision-bobby-kotick"&gt;investigating the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhBUvp"&gt;The lawsuits — as well as stories from employees at Activision Blizzard — paint a picture of a company with a “frat house” atmosphere where female employees were verbally and physically harassed without consequence. Multiple executives, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, have departed the company in the wake of the revelations, and the company has updated elements of its games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22638947/blizzard-overwatch-mccree-name-change-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to remove references to employees accused of harassment or other offending behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFxovk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 7:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with news of settlement between Activision Blizzard and EEOC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix reveals how many accounts are actually watching its top titles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6QC6VcqOeNZYB4Zr2IRCk-4F9JU=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917512/REC_ASA3_CODE21_20210927_143331_0193_X3.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asa Mathat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCrTC0"&gt;During this year’s Code conference, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos shared a significant haul of data about some of the streaming giant’s top titles — a rare move for a company that traditionally holds numbers close to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nii9Cx"&gt;In one slide, shared while Sarandos was speaking on the Code stage with Kara Swisher, Netflix shared numbers about how many accounts viewed its top 10 films and series based on the number of accounts that watched at least two minutes of the title during the first 28 days it was on Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVadpP"&gt;The first season of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; led its top series list with 82 million accounts having viewed the title, followed by part one of &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher,&lt;/em&gt; with 76 million accounts having watched each. &lt;em&gt;Extraction&lt;/em&gt; led its top films list with 99 million accounts, followed by &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; with 89 million accounts and &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt; with 85 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAyd9acUZ4Xd6vaUg0dSgPLbqgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883359/Netflix_Code_Conference_V2.001_X3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Code 2021&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a4LZLz"&gt;A second slide ranked Netflix’s top 10 films and series based on their total viewed hours during their first 28 days on the service. &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; still topped its series list with a whopping 625 million hours viewed. The fourth installment of &lt;em&gt;Money Heist&lt;/em&gt; followed with 619 million, followed by the third season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; with 582 million hours of viewing. &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; led its list for most popular films based on the metric, with 282 million hours viewed. &lt;em&gt;Extraction&lt;/em&gt; swooped into second place with 231 million hours viewed, while &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; took third with 215 million viewing hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkEH9w"&gt;“We’re trying to be more transparent with the market and talent and everybody,” Sarandos said. “It’s a big black box for everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWvQikvNyH3aZPYnATRab-Evhq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883365/i_L578TP9_X3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Code 2021&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NC8fRy"&gt;The decision to share the figure comes at a key moment for creatives and talent in streaming. Services across the board have traditionally offered limited information about how titles perform on their platforms, an issue that’s become a point of frustration in a rapidly changing entertainment space that’s seen even highly anticipated titles meant for theaters instead head straight to streaming services — or debut as hybrid releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fa4Ci"&gt;But the numbers also show that there are many ways to define a “hit.” Netflix’s data was tracked by total hours of viewing and the length of time viewers spent watching a title during its first month on the service. Talent and production companies, however, might be more interested in the number of times a title was viewed start to finish, or how many total people — not just accounts — are watching their shows. Ultimately, without a unified standard among services for what those metrics for success look like, streamers are still very much playing by their own individual rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s CEO has bad news if you were hoping to see Fortnite NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQD4QE5Oq53CpwdhVzseGZX493Q=/0x0:1863x1242/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917260/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_9.21.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apparently the glowing orb is not an NFT.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s0QjHe"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Epic isn’t touching NFTs, in a public response to what was presumably an NFT pitch. He cites the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;space’s problem with scams&lt;/a&gt; as the reason for his hesitancy, which sparked some &lt;em&gt;discussion&lt;/em&gt; in the comments (as strong statements about crypto tend to do). Sweeney has since clarified his views on NFTs a little, saying that, to him, owning an NFT is about as valuable as liking an image on Twitter and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442541632885182466?s=20"&gt;calling into question&lt;/a&gt; whether NFT ownership is actually non-fungible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9RcG8"&gt;While Sweeney’s publicly made his position clear, it’s not likely to stop him from getting a wave of NFT pitches, which you can see for yourself by searching “@TimSweeneyEpic nft” on Twitter. It’s understandable why people try, though — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417447/fortnite-revenue-9-billion-epic-games-apple-antitrust-case"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has made billions&lt;/a&gt; through the sale of virtual objects, and there’s been a lot of discussion around using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632765/vine-creator-dom-hofmann-blockchain-video-game-nft-supdrive"&gt;NFTs in video games&lt;/a&gt; (not that Epic and Sweeney were small fries before &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; took off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZBYd"&gt;While the NFT space does have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;fake art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;shady goings-on at major companies&lt;/a&gt; (along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;various other scams&lt;/a&gt; that have taken off as NFTs rocketed to prominence this year), that’s probably not why we aren’t seeing V-NFTs take the place of V-Bucks. A more likely answer is that, so far, Epic doesn’t need to use blockchain tech to make money, and NFTs aren’t ready to solve problems like its fight with Apple over what’s allowed in the App Store. It’s not like scams are stopping other well-known companies from diving into the space — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA-licensed Top Shots&lt;/a&gt; has operated without &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/27/investing/top-shot-withdrawal-nba-nft/index.html"&gt;incidents&lt;/a&gt; raising too many eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dda8jx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Replied:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We aren’t touching NFTs as the whole field is currently tangled up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations, and scams.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="AmGOir"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJFPJu"&gt;Interestingly, Sweeney also retweeted part of a semi-viral thread about “Web 3,” or a &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3"&gt;popular concept in the crypto community&lt;/a&gt; of rethinking the web, focusing on blockchains and tokens. The idea is that Web 3 is a return to the decentralized nature of Web 1, as opposed to “Web 2.0,” where most people spend their days on platforms owned by massive companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Of course, cryptocurrency (especially Ethereum) plays a big part in that vision. The part of the thread Sweeney retweeted recalls an early version of the web with open protocols and more community government, though how that relates to the future of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is unclear — perhaps it was just some nostalgia for a web that seems to be long gone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Charge 5, is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7oTw3UgNWOkFUmZpIKKB-E0diDg=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917127/jpeters_210914_4757_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Charge 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkjLeB"&gt;Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Fitbit Charge 5, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Ftrackers%2Fcharge5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available for purchase&lt;/a&gt;. The $179.95 tracker offers a number of improvements over the Charge 4, including a slimmer design and a bright color screen. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;in my review&lt;/a&gt;, I had some frustrations with the software and the lack of any sort of physical button. And you should know that two of the new tracker’s headline features, an ECG app and the ability to give a new Daily Readiness Score, aren’t available just yet. Those are arriving in the coming months, Fitbit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e68Lfb"&gt;Fitbit is also announcing new features coming to some of its devices for people who subscribe to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fservices%2Fpremium&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Premium service&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $9.99 per month. Snore and noise detection is now available for all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fsmartwatches%2Fversa3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Versa 3&lt;/a&gt; users who are Fitbit Premium subscribers, and content from the meditation app Calm is now available in the Fitbit app, also for Premium subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
