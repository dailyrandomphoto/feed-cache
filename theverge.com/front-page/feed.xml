    <title>Audi RS E-tron GT review: electric extravagance </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But for $140,000, is it worth it?  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KPcBLA"&gt;I won’t mince words: the 2021 Audi RS E-tron GT is hands down one of the best electric cars I’ve ever driven. It’s gorgeous, sophisticated, incredibly powerful, but it is also very, very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4bc19"&gt;The E-tron GT is the perfect example of why sometimes it pays to be part of a global conglomerate like the Volkswagen Group. Rather than try to cram its pre-existing EV architecture into a sportier package, Audi simply borrowed the one used by its sister company Porsche for its first all-electric sports car, the Taycan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJvABf"&gt;The result is everything an electric sports sedan is supposed to be: fast, opulent, and a bit stubborn in its adherence to traditional design. While some electric cars are just high-end computers in the shape of a car, the Audi E-tron GT is interested in being a car first. There’s no oppressively huge touchscreen, no undercooked semi-autonomous safety system, nothing that should give anyone with a big enough bank account any reason to pause before clicking “yes” on a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mzjFgr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;fast, opulent, and a bit stubborn in its adherence to traditional design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgvF7T"&gt;Some would argue that the E-tron GT is just a rebodied Taycan, and they’d be totally right. And what’s wrong with that? The Taycan is also a fantastic electric sports car. They were developed alongside each other and share an impressive 800-volt architecture that enables quick charging. The E-tron GT’s dual electric motors — one in the front axle and one in the rear — enable between 522 and 637 horsepower depending on the model and an innovative two-speed transmission that makes for breathtaking take-offs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0TXN5"&gt;But all that elegance and power don’t come cheap. The Audi RS E-tron GT, which starts at $140,000, is more expensive than the Taycan, the Tesla Model S, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the Mercedes-Benz EQS. It’s also pricier than the Audi RS7, which is a luxurious speed demon in its own right. As far as I can tell, it’s more expensive than most luxury EVs, a segment that is growing rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5GoaWd"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Audi E-Tron GT|104334" data-volume-uuid="15f13832b" data-volume-id="104334" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-511" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="csao1W"&gt;Grandly touring &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="Z61WdM"&gt;Normally, when I get a loaned vehicle, I try to integrate it into my everyday life: taking the kids to school, groceries, errands, etc. But the E-tron GT demanded a different tact. It’s not that I couldn’t bring myself to sully the backseat with a car seat or let my kids wipe their dirty sneakers on the seatbacks. Rather, it was because the E-tron GT is a sophisticated driving machine and demands to be treated with respect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gc9iT"&gt;Stand on the accelerator, and you can see why. The RS E-tron GT boasts 440kW, or about 590 horsepower, and in overboost mode, that number jumps to 637 horsepower. It can sprint to 60mph (100 km/h) in 3.3 seconds — not as quick as 2.2 seconds boasted by the Taycan Turbo S, but certainly impressive when you consider the E-Tron GT weighs over 5,000 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOXtQv"&gt;I’ve driven enough EVs that the thrill of near-instantaneous torque has lost a bit of its shine. Nonetheless, the RS E-tron GT managed to get my blood pumping every time I stomped on that accelerator: the skittering sound of fall leaves blasting out from under the back 21-inch tires, and then a whoosh as I was shoved back into the leather seats. (Artificial leather and microfiber are also available as an option.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rM32fN"&gt;The steering felt accurate, and the slight body roll felt necessary to give the driver a good sense of the road. The RS gets torque-vectoring and rear-axle steering as standard, while base model owners will need to cough up an extra $6,000 for those features. The wedge-shaped body handled itself ably on especially curvy roads, and the brakes were extremely efficient at hauling the Audi down from speed — which is good because, when driving this car, you tend to use the brakes a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NGxz7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the brakes were extremely efficient at hauling the Audi down from speed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Drdn"&gt;Unlike some competitors, Audi doesn’t offer one-pedal driving that is typically offered in most EVs. The maximum regenerative braking, which is activated by plus- and minus-paddles on the steering column, doesn’t slow the car down that much. The result is an electric sedan that drives imperceptibly from a conventional gas-powered one, which could help win some fans who are skeptical about shifting to battery power but may disappoint fans of one-pedal driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSQiIq"&gt;One of the neatest features is the ability to adjust what Audi calls the “listener experience,” which is another way of describing the artificial sounds the car makes at low speeds. Electric cars are legally required to make an external noise so other road users can hear them coming. Audi took what could have been a dull task and made it quirky. Among the sound samples used were a model helicopter and a didgeridoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RL6UDy"&gt;It’s not impossible to pick out the sonic nuances while driving the E-tron GT, but the overall effect is kind of lost. You’re left with a digital whirring sound that is not that dissimilar from a variety of other EVs I’ve driven recently. And my brain is not so far gone as to prefer it over a V10 engine roar. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two charging ports, one on either side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="0UAU2N"&gt;Charging ahead&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="e56j72"&gt;When charging the Audi RS E-tron GT, you inevitably run into the same problems as you would with every electric car that isn’t a Tesla: the lack of a proprietary network of EV chargers. That said, the E-tron GT doesn’t lack in options. There are connections for alternating current on both sides, and on the right, there is also a connection for direct current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzMEku"&gt;Audi advertises 232 miles of range on a full battery, which falls far short of other similarly priced luxury EVs, like the Model S (412 miles), EQS (350 miles), or Lucid Air (520 miles). I didn’t tackle any steep hills, so presumably, the E-tron GT’s battery drained at a normal rate while I had the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A16cwd"&gt;Audi claims that its 800-volt system enables ultra-fast charging. Just five minutes on a high-speed charging network like Volkswagen’s Electrify America, and the E-tron GT will recover 100 kilometers, or 62 miles, of range. As always, the company is assuming a rate of charge that typically exceeds what most chargers, even fast chargers, actually dole out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-jm7Hp1Y_sk4vdEkeHz_eE7ekw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978043/ahawkins_211028_4857_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audi does not have its own charging network, like Tesla.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OXGl8a"&gt;It took several days of driving to drain the battery below 40 percent. I charged it once at home using the 120-volt outlet in my garage, only adding a couple miles of range after a full eight hours of trickle charging. I also charged it at a public DC fast charger, where it took 42 minutes to charge from 45 percent to 80 percent. That was at a 45kW rate — less than half the advertised top rate of 150kW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ovWg"&gt;It should be noted that Audi does not have its own charging network, like Tesla. But the automaker is offering a couple of workarounds, including three years of complimentary DC fast charging through VW’s Electrify America. (There’s that synergy again!) Audi E-tron GT customers can also get discounted in-home charging installations through a partnership with EV charging provider Qmerit. Still, it won’t be enough to assuage any of the charging anxiety many EV-hesitant car buyers experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a lot of carbon fiber in this car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="wWa2zw"&gt;Hop inside&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="pPmUhC"&gt;To step inside the E-tron GT is to enter a familiar world. There’s a touchscreen display &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;physical buttons for the HVAC system. The air vents are real air vents. There’s a center console, gear stalk, and other physical touchpoints that may seem quaint in an EV world dominated by Tesla. This is not an aggressively minimized EV interior, nor is it one designed to overwhelm the senses. Sure, there’s a lot of carbon fiber — maybe too much? — but the overall look and feel of the interior is sleek and compact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDdgu0"&gt;Front-seat space is generous, but the cockpit is noticeably narrow, and the view out the back window is limited. I think I may have pulled a muscle trying to get in and out of this car, thanks to the low height and smallish door openings. The RS model comes with black leather sport seats with red stitching, which really hug your body and are designed with 14 different adjustable settings, climate control, massage functions — you name it. The steering wheel was covered in a soft suede that was absolutely dynamite to touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UCinfr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Front-seat space is generous, but the cockpit is noticeably narrow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="53XclI"&gt;One of the odder features is the inclusion of a touch-sensitive knob to control the volume on the center console between the seats. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2022-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-review/"&gt;Tim Stevens from &lt;em&gt;Roadshow &lt;/em&gt;likens it&lt;/a&gt; to the infamous click-wheel on an iPod, and I have to agree. But while he found it awkwardly placed, I grew to really like it, to the point where I missed it while driving other vehicles. Of course, you can still control the volume from the steering wheel, but it seemed like a nice touch for passengers who may want to skip tracks or adjust the volume without having to futz with the touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YsQR8dByyeYY9gtjaXEXvNBO8uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978041/ahawkins_211027_4857_0011.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Audi RS E-tron GT is an incredible car to drive, full stop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLfSuR"&gt;The base model E-tron GT comes with a glass roof that can’t be opened and isn’t tinted enough to block the sun. The RS version that I drove, however, swaps that out for an all-carbon-fiber roof. The vehicle already tips the scales at 5,000 pounds, so it seems like Audi went with the carbon fiber to save a little bit of weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qL1v7Z"&gt;The 10.1-touchscreen runs on Audi’s totally serviceable MIB3 software, which wirelessly supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. One of my favorite features was the backup camera, which includes a 3D rendering of the vehicle to help navigate those especially tight parking spaces. Otherwise, the infotainment system was pretty bland. I liked the built-in nav system — the directional cues were easy to follow, and the map itself wasn’t overly cluttered — but considering it runs off of a Google API, there was no compelling reason not to just run Google Maps through CarPlay instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IYxC5O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the infotainment system was pretty bland&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xBzPjX"&gt;I was not impressed with the parking assist feature that is supposed to guide the vehicle into a parking space with limited input from the driver. The interface was opaque, and eventually, I gave up on trying to make it work. The driver-assist system was fine, though you’ll have to pay $2,250 to get advanced features like lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control. And why would you want some software driving your RS E-tron GT for you anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCu1LHEdjM2EGPNHXe9D84iFupA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978046/pesposito_210615_4857_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audi is entering a very crowded segment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="saTVaB"&gt;A crowded segment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="8zJrd7"&gt;It’s been nearly a decade since the Tesla Model S kicked off the EV race with its graceful blend of technological efficiency and addictively fun driving style. Since then, the rest of the auto industry has piled into the luxury EV segment, bringing their own unique style while trying to improve on Tesla’s well-established issues with fit-and-finish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3xwgP"&gt;In addition to the refreshed Model S Plaid (released this year), we’ve got the Mercedes-Benz EQS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13628872/jaguar-ipace-concept-electric-car-suv-unveiled-la-auto-show-2016-photos"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, which is the spiritual cousin to the E-tron GT. Other vehicles slated for imminent release include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;BMW i4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357789/lexus-lf-z-electrified-concept-car-ev-toyota-electric"&gt;Lexus LF-Z&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uqHJA"&gt;The luxury electric market is clearly in overdrive, and the RS E-tron GT is the latest example of the type of sophisticated driving machine you can get with enough money in the bank. It doesn’t beat Tesla on range, nor does it do much to improve on the Taycan, which comes in a slightly less expensive package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xTGFru"&gt;What it does offer is a design that is exclusively Audi. It’s a polished, villainous entrant to the luxury EV market, and it sets the stage for more to come.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic scoops up Rock Band creator Harmonix</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gi0pwL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; maker Epic Games has announced its latest acquisition: Harmonix, the studio behind iconic music games like &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W03BBV"&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/harmonix-is-joining-the-epic-games-family"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Harmonix said that support for existing games like &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fuser&lt;/em&gt; would continue. The studio also explained its plans to expand into — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;what else?&lt;/a&gt; — the metaverse. “Now, we’ll be working with Epic to once again challenge expectations as we bring our unique brand of musical gaming experiences to the metaverse, and we couldn’t be more excited,” the blog post reads. As part of this, Epic says that the studio will “develop musical journeys and gameplay for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVn6TZ"&gt;Music has become an increasing focus for Epic, following the big success of virtual concerts inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;. And according to the company, scooping up Harmonix fits into that musical focus. “Music is already bringing millions of people together in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, from our emotes to global concerts and events,” Alain Tascan, Epic’s VP of game development, said in a statement. “Together with the Harmonix team, we will transform how players experience music, going from passive listeners to active participants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU99Vt"&gt;Epic has made a number of high-profile acquisitions in the game development space over the last few years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; studio Psyonix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309569/epic-games-fall-guys-mediatonic-acquisition-buying-announce-deal"&gt;Mediatonic, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nypGAV"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bbnT9I"&gt;The black configuration of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-True-Wireless-Cancellation/dp/B085LVV8R7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $167 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. Normally $300, the excellent noise-canceling earbuds offer great ANC performance, customizable controls, and sound that can nearly match that of a premium pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6O5W6j"&gt;Sideclick’s Universal Remote Attachment adds more functionality to your Roku streaming player remote and makes it possible to control Blu-ray players, soundbars, TVs, and more with a single remote. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3TymSJkl9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it for $15&lt;/a&gt; instead of $30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="txfke0"&gt;The Nintendo Switch version of &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, easily one of the best games of 2020, is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1191364/9383?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals112321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHades-SuperGiant-Games-Nintendo-Switch%2F132303441&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for just $20&lt;/a&gt;, down from its usual sale price of $35.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pr5JBX"&gt;If you’re looking for a cheap entertainment device, Samsung’s 32GB Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1204229/2092?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals112321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-tab-a7-10-4--34--display-32gb-storage-tablet---gray%2F-%2FA-81915442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $150 at Target&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not going to match an iPad in terms of performance, but it still offers reliable battery life, solid speakers, and a vibrant display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lDDnQ9"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on streaming devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-2021-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-and-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayTechDeals111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrWZYkTQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is offering the streaming device for just $30. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xfNVil"&gt;This accessible Roku alternative from Google features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and the current sale at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has brought the Chromecast with Google TV down to $40, saving you $10 off the regular price. The streaming device features access to all of your favorite streaming services and has a built-in voice assistant to help you find your favorite shows. You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="bsLjhK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ADYgqg"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on laptops and tablets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sBxrPIx7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $330&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $180 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eNqjUh"&gt;The Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="TALLIn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="7OxW8A"&gt;If you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $247 or in white for $223. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id="YeaHyy"&gt;If you’re a PlayStation gamer, Amazon is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B09JTZSB3R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year membership to PlayStation Plus for just $40&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off). This service grants you access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and complimentary titles each month to add to your PSN account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wgOaew"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild%2F141686.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $27 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt; right now, an all-time low for the phenomenal Nintendo Switch exclusive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="49W4Z1"&gt;A three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is $25 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1204229/2092?subId1=Verge%252CBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals112221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital%2F-%2FA-76626995" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgift-cards%2Fdigital-subscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-game-pass-3-month-ultimate-membership%2F11095751.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, granting you access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and a robust library of Xbox games at a fraction of what the subscription normally retails for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TImMO9"&gt;Probably the best deal in gaming — one that spans video games and tabletop games — is Target’s &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="4ie8in"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id="YI7fLA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, an excellent exclusive for the PS5 and PC, is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F11112058.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $25 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pbANF8"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Ambidextrous-Gaming/dp/B08QVM2JMQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sF0uNz2W" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="LClDhH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $170 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bE0eBv"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="OnH62Q"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers offer &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ssYV7eRw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the camera alone for $250&lt;/a&gt;, so this bundle is the better value. It includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div id="AuzgvG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848365"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vh1LyO"&gt;Other great deals happening now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AhcBZ8"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date.

&lt;li id="7PLK8F"&gt;Amazon’s 11th-gen Kindle Paperwhite Kids is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P52R2PL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $115&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. The kid-centric Paperwhite is the same as the 8GB base model but comes with a cover, a two-year warranty, and a year-long subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, which provides your child access to a trove of kid-friendly books and other content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0CAnqM"&gt;The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NFP7KYJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available in either blue or gray&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $80, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the waterproof Bluetooth speaker.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the Niantic/Fold app Fold AR." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-K1yZudSGdGIvUoJxgMQPQNlYU=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183191/AR_Marketing_Subway.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jJSUpu"&gt;Have you ever played &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and thought, “I wish this game let you earn small amounts of Bitcoin by engaging with internet finance memes and a cryptocurrency debit card system?” If so, I don’t believe you, but I have good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwj6i9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; is a new augmented reality game from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic and the financial company Fold. The game — which a press release dubs part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; — is very loosely modeled on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;but themed around cryptocurrency. As explained by Fold CEO Will Reeves, it runs with the metaphor of “mining” Bitcoin. So instead of capturing cute monsters, the central mechanic involves finding cubes of binary code and tapping them like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; blocks until they reveal a prize.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots from the Niantic/Fold game Fold AR" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mpq-PbtNYiOnberG3ZsMiLEm9ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037575/AR_UX_Walkthrough.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0y8ycM"&gt;The prizes include Bitcoin in the denomination of Satoshis, a very small unit currently worth around 1/20th of a penny. They also include power-ups for Fold, which already gamifies card purchases through an app that lets you spin a wheel and win Bitcoin rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkScWT"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and other Niantic games, though, &lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; (which is launched from inside the Fold app) is not currently set in a world full of virtual places that correspond to real-world locations. Instead, the game spawns a block between 1 and 50 feet away from the player every 10 minutes, mirroring the rate of real Bitcoin mining. The team hopes to launch other features beginning early next year, potentially including a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching"&gt;geocaching&lt;/a&gt;-like multiplayer system that lets you hide Bitcoin for friends to find, as well as some form of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;non-fungible token, or NFT&lt;/a&gt;, system based on Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8o9D56"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The app is supposed to make Bitcoin feel more tangible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bPMdvD"&gt;Reeves says the goal is partly to make a virtual currency feel real by creating an AR setting for it. The game is filled with cryptocurrency and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22774719/rivian-ipo-meme-stock-tesla-reddit-wallstreetbets"&gt;meme stock&lt;/a&gt; in-jokes, featuring mechanics with names like “Diamond Hands.” But it’s supposed to appeal to both cryptocurrency newcomers and existing fans — “This is a wonderful experience to share with people,” says Reeves. It’s also reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/5f593804-331d-4e99-81d2-4998a69b76b3"&gt;financial gamification&lt;/a&gt; found in non-crypto investing app Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoFvcM"&gt;More broadly, &lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; is part of a trend called “play to earn” that gives players cryptocurrency rewards instead of purely in-game currency. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;NFT-based play-to-earn game &lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has spawned a complicated economy over the past few years, although that seems far less likely here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUTmJM"&gt;Reeves suggested that Niantic might look at &lt;em&gt;Fold AR&lt;/em&gt; features — including the play-to-earn system — for inspiration. However, he said that there was no official roadmap for anything like adding financial features to any existing Niantic game. He also didn’t disclose precisely what parts of the game Niantic developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qu7U0a"&gt;In a statement, Niantic’s Megan Hughes said that “games always help us push the boundaries of technology and allow us to incubate some of our most audacious thinking, but we see incredible opportunity in multiple categories, including payments.” It’s not a totally new turn for the studio — &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt; featured advertising partnerships &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/5/3954598/google-ingress-augmented-reality-game-partners-with-duane-reade"&gt;with Duane Reade and JambaJuice&lt;/a&gt;, among other companies. But with Niantic also increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22768925/niantic-lightship-developer-platform-john-hanke-pokemon-go"&gt;focused on AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;, it could offer a sign about what kind of experiences that might involve.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great bargain on smart cameras, robot vacuums, and even a smart mop. Here’s our roundup of the best deals on smart home gear you can buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQmoq2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more Black Friday deals? Be sure to check out our continuously updated roundup of all the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best early Black Friday sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lKgkN0"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KckJmY"&gt;The foundation of any smart home is good Wi-Fi, and if you’re looking to start out or are having trouble with connections in your home, a mesh Wi-Fi router is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fos0TC"&gt;Eero Pro 6 is offering up to 40 percent off its excellent mesh Wi-Fi routers that have Thread radios built-in (and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero has said will get upgraded to the new smart home standard Matter&lt;/a&gt;, when it arrives next year). The Eero Pro 6 two pack is selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Amazon for $299&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $100, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eero 6 two pack&lt;/a&gt; is down to $167 from $279. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Read our Eero review.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="X69mMR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Iowp5C"&gt;Google has discounted its Nest Wifi mesh networking system this week. Save $100 off a router and two points (now $249, regularly $349), both of which also double as Google Nest smart speakers. You can currently pick up these deals at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Wifi-3-Pack-AC2200-Mesh-Router-with-2-Points%2F911265019%3Fathcpid%3D911265019%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS004%26athguid%3DYs_KI6dqeEolIlSSTQ_CpjOWULKYy9aKRqT0%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBlackFridaySmartHomeTechDeals112221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3rUqBpdcL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_wifi?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s&lt;/a&gt; own store. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of Google Nest Wifi.&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NR9KWv"&gt;Smart security camera and security system deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eZyOKA"&gt;The cheapest Ring video doorbell, Ring Video Doorbell Wired, gets even cheaper with an $18 price cut to $41.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Wired/dp/B08CKHPP52?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ring Wired uses existing doorbell wiring and works over 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alHazy"&gt;For a battery-powered option, the new Blink video doorbell is just $34.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $10, and it can also be wired if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Ijz8w"&gt;The tiny Blink Mini camera is selling for an even tinier price.

You’ll want to make sure you can mount this on the side of your house first, as it has a rather awkward under-the-eave install. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of this floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PyzsDl"&gt;Abode’s great little Abode Cam 2, an indoor / outdoor camera that works with or without an Abode system, is $24.95 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abode.&lt;/a&gt; If you want to add a security system, too, Abode has an excellent bundle exclusively &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website for $299&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $300.

&lt;li id="9F8lFk"&gt;Another smart security deal is the Ecobee SmartCamera with voice control for $69.99 (regularly $99.99). This versatile indoor camera works with Alexa, Google, and HomeKit.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roborock S7 vacuum and mop is seeing its first discounts this Black Friday shopping week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gTxptp"&gt;Smart robot vacuum deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="eDfoXY"&gt;This first-time deal on Roborock’s flagship robot vacuum-and-mop-in-one is running through November 29th. The Roborock S7 is a mopping and vacuum hybrid robot that is smart enough to raise its mop when it meets carpet, so it can clean all your surfaces. The S7 is now $454.99 (regularly $649.99), a discount of $195, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VHZJ6R2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The Roborock S7+, the bot plus an auto-empty dock, is also on sale with a 30 percent discount of $229.49 taking it down to $719.99 (regularly $949.48) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094N5D4NM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to check the coupon code to get the full discount.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nTIyCO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876174"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bEsScB"&gt;The holiday season is the time to jump on whole-home automated cleaning, and iRobot’s robot vac Roomba i3 Plus with self-emptying base and a Braava Jet m6 mop bundle is a steal at $585 (regularly $850)  at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3scripyja" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can also pick up the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sepiNNMQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roomba i3 Plus with Clean Base&lt;/a&gt; on its own for $399, regularly $599.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3qtfvz"&gt;If you’ve steered clear of robot vacuums because you don’t want to tidy up every time you run one (the cable clutter struggle is real) or empty the tiny bin — ever — Samsung’s Jet Bot AI Plus with Self Empty Clean Station is now $999.99, down from $1,299. Its AI does a good job of avoiding anything you place in its path and you can grab this deal at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sdfPvz6B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://samung.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt; through December 1st.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="H4JgKJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, November 23rd 12:16PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The Samsung Jet Bot AI Plus is selling for $999.99, not $99.99 as an earlier version of this article stated. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The AirPods Pro with MagSafe hit an all-time low of $159 on an early Black Friday deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iObYZbicahrhp4pLOgBoRIMoBjo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183080/cwelch_191031_3763_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro were recently refreshed with a MagSafe compatible charging case.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1UIw3f"&gt;The Black Friday season just keeps on rolling, and we keep seeing such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;exceptional early deals&lt;/a&gt; day in and day out. If things keep up at this rate, we may all go broke by the time Black Friday actually arrives — but wow, will we have saved so much money on the coolest tech in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJeVro"&gt;As the days go on, we continue to track the latest deals we can find for you. That means we’re constantly updating our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"&gt;ongoing deal coverage&lt;/a&gt; while we check new deals that are worthy of your attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZZNoo"&gt;Today is no exception, where we have the best price ever on the AirPods Pro. The latest revision of the AirPods Pro, complete with its MagSafe-compatible charging case, has dropped to a historical low of just &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals112321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$159 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That is a whole $90 off the usual price and a steeper discount than anyone else is offering. Walmart initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;required a Walmart Plus subscription&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s now available to all and Amazon has matched it. The AirPods Pro need no introduction, as they are one of the best active noise-canceling pairs of earbuds available on the market for iPhone and Mac users, with deep iOS integration and support for Apple’s immersive spatial audio feature. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3oXauj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday deals on true wireless earbuds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22792011/black-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="PEvO8V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882517"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkGe8L"&gt;If gaming is your jam, but your life needs a little more flexibility to squeeze in short play sessions, many people suggest a Nintendo Switch. While the Switch is a great console worth owning, there are some game franchises you can’t play on it. Luckily, the Backbone One controller offers mobile users a bit of that Switch-like portability by combining your iPhone with game streaming services like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or your very own desktop via Steam Link. It’s also just a very good controller for many of the exceptional titles available on Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF2pSK"&gt;The Backbone One is currently available directly from &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1733403&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=107979&amp;amp;urllink=playbackbone%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone%2Done%2F&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDeals112321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone Labs for $15 off&lt;/a&gt;, knocking the price down to its lowest yet at $85. It also comes with three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for free. Note that if you have an iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max, be sure to check the box for a free, 3D-printed adapter that will ship separately. Backbone can also provide you with a printable STL file if you have a printer of your own. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ofRYaW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Backbone releases free adapter and 3D-print files for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695887/backbone-controller-iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-3d-printed-adapter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="iIEBea"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwxMys"&gt;Like the idea of using your phone as a game streaming hub, but you prefer Android over iOS? We’ve got you covered with a great deal as well. The Razer Kishi mobile controller for Android is a solid alternative to the Backbone One and nearly half the price. Amazon has the Android-compatible Kishi for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45, a discount of $35&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new historic low price for Razer’s mobile controller, and it’s compatible with all the popular streaming services, including Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Nvidia GeForce Now, Google Stadia, and Steam Link. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1cuZnt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882522"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="32q9T8"&gt;A few more early Black Friday and daily deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aJpoP9"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 has received its best discount so far. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HF1DC1J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is shaving $20 off the 41mm, aluminum models with GPS&lt;/a&gt;, dropping them down to $380. This includes the blue, red, green, and silvery starlight colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

If you don’t have Prime, you can still get the deal for $170. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wz9Jb5"&gt;The popular Fujifilm X-T4 mirrorless camera is $200 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084ZTV3QK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1548388-REG%2Ffujifilm_16652855_x_t4_mirrorless_digital_camera.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798342%2Fapple-airpods-pro-backbone-one-iphone-controller-razer-kishi-black-friday-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for the body only, in either black or silver. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21151718/fujifilm-xt4-announced-specs-pricing-ibis-stabilization-vlogging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our initial hands-on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>NASA wants to defend Earth from asteroids — so it’s slamming a spacecraft into one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LHJ4Rj1xTB-P8yj9tpTO41jjmqc=/417x0:4917x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183074/DART_still_revisedA.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the DART spacecraft approaching Dimorphos&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA/John Hopkins APL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Takeoff of DART is scheduled for 1:21AM ET on November 24th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="MZZ5sK"&gt;Late this evening, NASA is launching a spacecraft the size of a refrigerator, sending it on a crash course with an asteroid in 2022 — and it’s all on purpose. This intentional self-destruction will tell us if slamming a spacecraft into an asteroid is enough to save Earth in the future if a massive space rock is headed our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVjzPy"&gt;The mission is called DART, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart"&gt;or the Double Asteroid Redirect Mission&lt;/a&gt;, and its purpose is in the name. The spacecraft is going to try to redirect an asteroid in space for the first time. The idea is pretty simple: DART is going to ram into the object moving at roughly 15,000 miles per hour, transferring its momentum to the asteroid. This body slam should be enough to deflect the asteroid off its original path by a fraction of 1 percent. The asteroid DART is targeting doesn’t pose any threat to Earth, and there’s nothing the mission can do to change that. NASA just wants to see if bumping a space rock well ahead of time could change its direction enough so that over the long-term, it would whiz by a planet safely instead of hitting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tP40dz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making asteroid impacts a preventable natural disaster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5mLEQr"&gt;It’s a type of technique that we couldn’t have really considered 30 years ago, but with recent advances in technology, it might just be an option for saving the planet one day. “We’ve got the ability, with current technology, to be able to at least start to make asteroid impacts a preventable natural disaster,” Tom Statler, the program scientist for DART at NASA, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ocdQeA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planetary Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FbbCMY"&gt;A significant part of NASA’s overall charge is the concept of planetary defense: protecting Earth from asteroids or other space objects that might cross paths with our planet. It’s also the part of NASA’s mission that seems to capture the imaginations of the general public and Hollywood the most. Films like &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deep Impact&lt;/em&gt; have envisioned various ways that NASA might try to stop an asteroid or comet heading toward our planet. Both of those films, though, see humans traveling to the space rock that would cause our impending doom — a scenario that would most likely never happen because of the immense complexity and safety issues such a mission would pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YnmYGu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s still possible that we could be surprised one day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1637683548.056400"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt;, humanity discovers an asteroid the size of Texas just 18 days away from hitting the planet. Such short notice for a planet-killing asteroid is also unlikely, as NASA is on a constant search for such rocks. Right now, our biggest workhorse asteroid hunters are the two Pan-STARRS telescopes in Haleakala in Hawaii, which scan the sky for asteroids we haven’t found yet. Once the rocks are spotted, scientists can figure out their paths around the Sun to see if they might ever intersect with our planet. So far, there are no asteroids that we know about that will pose a hazard in the next 100 years, and we’ve found most of the largest ones that could cause global devastation.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The vapor trail left by the Chelyabinsk meteor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6iYrfF"&gt;However, it’s still possible that we could be surprised one day. NASA believes it has found only about 40 percent of all near-Earth asteroids that are larger than 140 meters, or 460 feet, across — the ones that would do unthinkable destruction if they were to hit a populated area. And we’ve been surprised by dangerous space rocks before. In 2013, a meteor the size of a house blasted apart in the skies over Chelyabinsk, Russia, without any warning, causing an explosion similar to 440,000 tons of TNT and injuring more than 1,600 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRcP2N"&gt;The Chelyabinsk meteor was thought to be just 18 meters, or 60 feet, across, and it still did major damage. That’s why NASA is really eager to find asteroids that are between 140 and 150 meters across. An impact from one could lead to mass casualties, refugee crises, political instability, supply chain disruptions, and more. “If the impact were in a populated area or a technology center, that could be very severe,” says Statler. “Even if the direct effects were very localized, it could have worldwide effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LNH0tA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nudge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YyoreU"&gt;To prevent such a nightmare scenario, scientists have floated lots of different ideas. Some have suggested sending nuclear devices into space to either destroy a hazardous asteroid or blow up near it to create a shockwave that would knock it off course. However, launching nukes into space is tricky to navigate, considering their use in space is prohibited under international law. Plus, it’s just incredibly difficult to actually blow up asteroids, which are typically moving through space at upwards of 40,000 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BlvLh"&gt;NASA scientists think simply nudging an asteroid when it’s still relatively far from us is an easier solution. But NASA has never tried pushing an asteroid off its course before. With the DART mission, the space agency is starting off small. The mission is heading toward an asteroid named Didymos, which is about 2,500 feet wide or roughly the height of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building in Dubai. But that’s not the spacecraft’s end target. DART is actually going to smash itself into a moonlet asteroid that orbits around Didymos, called Dimorphos, that’s about 525 feet, or 160 meters, wide. The collision will transfer enough momentum to change Dimorphos’s orbit around the larger rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4c4eaed4L1vpfhetOfDX-ANPFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037517/pd_arecibo_radar_images_didymos.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radar images of Didymos and its moonlet taken in 2003.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOGRgs"&gt;The problem, though, is we’ve actually never s&lt;em&gt;een&lt;/em&gt; Dimorphos before. We just know that it’s orbiting around Didymos because it periodically passes in front of the asteroid, slightly dimming the light bouncing off the larger rock. Based on that dimming, scientists know the moonlet’s approximate size and the time it takes to orbit Didymos. The DART spacecraft — which will weigh 550 kilograms or 1,210 pounds at impact and is shaped like a big box — is expected to change the time it takes Dimorphos to orbit Didymos by at least 73 seconds, if not several minutes, after slamming into the moonlet. It’s a process that will lead to the complete destruction of DART, what Statler refers to as an “extreme smithereen-ing event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWnk0r"&gt;But we really have no idea what kind of asteroid we’ll find when we get there, which creates uncertainty about exactly what will happen to Dimorphos. In fact, the asteroid is so small and dark that DART mission engineers may not see it until just an hour before the spacecraft hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bdZiN8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;we really have no idea what kind of asteroid we’ll find when we get there&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpzNeI"&gt;“The thought right now is that it’s made out of the same thing as the main asteroid, but we don’t have any real proof of it because we don’t know anything about that moon,” Elena Adams, the DART mission systems engineer at John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Based on past missions to asteroids, NASA is realizing that the surfaces of some asteroids are very fluid and crushable, almost like liquids. How that kind of material responds to an impact from a spacecraft like DART is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ow6NC"&gt;The good news is we should be able to see DART’s destruction. Just before impact, the main spacecraft will deploy a tiny spacecraft the size of a cereal box that will pass by Dimorphos three minutes after impact and record the resulting plume from the smash. That way, we’ll be sure that DART did its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Zo0gia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hfg6aO"&gt;Measuring a slight change in an asteroid’s path is no easy feat. But NASA has a plan for this. In the days and weeks following DART’s demise, astronomers will use telescopes to observe Didymos and Dimorphos, watching as the moonlet periodically dims the main asteroid. If the timing of those dims changes over time, that means the moonlet’s orbit has been altered and DART did its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kyw87"&gt;For a more detailed look at how DART affected the Didymos system, the European Space Agency will launch a spacecraft called Hera in 2024 that will meet up with the binary pair in 2026. The mission will do a complete survey of the system to map out DART’s impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YHXxyL8E_PvPqWnqFtmlVS2Y_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037524/51700230393_0e4dee94c5_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket in California, with DART on top&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q3HwsI"&gt;If DART turns out to be a success, imparting just a tiny change to the orbit of Dimorphos, that could jumpstart discussions about how to deal with a hazardous asteroid in the future. Perhaps we could bank a bunch of DART-like spacecraft on the ground, ready to deploy when we find an asteroid heading toward us. “It’s a broad discussion, inside and outside of government, to figure out how prepared do we want to be?” says Statler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnv4Pt"&gt;Before that happens, DART has to meet its fate, and that all begins with a launch. The spacecraft is set to take off on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket out of Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 1:21AM ET on Wednesday, November 24th. For the mission team, it’s a bittersweet moment as they say goodbye to their spacecraft, sending it toward its doom. But it’s also a pretty cool experience. “I mean, how often do you get to crash $250 million spacecraft, right?” Adams says. “Not very often.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hawkeye starts out strong because it doesn’t take itself too seriously</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hawkeye" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTmFGXmeWhvRBy-BOQlWy06pLtI=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70183028/APT_102_06114_R5.G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkKgUG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is a few different things. It’s a chance to spend more time with one of the lesser-known Avengers, it’s an origin story for an up-and-coming hero, and it’s a detective drama set amidst the backdrop of Christmas in New York City as the MCU adds yet another genre to its all-enveloping fold. Most importantly, though, it’s a Marvel series that doesn’t take itself too seriously — making the first two episodes unexpectedly fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5puQE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This review contains some light spoilers for the first two episodes of Hawkeye.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WujvMW"&gt;Though it’s named after the bow-wielding Avenger, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; really is a story about two people. Yes, one of those is Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), a surly hero and one-time vigilante who is now doing his best to enjoy life with his kids who were originally killed as part of Thanos’ genocidal plan. In a stereotypical Christmas in New York montage, we see Clint and his family attending a musical (a goofy show about the Avengers that features a singing Hulk) and taking his kids out for Chinese food. As much as he tries to be happy, though, time and countless battles have taken their toll. He spaces out, gets annoyed when recognized in public, and now sports a hearing aid after standing too close to a few too many explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWuPrc"&gt;The other side of the story is Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), who grew up idolizing Hawkeye to the point that she became a state champion archer. Their stories intersect when Kate rescues and then dons the costume of the Ronin — &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ronin%27s_Campaign"&gt;a key part of Clint’s story in the MCU&lt;/a&gt; — and gets into a fight with a criminal syndicate known as the Tracksuit Mafia. When Clint sees the Ronin suit on the news, he’s forced to ditch his idyllic family time to figure out what’s going on. Eventually, the two archers join forces, though, naturally, Clint is a reluctant partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q96olk"&gt;There’s a mystery at play here surrounding the Ronin suit, but the highlight of the show is the growing, often adversarial, relationship between Kate and Clint. The original Hawkeye, of course, wants nothing to do with it. He’s just trying to fix everything as quickly as possible and get back to his family. At one point, he actually tells Kate that she’s ruining his Christmas. Meanwhile, this is a moment Kate has been dreaming about since she was young, and she doesn’t want to let it go. They have a great kind of combative chemistry, seemingly always approaching problems from the exact opposite perspective. At one point, Clint gives her his phone number but warns that it’s only for emergencies. No personal calls, or else he’ll “block and delete you.” As he walks away, Kate shouts out, “Call you later!” The chemistry is strong enough that even one of the least-charming characters in the MCU becomes likable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QB7lqR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3aXPMA1Jac?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fqLfHf"&gt;This contrast between self-serious, cynical Clint and his more energetic and charming counterpart is what makes the show work early on. It extends beyond the characters as well. There are times when &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; looks and feels like a gritty drama, like during its Daredevil-style fight sequences or when Clint is exasperated dealing with fans trying to take selfies with him in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSqrZV"&gt;But it’s balanced out nicely because of all the more lighthearted moments. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is at its best when it’s putting Clint, in particular, in ridiculous scenarios; at one point, he’s forced to participate in a LARP despite very clearly not wanting to participate in the imaginary battle. My personal favorite moment was when a group of mobsters start bickering about NY real estate when someone makes fun of their warehouse hideout. There’s even a dog who eats pizza named Pizza Dog (just one of many nods to Matt Fraction and David Aja’s run on the &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; comics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UaBjd"&gt;Not everything about &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; works — its serious moments can come off a little heavy-handed, like some “Thanos was right” graffiti in a bathroom, and I’m not fully sold on the Christmas theme just yet — but its first two episodes leave a solid initial impression. Like the best of the MCU on Disney Plus so far, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577248/loki-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; stands on its own &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough to largely avoid superhero fatigue. That could change as the show continues and connects more to the overarching MCU. But early on, it manages to make a show about the least-fun Avenger into something with a surprising amount of heart and humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1ArNU"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;debuts on Disney Plus on November 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arc raises $30 million to power its electric boat ambitions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1UDBooDQv13lluJ9e_Q1bU2K5_E=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182942/Arc_One___Dock_Interior.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jAJH1t"&gt;Electric boat startup Arc has raised $30 million just five months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"&gt;coming out of stealth mode&lt;/a&gt; and has started putting its first prototype through its paces. The Series A funding round was led by Greg Reichow, a partner at Eclipse Ventures and a former vice president of production at Tesla. The round also includes existing Arc investors like Andreessen Horowitz and celebrities like Will Smith, Kevin Durant, and Sean “Diddy” Combs, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/will-smith-kevin-durant-and-sean-diddy-combs-invest-in-electric-boat-startup-arc/"&gt;first put money into the startup in October&lt;/a&gt; through their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8tqvl"&gt;Arc aims to sell a limited number of its first electric boat, the 24-foot Arc One, at an extraordinary price of $300,000 before moving on to making more affordable boats. It plans to justify that price by promising a much lower cost of ownership than gas-powered boats, as well as far easier maintenance and upkeep. Arc founder Mitch Lee is also unabashed that the startup is targeting the types of high-net-worth individuals like the celebrities who’ve invested in the company as its first customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxqVDb"&gt;“That is very much an indication of where we want to take this company from a brand and lifestyle perspective,” Lee said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSftgZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like other startups, Arc is starting at the very high end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNOYYa"&gt;Arc plans for its first boat to have a 200kWh, 800-volt battery pack capable of powering an electric motor with at least 475 horsepower. It will have a top speed of around 40 miles per hour and can last about four hours under power before needing to be recharged — which the startup claims is plenty for a day out on the water. One big claimed advantage of the Arc One’s design over other early electric boats is that it can be used for watersports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4Du3E"&gt;After that, Lee plans to take the money generated from Arc One sales and put it back into research and development to make a more affordable version that the startup could sell thousands of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KTgDYb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric boat startup Arc wants to make a big splash ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cMzXPM"&gt;Lee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that Arc was planning to move quickly, but he said this week that the investment from Eclipse will make it possible to accelerate the startup’s plans. Arc has already been testing a prototype on the water — Lee said one employee has even water skied behind it — and that Arc is “nearing completion on a pre-production version of the Arc One.” The company will begin limited production of the boat at its shop in Los Angeles, California, “in the coming weeks” and start deliveries “shortly thereafter,” Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv9I7J"&gt;Arc already boasts a few former SpaceX employees, but Lee (who came from Credit Karma) said the new funding will help the startup hire in an increasingly competitive electric watercraft market — one that General Motors even dipped into this week when it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796986/gm-pure-watercraft-investment-electric-boats"&gt;an investment in Pure Watercraft&lt;/a&gt;, which makes electric motors and batteries for boats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5DQe5"&gt;Broadly, though, Lee said he thinks Arc has a lot of advantages when it comes to hiring talent that may otherwise have planned to go to automotive EV startups like Rivian or established players like Tesla. Arc employees are more likely to “own” a bigger portion of the development of the boat, as opposed to maybe just a side mirror like at a car company, he said. But most of all, Lee said, “boats are a fun product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kFsha"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8kgVo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid calls for CEO resignation, Activision Blizzard announces a workplace committee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wZa9_hKpCXZokWDj2HmqQECElhE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182816/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xbdEJC"&gt;In the fight against ongoing allegations of harassment, discrimination, and complaints of insufficient action to address such allegations, Activision Blizzard’s board of directors has announced that the publisher is forming a new committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9yzjdm"&gt;The Activision Blizzard board of directors today announced that it has formed a ‘Workplace Responsibility Committee,’ initially comprised of two independent directors, to oversee the company’s progress in successfully implementing its new policies, procedures, and commitments to improve workplace culture and eliminate all forms of harassment and discrimination at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rIb8WE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-continues-build-upon-its"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; — delivered at an extremely late hour during an employee holiday week granted hours before the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;a damning &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; — seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;reaffirms the board’s support for CEO Bobby Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, even as major publishers express concern about and evaluate relationships with Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsIufJ"&gt;Late last week, Nintendo joined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; to become the latest publisher to internally criticize the company. According to a report from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/news/nintendo-issues-internal-response-to-activision-blizzard-reports/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fanbyte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser wrote an email saying, “I find these accounts distressing and disturbing. They run counter to my values as well as Nintendo’s beliefs, values, and policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0sQz4"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s new committee will ensure regular progress updates to the board concerning key accountability measures while promising to add a “new, diverse director to the board.” Meanwhile, as external pressure mounts, a cohort of shareholders have demanded Kotick’s resignation while employees staged a second walkout and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;created a petition&lt;/a&gt; with over 1,800 signatures similarly demanding the CEO step down. &lt;/p&gt;
