    <title>Facebook accidentally lost a piece of its moderation policy for three years</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EItjCZ"&gt;Instagram accidentally banned a post criticizing solitary confinement because Facebook had misplaced the policy allowing it, according to a new Facebook Oversight Board (FOB) decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ7pbW"&gt;The semi-independent Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/IG-I9DP23IB"&gt;says the Facebook-owned site should not have removed&lt;/a&gt; a post about Abdullah Öcalan, a founding member of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Facebook designates Öcalan and the PKK “dangerous entities” that users cannot support on its platforms. In January, moderators applied that policy to a message criticizing Öcalan’s imprisonment and solitary confinement — a practice the United Nations has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/17/18305109/solitary-confinement-prison-criminal-justice-reform"&gt;deemed a form of torture&lt;/a&gt; — in a Turkish prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zwcsmr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Board is concerned that specific guidance for moderators ... was lost for three years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Id0BpO"&gt;The user appealed to the Oversight Board, which agreed to examine the case. As it did, Facebook apparently “found that a piece of internal guidance on the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy was ‘inadvertently not transferred’ to a new review system in 2018.” The policy had been developed in 2017 partly because of the debate over Öcalan’s living conditions, and it “allows discussion on the conditions of confinement for individuals designated as dangerous.” But the internal guidance was never made public to Facebook or Instagram users — and Facebook only realized it had dropped out of the moderation guidelines altogether when the user appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdNDAX"&gt;“Had the board not selected this case for review, the guidance would have remained unknown to content moderators, and a significant amount of expression in the public interest would have been removed,” the FOB’s decision states. Facebook declined to comment on whether it considers that assessment accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh5n5X"&gt;“The board is concerned that specific guidance for moderators on an important policy exception was lost for three years,” the FOB’s decision continues. While Facebook restored the post about Öcalan in April, it told the board it was “not technically feasible” to see how many other posts might have been removed because moderators weren’t aware of the exception. “The Board believes that Facebook’s mistake may have led to many other posts being wrongly removed and that Facebook’s transparency reporting is not sufficient to assess whether this type of error reflects a systemic problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Lk7sv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case demonstrates why public rules are important for users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JNGlFb"&gt;The FOB decision broadly pushes Facebook to make its rules more transparent. “This case demonstrates why public rules are important for users: they not only inform them of what is expected, but also empower them to point out Facebook’s mistakes,” it says. The decision says Facebook is conducting a review of how the policy failed to be transferred, and the FOB has offered a series of further, optional recommendations. They include conducting a review process to see if any other policies were lost, as well as publicly clarifying the limits of its ban on supporting “dangerous individuals and organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V75qkh"&gt;Social networks like Facebook and Instagram often keep parts of their policies secret, saying that releasing totally precise moderation rules lets trolls and other bad actors game the system. However, as the FOB notes, this kind of secrecy on a huge, diffuse service can make miscommunication easier — as it apparently did in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bentley reveals details about its Flying Spur Hybrid, the ‘most efficient Bentley ever’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38dX2nvepIv6xGL5H7G-n4Mm4po=/31x0:1246x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557111/f0456cbd_481c_4a71_abaf_0c69ac1ade01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bentley’s Flying Spur Hybrid.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bentley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaVTRH"&gt;Luxury carmaker Bentley has &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234"&gt;announced details&lt;/a&gt; about its Flying Spur Hybrid sedan, its second Bentley hybrid, which the company claims is the “most efficient Bentley ever.” Using just the electric motor, Bentley says you’ll be able to drive for more than 40 kilometers (or just under 25 miles), and the company says the car offers a “total driving range” of more than 700 kilometers (just under 435 miles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZSdnl"&gt;The Flying Spur Hybrid will be able to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 4.1 seconds, according to Bentley. That’s slower than what Tesla claims for the Model S Plaid, which it says can go from 0-60 in 1.99 seconds, but that’s a feat that’s only feasible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540154/tesla-model-s-plaid-acceleration-test-conditions"&gt;under very specific conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X4mJc9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXWPt26hiHI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jv4dC3"&gt;Bentley also says the car delivers a total of 536 horsepower and 750NM of torque. You can check out the full specs of the Flying Spur Hybrid on &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234"&gt;Bentley’s press release&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/flying-spur/flying-spur-hybrid.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to build your dream hybrid Bentley, &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/misc/car-configurator.html/models/Flying_Spur/flying_spur_hybrid/navigate/pivot"&gt;check out the configurator&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no pricing yet, but if it’s anything in the range of other Bentleys, you’ll probably have to pay a lot of money for the car.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is giving employees a $1,500 pandemic bonus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9r2F_GO2qrVxt7_HRzuvUVq_qfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557040/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANHBIu"&gt;Microsoft is gifting its employees a $1,500 pandemic bonus. In an internal memo seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the software giant says this one-time bonus “is in recognition of the unique and challenging fiscal year that Microsoft just completed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdDzgc"&gt;Microsoft’s chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, announced the gift to employees today, and it will apply to all eligible employees in both the US and internationally. Microsoft is gifting this bonus to all staff below corporate vice president level that started on or before March 31st, 2021, including part-time workers and those on hourly rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyNgig"&gt;Microsoft has 175,508 employees worldwide, but LinkedIn, GitHub, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;and ZeniMax&lt;/a&gt; employees are not eligible for the bonus, despite Microsoft owning these three separate companies. As a result, we understand it’s a gift of around $200 million, or less than two days’ worth of profit for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXkBtB"&gt;It follows similar employee gifts from big companies over the past year, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183513/facebook-giving-1000-dollar-bonuses-every-employee-coronavirus-mark-zuckerberg"&gt;Facebook gifting its 45,000 employees $1,000 each&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s $300 holiday bonus &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/26/amazon-gives-front-line-workers-a-300-holiday-bonus.html"&gt;for frontline workers&lt;/a&gt;, and BT gifting its 60,000 employees &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/philip-jansen-britain-b925906.html"&gt;£1,500 each&lt;/a&gt; (approximately $2,000). Vox Media, owner of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, also gifted employees a $1,000 bonus late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2RWxx"&gt;Microsoft says it has &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/11/microsoft-washington-support-communities-covid-19/"&gt;also donated&lt;/a&gt; “more than $98 million of assistance to nonprofits in Washington state” since the COVID-19 pandemic began, with plans to commit an additional $60 million in support by July. Since the pandemic started, Microsoft has generated at least $160 billion in revenue, thanks to a mix of businesses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;flocking to cloud services&lt;/a&gt;, a boost in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;laptop sales and Windows usage&lt;/a&gt;, and strong &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406254/microsoft-q3-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;Xbox growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Natural Cycles birth control to use a smart ring for temperature measurements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9frvYUOT3HVjYnDRiCLdHPM-pk=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557017/1614590448_learn_status_newbrand.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Natural Cycles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8V08Y"&gt;Digital birth control Natural Cycles can now use temperature data from&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;devices like the Oura smart ring to make predictions on when someone could become pregnant. The company said today it got clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to give users the option of taking their temperature through a device with a temperature sensor, rather than taking it manually with a thermometer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxL3Qe"&gt;The sign-off makes Natural Cycles the “world’s first wearable birth control,” the company said in a statement. The feature is currently only available in a private beta program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtCU4D"&gt;Natural Cycles prevents pregnancy through an algorithm that uses daily temperature measurements and period cycle tracking to give users information about the days of the month when they’re least likely to get pregnant. The app was first cleared by the FDA as birth control in 2018 (a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18139681/natural-cycles-fda-approval-standards-de-novo-digital-health-devices"&gt;controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; at the time). A second birth control app, made by Clue, was cleared &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meYEvf"&gt;A person’s resting body temperature increases during ovulation, and tracking that temperature consistently can tell people when they are more or less likely to become pregnant. Previously, to use Natural Cycles as birth control, people had to take their temperature using a thermometer every day when they woke up. Now, they will be able to wear something like an Oura ring overnight and have their temperature information automatically sent to the app each morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3RviJ"&gt;Natural Cycles tested the Oura ring in a study of 40 women, the company said in its filing to the FDA. Each of the women were experienced Natural Cycles users who both wore the ring and manually took their temperature each day. In total, the analysis included 155 complete menstrual cycles. The algorithm was able to predict ovulation accurately using either temperature reading, the filing said. Using the ring gave users an average of 1.6 additional “not fertile” days during each cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIIs8G"&gt;Elina Berglund, co-founder and CEO of Natural Cycles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548201/natural-cycles-oura-digital-wearable-birth-control-fda"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last fall that the company was interested in wearables in order to make it easier for people to collect temperature information. “We do see that there are some users that have trouble remembering to take their temperature in the morning,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5p2PzB"&gt;Using a wearable to automatically monitor temperature would be easier and could be more accurate — it would measure temperature continuously as someone slept, rather than at a single&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;point in time, Rebecca Simmons, a researcher and fertility awareness specialist at the University of Utah, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548201/natural-cycles-oura-digital-wearable-birth-control-fda"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But research is still limited, even with the study included in the filing. “There’s a long way to go before we can feel like, oh yeah, these are really able to tell us what we need to know in order to predict our fertility,” she said last fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT58Yb"&gt;Natural Cycles now has a hardware team, which it launched after filing for the new clearance with the FDA last year, the company said in a statement. It’s evaluating other wearables and also has plans to build its own device.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6otf1S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISOnLF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The COVID-19 vaccines weren’t hacked — this task force is one reason why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RSx3O-jpGazwClMm0yTPnPufAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556777/acastro_210708_4663_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Securing the supply chain meant focusing on tiny companies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZmrUmM"&gt;Last fall, a tiny company no one had ever heard of was keeping Josh Corman up at night. It was one of the only groups in the world that made an ingredient that pharmaceutical companies like Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech needed to make the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. And it didn’t employ a single cybersecurity expert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orAc42"&gt;Corman is a senior adviser to the United States’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and for the past year, he’s been working on a task force within the agency focused on protecting the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain from cyber threats. Healthcare organizations have been some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;biggest&lt;/a&gt; victims of growing waves of cyberattacks over the past few years, and during the pandemic, they were an even bigger target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyIMLH"&gt;What worried Corman weren’t places like Pfizer and Moderna. Those big, name brand companies all employ in-house cybersecurity experts. He was worried about companies like the one making an mRNA ingredient: small, anonymous groups that made bits and pieces pivotal for vaccines, but that might not have ever thought they’d need to protect against a hacking campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6TBBn0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You could sneeze on that one company, and they would be disrupted.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R663eo"&gt;“You could sneeze on that one company, and they would be disrupted. And if they were disrupted, we’d be living in a very different world right now because they were so critical to those mRNA candidates,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO6NpN"&gt;Over the past year, the task force tracked down hundreds of similar companies critical to the development, production, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. It offered to help them check for any gaps in their digital networks, give them resources to boost their preparedness, and help them respond to any incidents. A cyberattack on any of them could have slowed down the vaccine efforts, keeping shots out of reach for longer — at great cost to the health of the country, Corman says. “We wanted to make sure we had no delays because of cybersecurity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3kmkKJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-creating the supply chain &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9GPdgc"&gt;The US approach to COVID-19 vaccine development ran through Operation Warp Speed — a $10 billion project that involved partnerships between biomedical companies and various agencies within the federal government, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Health and Human Services. It funded the development of vaccine candidates at companies like Moderna and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and was in close contact with others involved in manufacturing and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1p0nh"&gt;“Operation Warp Speed is generally described as being around the 30 biggest companies related to vaccines — research, delivery, and all the way to shipping out to states,” says Beau Woods, a senior adviser at CISA working on the COVID-19 task force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EouVFd"&gt;CISA was one of the other federal agencies pulled into Operation Warp Speed. It’s part of the Department of Homeland Security and is responsible for assisting both the government and the private sector on cybersecurity issues. Along with the COVID-19 response, it spent 2020 working on &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/trump-fires-cisa-director-chris-krebs/"&gt;security for the presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKsxLE"&gt;During Operation Warp Speed, CISA was asked to help with security for the main 30 players. “CISA has the ability to deliver protective, preventative, and response services to designated critical infrastructure. Anyone on that list was obviously prioritized,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bthxJS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were more companies involved with the vaccine development, production, and distribution process than just the ones on that list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4jeZC3"&gt;But there were more companies involved with the vaccine development, production, and distribution process than just the ones on that list. Each of those 30 or so companies have their own supply chains, Woods says. The groups that made up those supply chains would need protection as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er6O0c"&gt;When Corman started working on COVID-19 response efforts as part of the task force within CISA, those companies hadn’t been identified yet. No one knew who they were. “I asked, what are those smaller, less obvious players that, if they’re disrupted, means there’s no vaccine? And no one had an answer,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cUko0"&gt;Corman worked with colleagues like Michelle Holko, a presidential innovation fellow who worked with the task force, and Reuven Pasternak, another CISA senior adviser who’s also a physician, to develop a rubric that would help them identify those players. They looked for companies making products that were in short supply or couldn’t be easily replaced and companies making products that the groups making vaccines were highly dependent on. The group asked international partners to send them the names of any groups that could be important to the vaccine development process as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnu2rU"&gt;“We identified people who were never nominated at all, but bubbled up right to the top. Those were some of the most critically important weak links in the chain,” Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVrcgV"&gt;The list was dynamic — at the start of the process, it focused on groups involved in vaccine research and development. Then it shifted to companies working with the manufacturing and distribution of the shots. Overall, the group identified hundreds of companies involved in the process that could have been risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naeN9h"&gt;“A lot of them are smaller. In some cases, they’d have fewer than 100 people, and may not have traditionally looked at cybersecurity threats,” Woods says. Because they were involved in the vaccine process, they were targets for hackers, but they didn’t have the know-how to protect against threats. “That’s where we focused,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WqKoId"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outreach efforts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="147AmC"&gt;After making that list of companies that could be potential targets for cyberattacks, the task force started reaching out to each one to offer its services. A big part of those early conversations involved making sure companies understood that the group wasn’t a regulatory body but was just coming in to offer a service, says Steve Luczynski, the lead of the CISA COVID-19 task force. “Everybody’s concerned when the government’s calling,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3ND86"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everybody’s concerned when the government’s calling.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JLXY7x"&gt;But after they heard what the group was offering — help understanding any vulnerabilities, alerts about possible threats, and other guidance — many companies were eager to use their resources, Woods says. “In a few cases, we’ve had the organizations come back and say, ‘Hey we saw something, we think we got to it in time — but we’d love for you guys to just double check,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeskG"&gt;Health IT and electronic health records company Cerner was one of the groups that worked with the CISA and the task force. &lt;a href="https://www.cerner.com/perspectives/supporting-the-covid19-vaccination-process-with-technology-and-data"&gt;Cerner assisted&lt;/a&gt; with scheduling, inventory, and dose tracking for organizations administering vaccines, and its electronic health records had data on people receiving the shots. Kevin Hutchinson, Cerner’s cybersecurity operations manager, had initially signed the company up for security alerts with CISA. The CISA task force then got in touch about participating in their other programs. “Given the footprint of Cerner, they were really excited to have us on board,” Hutchinson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xChyUK"&gt;The CISA team took a look at Cerner’s existing security protocols, which were already strong. “It was a good pat on the back that we were doing things that we should be,” Hutchinson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0WxUf"&gt;Cerner also regularly meets with around a dozen of the largest hospital systems that use its services to talk about security, and a handful of those groups were also using CISA’s services. Many hospitals don’t have the funding for a dedicated security team. “They had mentioned how valuable it had been for them,” Hutchinson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cei2wJ"&gt;The task force was able to offer services like scanning company systems for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and custom cyberintelligence tools, Woods says. But one of the most important parts of outreach was just creating a relationship with the company so that CISA was able to quickly relay any important information. “Part of it is just working out that trust, so that when they pick up the phone, they know who you are,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jVDogh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Part of it is just working out that trust, so that when they pick up the phone, they know who you are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1YXEK"&gt;Through those relationships, the task force and CISA helped companies respond to cyber threats over the course of the past year. Threats included a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-vaccine-hackers-phish-ibm-cold-chain/2020/12/03/27a5b0b2-355d-11eb-9699-00d311f13d2d_story.html"&gt;phishing campaign&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the cold chain vaccine transport system and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt;, which targeted US government agencies. None had major impacts on the vaccine development and distribution process. “We had these good connections. We knew that this is the person to call, and here’s the email to send to, when these events happen,” Luczynski says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FG5In"&gt;Those connections could carry through into the future and help healthcare organizations manage cybersecurity threats. “I am happy to see greater engagement between CISA and healthcare, and I definitely hope that continues,” Woods says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKgBeQ"&gt;The work the task force did on the vaccine supply chain could also be a model for other projects in the future, he says. “A lot of times when the government works with the private sector, they’re most engaged with larger organizations because they don’t have connections with the smaller ones,” Woods says. This work showed that, many times, the riskiest areas are actually those smaller organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Q8ssX8"&gt;So far, the COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution process hasn’t been delayed by any cyberattacks. Luczynski says the task force can’t take all the credit — it’s hard to say definitively if its work was the reason there weren’t major issues. But he thinks it made a difference. “I am confident we contributed to making things better.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukX5dl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s What If…? gets a new trailer and an August 11th release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7OPzOIac0rgrDvJELCjf1J7XwM=/228x0:1533x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556760/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_12.33.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DV6F1O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9D0uUKJ5KI"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;is an animated series that promises to showcase alternate takes on the dozens of characters that make up the interconnected universe of movies and shows in the MCU. And now, thanks to a new trailer, we’ve got our best look yet at the upcoming show, which is set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1104507/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;on August 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDLZCn"&gt;As the name implies, &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; will showcase different versions of the MCU and answer questions like, “What if Peggy Carter was chosen to get the Super Soldier Serum instead of Steve Rogers?” or “What if Yondu kidnapped T’Challa instead of Peter Quill when he came to Earth?” Unlike the other Disney Plus Marvel shows, which are live-action, &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; also marks the first animated property in the MCU — a factor that makes it easier to revisit the altered storylines without, say, having to remake the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The First Avenger&lt;/em&gt; in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c04BTg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first animated MCU show&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Eo5Hx"&gt;In addition to a slew of Marvel regulars &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; — which is still considered part of the overarching MCU, despite its alt-universe tales — will introduce Uatu the Watcher (voiced by Jeffrey Wright) to the franchise as the show’s narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQmO0E"&gt;Alternate takes on characters seem to be a popular theme in the MCU right now, with &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; already featuring a slew of different versions of the villain from across the timeline. (And with Marvel’s slate of films and shows continuing to expand, it’s possible &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s animated hypotheticals could one day show up in live-action, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnEmil"&gt;The August release date makes perfect sense, too, given &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s season finale is about to wrap up on July 14th, making &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;the perfect way to make sure the biggest Marvel fans stay subscribed to Disney Plus for another month or two. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why did the Teletubbies forge their vaccination cards?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Teletubbies 20th anniversary party - London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ebtpbSjVuvQe8nTWepNPCuC9yUw=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556711/645519008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jonathan Brady/PA Images via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RX12pm"&gt;Look, the question isn’t &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; the vaccine cards the Teletubbies display in a tweet from Teletubbies HQ are forged. All you have to do is look at the date of the second vaccine: July 22nd, 2021 — that is, two weeks in the future. The question is what they hope to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cHG65I"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re all vaxxed! Just in time for a Tubby hot summer ☀️ Who's ready to come out &amp;amp; play &lt;a href="https://t.co/AtXTExaCMs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AtXTExaCMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Teletubbies (@TeletubbiesHQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeletubbiesHQ/status/1412790031530475524?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vnipc"&gt;There’s more. Check out the dates of birth listed for the Teletubbies: all in 2003. The Teletubbies &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142055/"&gt;premiered on BBC2 in 1997&lt;/a&gt;. Famously, in 1999, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/12/jerry-falwell-and-tinky-winky-the-gay-teletubby.html"&gt;Jerry Falwell condemned Tinky Winky&lt;/a&gt; for being gay. The original run &lt;em&gt;ended &lt;/em&gt;in 2001. The Teletubbies are old enough to drink! A birthdate of 2003? &lt;em&gt;Who the fuck do these creatures think they’re kidding?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vPLcn"&gt;Look, I babysat my younger siblings while they watched the Teletubbies. I’ve had my eye on that Sun Baby for years — the Teletubbies’ god-king, who rules the psychedelic, rabbit-infested, post-apocalyptic word of these creatures. The careful rituals of appeasing the Voice Trumpets and containing the troubles of their misbehaving vacuum cleaner (“Noo-Noo”) are not foreign to me. I just want to know what the plot here is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJXGEL"&gt;There is one other oddity. It appears to be based on an American vaccination card, issued by the CDC. The dates on it are also rendered American style (month, day, year) instead of UK style (day, month, year). Is this a terrible plot by the Sun Baby to confuse UK children? Should we expect a future in which the UK switches to American date style?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asGOvw"&gt;I don’t know what this means&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;but I don’t think it bodes well. Who can know what the Sun Baby ultimately wants? We never did learn why the Teletubbies worshiped it. Perhaps it is looking for more followers — and these vaccination cards are just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Encanto’s first trailer promises a magical, musical Disney adventure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/571sGlPIpyStzd-x-6E_-eP7kJk=/195x0:1737x1028/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556692/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_12.11.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13y4Jv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=togmdDHG3Pw"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the latest animated film from Walt Disney Animation Studios, is full of magic. The upcoming movie is set in a magical village in Colombia, and it focuses on the Madrigal family who each possess their own gifts, like shapeshifting, plant growth, or super-strength. Even the house is enchanted, dancing along to the beat of everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iryDdJ"&gt;Well, everyone except for Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz), that is, who, alone in her family, doesn’t have any special powers. Drama, presumably, ensues, although the first teaser isn’t too forthcoming as to what the actual story here is. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eDXasIAF4wyS9IbKPVulotlX7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705930/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_11.26.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qEKpso"&gt;The film does look spectacular, though, with the Madrigal’s house, in particular, stealing the show with its vibrant colors and unique architecture. In Disney tradition, &lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; is also a musical, featuring songs by the &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2019/2/21/18233226/egot-necklace-30-rock-tracy-morgan-whoopi-goldberg"&gt;EGOT-chasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyq1mM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on November 24th, making it the first major animated film from Disney to not be released straight to Disney Plus since theaters first shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The studio has spent the last year and a half shifting almost all of its major animated releases from both Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar — including &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; — either straight to its streaming service or with concurrent releases in both theaters and on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1104507/9358?subId1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NFL jumps to Twitter Spaces after initial Clubhouse partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S.-TAMPA-NFL-SUPER BOWL" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LiwsaCUud2JnOswJjtHfeJRqjn4=/0x33:2048x1398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556610/1231057154.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Xinhua/Wu Xiaoling via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqhaEz"&gt;The National Football League is signing on to use Twitter Spaces. As part of &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/National-Football-League-and-Twitter-Extend-Partnership-Through-Multi-Year-Deal.aspx"&gt;a new deal&lt;/a&gt; with Twitter — which will see the social network continue to run game highlight videos — the NFL has agreed to host 20 live audio rooms throughout the 2021 season. Those will include “current NFL players and other NFL talent” as hosts discussing the season’s matchups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrmx2F"&gt;Twitter’s partnership with the NFL would appear to be a blow to Clubhouse, which &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/clubhouse-announces-exclusive-content-deal-with-nfl-its-first-official-spo/599005/"&gt;previously partnered with the league&lt;/a&gt; to host live audio rooms during the draft in April. It was Clubhouse’s first official sports league programming — and now the NFL has jumped to Twitter and signed on to be Twitter’s first sports partner. A Clubhouse spokesperson said the company has an “ongoing relationship” with the NFL and NFL Players Association. Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/nhl-clubhouse-stanley-cup-final-montreal-canadiens-tampa-bay-lightning"&gt;also partnered with the National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; to host rooms around the Stanley Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJ7QG0"&gt;Spaces began launching on Twitter in December and the feature has expanded more widely in the months since. The launch came as Clubhouse was blowing up in popularity, but the live audio service now faces competition from all sides; in addition to Twitter, Facebook and Discord have launched competitors, and similar features are being developed inside Slack, Reddit, and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTdBaH"&gt;While the vast majority of programming on these live audio apps is user-generated, the obvious next step for these networks is to try bringing in major talent to hook viewers who might not otherwise tune in. Twitter has been partnering with the NFL since 2013, so presumably, the network has seen some worthwhile engagement out of giving the league a formal presence on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vilo’s three-router mesh Wi-Fi system covers your home for just $59</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PwlKbQFebammfwQw-YAShwk-PY0=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69556536/Vilo_March2021_ErinLodiPhotography_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A single Vilo router costs $19.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vilo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9Qg9R"&gt;Vilo is a new mesh Wi-Fi company that promises a three-device system that covers up to 4,500 square feet for just $59. That’s much more affordable than the mesh Wi-Fi systems offered by more established brands like Eero, whose &lt;a href="https://eero.com/shop/eero"&gt;comparable system costs $199&lt;/a&gt; for a three-pack. Vilo is also selling a single standalone router for $19, compared to $79 with Eero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmKtj"&gt;As you might expect, Vilo’s affordable pricing means you’re not getting top-of-the-line specs. There’s no Wi-Fi 6 here, so it’s not ready for the next-generation standard, and it’s also dual-band rather than tri-band, meaning it lacks the extra 5GHz band that other systems use to provide better communication between their routers and satellites. Each base station has three gigabit-Ethernet ports for wired devices, and there’s an app to enable features like guest networks and automatic alerts when unrecognized devices attempt to connect to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7OgzHQPErb3zWNCyTiPc-6Efayo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703079/Single_Unit_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vilo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each router has three ethernet sockets for wired connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="36qLZw"&gt;The company’s positioning is similar to Wyze, which has grown its brand by offering internet-connected security cameras at more affordable prices than established brands like Ring and Nest. The functionality of Wyze’s cameras often isn’t as slick as its more expensive competitors, but they’re an okay option if you’re working with a tight budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv5xUR"&gt;Vilo’s promise of up to 4,500 square feet of coverage is just a fraction smaller than the 5,000 square feet promised by Eero’s $199 system, but Vilo also says its system can handle up to 120 connected devices, while Eero claims a more modest “50+.” Vilo also claims a hefty maximum speed of 1.2Gbps, versus 350Mbps from Eero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGYPuZ"&gt;But theoretical performance often falls short in real-world usage. We also have questions about &lt;a href="https://www.viloliving.com/terms-of-service"&gt;Vilo’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that it “may include advertisements” in its services. When asked, a spokesperson for the company said the clause is to allow Vilo to run ads for its own products in its app or website, and said the company will never sell its user data to third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39VNy2"&gt;Potential drawbacks aside, $59 is remarkably cheap for a three-device mesh Wi-Fi system. It could make Vilo a tempting alternative for anyone building out a home network on a budget. Vilo’s mesh Wi-Fi system is available &lt;a href="https://www.viloliving.com/"&gt;direct from its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
