    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 foldable phone just got $200 cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQWphspry895a1K8QTAAZaRLqfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067145/vpavic_200907_4181_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvTWM2"&gt;Samsung is dropping the price of its ultra-premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G&lt;/a&gt; by $200, bringing the foldable smartphone &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/preview/5d6ef31c-d5e1-4577-86ca-3587c4c936df?large"&gt;down to $1,799.99&lt;/a&gt; compared to its initial $1,999.99 launch MRSP. Even after the price cut, the Z Fold 2 5G will still cost you more than flagships from pretty much all of Samsung’s competitors, but it’s perhaps the best folding phone yet — and it certainly offers functionality that traditional handsets can’t match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9oFCyS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Z Fold 2 review: an extravagant success|95267" data-volume-uuid="ba0c11907" data-volume-id="95267" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-1" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AbuHMN"&gt;The new lower price is available for &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the unlocked model&lt;/a&gt; as well as carrier versions of the Z Fold 2 5G from Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. Remember that Samsung is also now giving buyers of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Z Flip 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297877/samsung-galaxy-z-fold2-z-flip-return-100-days-foldables-buy-and-try"&gt;an extended 100-day return policy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a show of confidence in this wave of foldables after the original Galaxy Fold got off to an infamously rocky start. Things got much better with the Z Fold 2 5G, which exudes quality that comes much closer to matching its cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgSoj9"&gt;Along with the reduced price, Samsung is introducing a referral program for Galaxy Z owners. If you already own one of Samsung’s latest folding phones and have sold someone else on buying in, you can give them a referral code that’ll save them $100 off their purchase and earn you $100 in credit at Samsung’s online store. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft won’t fully reopen its offices until September 7th at the earliest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qL5CBer0CsFV_jIh6vdQIi1OzcM=/27x0:920x595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066813/microsoftstock.0.0.1430145467.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bprXun"&gt;Microsoft is delaying the full reopening of its offices — the company’s “Stage 6” phase of its hybrid workplace plan — until September 7th at the earliest. This marks a delay from its originally planned July window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag16mY"&gt;“Based on our continued consultation with health and data experts, we’ve shifted our earliest date for the full opening of our U.S. worksites to September 7, 2021. We continue to review the situation on a local basis in each region/country/state where we work and will adjust dates by country as needed,” a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8oBKe1ZLHufCw8onyxAkhusZDWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22388422/rXHFyu8.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s hybrid workplace dial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nWnZz3"&gt;Microsoft executive vice president Kurt DelBene explained the decision to delay the full reopening in an &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-office-reopening-september-coronavirus-summer-plans-2021-4"&gt;email to staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “We believe this date will afford additional flexibility for employees to make summer plans, and we’ll continue to keep you updated if the date moves out.” Additionally, the email notes that Microsoft will give regional office leaders leeway to further push back that date, depending on health and safety conditions in their local area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mX3Php"&gt;The company has &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/22/the-philosophy-and-practice-of-our-hybrid-workplace/"&gt;already started to reopen in a limited capacity&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier in March, the company noted that roughly 20 percent of its staff worldwide were back in the office, and it started to slowly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace"&gt;reopen its Redmond and Seattle, Washington-based headquarters&lt;/a&gt; on March 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qbf3jY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft to start reopening headquarters on March 29th, with hybrid workplace focus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6DcH17"&gt;That said, the shift to a more remote workplace at Microsoft caused by the COVID-19 pandemic looks to be a permanent change to the company’s culture. Going forward, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508964/microsoft-remote-work-from-home-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;plans to make the option to work from home&lt;/a&gt; for up to 50 percent of the week standard for most positions, with the option to discuss more substantial shifts to remote work with managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fj1AWv"&gt;“The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all of us to think, live, and work in new ways,” says Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s chief people officer, explained in a note last October. “We will offer as much flexibility as possible to support individual workstyles, while balancing business needs, and ensuring we live our culture.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: WWDC rumors, Clubhouse competition, and the cookiepocalypse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ImdIdIa4RQmHOha3iu0cbhMxLvI=/0x52:1472x1033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066606/hero_m1_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urvyXL"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obF0zU"&gt;This week, Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;deputy editor Dan Seifert about this week’s rumors about the next big Apple product announcements after invites were sent out for the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;annual WWDC event&lt;/a&gt;, which will again be virtual-only. After more &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-to-have-ultra-short-focal-length-lenses-and-weigh-less-than-150-grams/"&gt;AR headset leaks&lt;/a&gt;, the crew also discusses whether Apple has the bandwidth to support all of its product categories, especially with the Apple TV left alone for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivet70"&gt;Later in the show, senior reporter Ashley Carman joins to discuss her coverage of social audio platform Clubhouse. Recently, we’ve seen a rise in potential competition in the social audio space from already-established platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505519/slack-instagram-stories-push-to-talk-audio-calls-new-features"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;. Ashley analyzes whether there is a winner-takes-all scenario or a more segmented space dedicated to genres of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUdJLu"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in the show — like Dieter’s explanation of the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;cookiepocalypse&lt;/a&gt;” brought by Google Chrome’s changes to ad tracking on the browser — so listen to the full discussion here or on your preferred podcast player to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summer Game Fest returns in June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoXgesfp1jRckXYhtXXukm1I-Y8=/0x13:995x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066487/Screen_Shot_2021_04_01_at_8.02.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Summer Game Fest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0VEDa"&gt;Summer Game Fest, which debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; as a digital “celebration” of video games with news, events, and playable content, is returning this year, kicking off in June. We don’t know much about what to expect just yet, but “the roster of participating publishers and developers, along with an event schedule outline, will be revealed in the coming weeks,” according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glAQjW"&gt;One thing is already on the agenda, though. There will be a Day of the Devs: Summer Game Fest Edition, which will “digitally spotlight a select group of upcoming indie and AAA video games.” Day of the Devs will be curated by Geoff Keighley and the &lt;a href="http://dayofthedevs.com/"&gt;Day of the Devs team&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of Double Fine Productions and iam8bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R02UW"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic remains a threat worldwide, forcing big gaming events once again to operate differently than in years past. The Entertainment Software Association says it is “transforming” its E3 conference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272758/e3-2021-digial-dates-announcement-esa"&gt;for its return this year&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly as a &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/e3s-2021-digital-event-could-be-partially-behind-a-paywall/"&gt;digital event&lt;/a&gt;. And the Game Developers Conference shifted into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290109/gdc-digital-only-masterclass-showcase-2021"&gt;three separate online events&lt;/a&gt;, with the traditional business and education-focused event taking place during the week of July 19th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s MLB The Show 21 will arrive on Xbox Game Pass at launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T63qUTJ0WcbLCiGfgdPYnjC55c=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066387/MLB_TheShow.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rz45cr"&gt;We already knew &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21 &lt;/em&gt;would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260091/mlb-the-show-21-playstation-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date"&gt;the first entry in the Sony-published series to arrive on Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt;. And today, Microsoft revealed the next entry in the long-running baseball franchise will also be &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/02/mlb-the-show-21-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-day-one/"&gt;available on Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for consoles when the game releases on April 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMN9p6"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/02/mlb-the-show-21-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-day-one/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S versions will be playable on Microsoft’s video game subscription service. The game will also be available on Android devices via xCloud, which is available at no additional cost if you are subscribed to the pricier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwlM6l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt; is a huge win for Xbox owners. In the past, the series has been exclusive to PlayStation platforms, while competitors released for Xbox have &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/4/17191164/rbi-baseball-18-review"&gt;never quite become true contenders&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Show&lt;/em&gt;. Game Pass is already home to a handful of longtime sports franchises and now includes the latest entries in the &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/03/nba-2k21-coming-soon-xbox-game-pass/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/03/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-march-wave-1-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;NHL &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MGE0ld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MLB The Show is coming to both PlayStation and Xbox consoles on April 20th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260091/mlb-the-show-21-playstation-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is $75 at several retailers today</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbdJCk"&gt;Easter is on Sunday, and if you celebrate the holiday but won’t be able to visit your family this year, a Zoom call is a great substitute to ensure you can still connect with your loved ones. A few devices support Zoom, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;including Amazon’s Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, which is on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="uhKwuI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GWOeX6"&gt;Amazon is also discounting its Fire HD 8 tablets, knocking $30 off the usual retail prices. You can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 tablet for only $60&lt;/a&gt;, or you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 Plus for $80&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the previous Fire HD 8 models, the latest tablets have a USB-C port for faster charging, and the HD 8 Plus supports wireless charging, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O0hIwm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Kara Verlaney on copy editing and its tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qxhE0te8X6VuzA6JdvIY9ZomC7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066184/kverlaney_210401_4504_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kara Verlaney / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWvn42"&gt;You may come across the occasional writer who will claim (wrongly) that they don’t need an editor, but you will seldom, if ever, meet a writer or editor who will say they don’t need a copy editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVM1Eu"&gt;The role of a copy editor is often misunderstood or underestimated by those not in the business. Kara Verlaney, senior copy editor for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, when asked to explain the role of a copy editor, put it this way: “Copy editing is about maintaining consistency and accuracy, which is what gives sites like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the authority to tell our audience about a subject. Beyond checking for grammatical errors and extolling the Oxford comma, copy editors also monitor things like sensitivity and tone, style, source diversity, and clarity. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s process has copy editors checking pieces right before publish, so we’re often the last line of defense before something goes up on the site.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvOmGs"&gt;We talked to Kara to find out how she does her job and what tools she uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="iakOVm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10420457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdauBB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your job at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6X8omK"&gt;I’m a senior copy editor, and I’ve worked here for five years. My day-to-day responsibilities vary, but a large portion of my time is dedicated to editing... everything we publish. That includes news stories, longform features, Instagram captions, video assets — there are a lot of words! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VydzlL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What hardware tools do you use? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6Ib4k"&gt;My sound preferences vary depending on the length and / or topic of the piece I’m editing. Sometimes I blast music; sometimes I enjoy silence while I read. While working remotely, I mostly rely on my AirPods Pro, which allow me to control the level of noise transparency. I also tend to move around my space a lot while I work, so I’m essentially glued to my 2019 MacBook Pro during the workday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JKYcJK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uaX2al"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What software tools do you and your colleagues use for your work? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6ZWrs"&gt;Various publications have created stylebooks to guide writers and editors — examples include &lt;em&gt;The Chicago Manual of Style&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;MLA Handbook&lt;/em&gt;. Each stylebook’s rules and formats differ slightly based on the content and audience, but consistency is universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3ExN7"&gt;Like many news organizations, our style largely follows &lt;a href="https://apstylebook.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; Stylebook&lt;/a&gt; (otherwise known as the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;). Its online topical style guides and Ask the Editor sections can be great language resources (although sometimes the answers are confounding). &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s default dictionary is &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/"&gt;Merriam-Webster’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Unabridged&lt;/a&gt;. It produces &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-games"&gt;weekly vocabulary quizzes&lt;/a&gt; that are super fun, if that’s your thing. I have &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; and M-W open at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cL2S0R"&gt;I do a majority of my editing in Google Docs or Vox Media’s CMS (content management system) Chorus, so I can leave comments and track changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4pe7sb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425606"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="trYFaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other tools do you use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkFwgm"&gt;One facet of managing the copy desk is updating and maintaining &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s style guide and communicating those rules to writers. Some of our house style is unique to our publication, so we differ somewhat from &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; style. Language is constantly evolving and changing, so I need to stay on top of what other publications and style guides are doing to ensure our language stays relevant and inclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9vbDQ"&gt;I love using physical style manuals — any time I can avoid staring at a screen, I do! — but most of my hard copies are still gathering dust at the office. I did bring one home with me, though: Strunk and White’s &lt;em&gt;Elements of Style, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is essentially the lifeblood of any editor. The illustrated edition pictured at the top of this article was given to me as a gift, particularly due to its cover. (As my co-workers will tell you, I solicit pictures of dogs and other pets as a form of emotional currency.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUBArJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice do you have for people who are considering copy editing as a profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMjqAP"&gt;Being a copy editor is a very involved job. You have to communicate well with the writers, editors, and creators you work with; operate efficiently under some tight deadlines; and try to understand the essence of every story you read, cataloging some of that information to reference later. It’s fairly nuanced work for being so prescriptive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uifrVO"&gt;I’d recommend reading as much as you can and refreshing your grammar skills. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; creates &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/insider/copy-edit-this-quiz.html"&gt;copy edit quizzes&lt;/a&gt;; I’ve gotten a perfect score on very few.) There are also tools like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grammarly.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22358493%2Fcopy-edit-tools-tech-airpods-stylebook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; that will highlight and explain various parts of speech and language rules, which some people find really helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i73pDT"&gt;Mostly, you need a willingness to relearn (and unlearn) a bunch of rules you were probably taught in fourth grade English class. Language is learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGQfjM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s Base Station Pro wireless charger is half price this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DsuKDODs7tDjNpqN6nVJl3O-sI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066043/cgartenberg_200824_4157_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpGgFA"&gt;Nomad’s well-designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a Qi wireless charger that can charge up to three devices simultaneously — perfect if you have a phone, watch, and earbuds. If its $200 price tag has been a stumbling block, Nomad is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeDealExclusiveApril2021&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-station-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50 percent discount on the charger&lt;/a&gt; until Sunday, April 4th, at 2:59AM ET (Saturday at 11:59PM PT if you’re on the West Coast). To get this price, enter the code &lt;strong&gt;VOX &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. If you have an Apple Watch, you can also add the Apple Watch attachment for $5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NuQVzZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e2exU5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;My colleague Chaim Gartenberg reviewed the Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt; when it released in August 2020. What makes this different from most other Qi wireless charging pads are its Aira FreePower coils, which allow for a better connection to your device’s own charging coil. Traditional coils tend to generate more energy and heat than is necessary to recharge your tech, but that’s another way Aira’s tech inside of the Base Station Pro differs. Chaim says in his review that “it’s practically impossible to miss when placing your phone down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4L1OG"&gt;There are a few things you should know before taking the plunge with this deal: if you’re charging, say, an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time, they’ll all recharge at 5W, which is the slowest standard speed. With just an iPhone, it can reach up to 7.5W. Though anything else (even Android devices that support fast Qi charging) will be limited to 5W. Lastly, Nomad says on the product page that the MagSafe magnets built into the iPhone 12 series drastically reduce the charging efficiency of the Base Station Pro. It expects the iPhone 12 mini to recharge in about eight hours, with the bigger iPhone 12 Pro Max taking about nine and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse defined a format — now it has to defend it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJVNqCTU6a8hXZj6j9VJ0-mmNns=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065999/VRG_ILLO_4505_Clubhouse.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1CqRy"&gt;Clubhouse had an incredible year in one most of us would rather forget. The live audio app launched during a pandemic; gained more than 10 million downloads for an invite-only, iOS-only app; and succeeded to the point that most every social platform wants to copy it. Congrats to Clubhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOkwwx"&gt;The company now faces its biggest challenges yet, however. For one, the pandemic is waning, and people might be more interested in real-life socializing instead of conversations facilitated through their phone. Anyone advertising their backyard as the next great Clubhouse competitor has a point. But for the people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; end up wanting to talk to each other online, they’ll soon have a lot more places to do so. In case you haven’t kept up: Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (reportedly), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; have all launched or are working on their own attempts at social audio — the space is about to get busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1JABh"&gt;The great concern for Clubhouse is that, as I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1360387683659481088"&gt;postulated&lt;/a&gt; in February, social audio could follow the same trajectory as Snapchat’s Stories function: a brilliant social media-altering idea that goes on to live in every app to the detriment of the upstart that pioneered the format. And social audio is shaping up to go that way. With the threat growing, it’s worth looking at where Clubhouse is most likely to run into problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NabghB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Social audio will likely follow the same trajectory as stories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EuYMsv"&gt;But first: what does Clubhouse have going for it? It was the first to social audio, and that’s something. Already, it counts millions of users who come to Clubhouse solely for social audio content, and that includes headline-grabbing names like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other celebrities. Tech CEOs are even making announcements in Clubhouse, including Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield, who announced his company’s own copycat product in the app. The app generates news and discussions — that’s something much trickier for other companies to clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oB6Czr"&gt;People have also built habits around Clubhouse, which is a positive sign for user retention. The team also plans to launch a creators program in the near future that’ll reward its most dedicated users with revenue and resources to beef up their shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53A0Mr"&gt;And critically, the app has staffed up in just the past month. The company recently poached Fadia Kader from Instagram to lead its media partnerships and creators. At Instagram, she worked with musicians to help them optimize their work on the platform. Presumably, she’ll be doing something similar at Clubhouse. Already, I’ve seen her in a room with Justin Bieber talking about his most recent album. Clubhouse also hired Maya Watson from Netflix to become its head of global marketing, meaning it’ll soon dedicate resources to promoting Clubhouse rather than relying primarily on word of mouth. These are all important steps to keeping Clubhouse interesting and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZeloFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse is staffing up and working on an Android app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHedN"&gt;But the app now faces competition from some of the world’s biggest platforms, which already have years of moderation experience, are available on iOS and Android, and have massive, loyal user bases to whom they can push social audio. Some companies, like Twitter and Discord, already pushed social audio features live to their millions of users with effectively the same interface as Clubhouse. Anyone who didn’t have an invite to Clubhouse, or an iPhone, now can access the magic of social audio with no association to Clubhouse whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pX5c6j"&gt;Maybe the most dangerous possibility for Clubhouse, however, is how easily it could lose the big names on its platform to challengers. Spotify, which announced this week that it acquired Betty Labs, the maker of the sports-centric social audio app Locker Room, plans to bring the app to Android, change its name, and broaden its coverage to music, culture, and sports. It could directly compete with Clubhouse for talent. Joe Rogan, for example, recently joined a Clubhouse chat, and although Spotify’s head of R&amp;amp;D &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;tells me&lt;/a&gt; the company won’t restrict its podcasters from using other social audio apps, it’s easy to imagine the company encouraging the use of its own. Musicians, like Bieber, who maybe came to Clubhouse to debut music, might turn to Spotify’s app instead to maintain relationships with the streaming giant. As a point of reference, when Kylie Jenner &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/snapchat-update-kylie-jenner/index.html"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that she barely opened Snapchat anymore, the company’s stock lost $1.3 billion. If stars like Tiffany Haddish decide to spend their time elsewhere, Clubhouse will falter, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeeVn3"&gt;At the same time, a few of these competitors are specifically interested in building native recording into their app, possibly to fuel the podcasting ecosystem and on-demand listening. Clubhouse has yet to do this. Fireside, which was co-founded by Mark Cuban, allows people to input sound effects, like music, and record their shows for distribution across podcasting platforms, as well as later playback on the app itself. Spotify will likely do the same with its app and rely on its Anchor software to handle hosting and distribution. Twitter’s head of consumer product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321158/twitter-spaces-record-conversation-kayvon-beykpour"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it, too, would let people natively record their Spaces. Clubhouse hasn’t built that functionality, limiting its users to only live conversations, which can be hard to follow if they join them midway through. Context collapse will challenge every platform that focuses on live, but some of Clubhouse’s competitors are already working to solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rmHowe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse’s competitors already have Android apps and are looking into native recording functions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="szy5IN"&gt;Stories made Snapchat a success. It pioneered the idea of ephemeral content and brought some semblance of authenticity back to social media. But it didn’t take long for the functionality to come to the same competitors Clubhouse now faces. To make its business work, Snapchat doubled down on its Android app, made the app more approachable to new users through a redesign, and aggressively pursued content partnerships with media and entertainment companies. It now pays users to make content for its TikTok competitor Spotlight and supports a growing ad business, but Instagram ultimately came away with the crown for Stories. Clubhouse hasn’t yet pursued ads or subscriptions, but that’ll be the next step to make it a self-supported platform. (Notably, though, its competitors, like Facebook, already rule ad targeting, possibly making Clubhouse’s job of selling ads or access to the platform itself tougher.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMHLd1"&gt;None of this is to say Clubhouse won’t survive or build a strong business in the coming months and years. It just needs to stay in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAemQF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 2nd, 2021: 9:47AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; GameStop has sold all of the stock available for its three PS5 bundles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFuyG"&gt;If you have been keeping up with PS5 news, you will know that it is nearly impossible to find this console right now because of the short supply and mostly online-only sales. If you don’t mind buying a bundle, which includes additional items alongside the PS5, GameStop has restocked &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-with-ps-plus-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225171T.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-spider-man-ultimate-edition-and-call-of-duty-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170F.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-action-collection-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170G.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundles&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ8ICJ"&gt;There are two bundles we found that may be worth a buy if you are interested in what each package contains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tkmAH"&gt;The PS5 Digital Edition bundle — which includes the console, plus one-year subscriptions for PS Plus and PS Now, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card — is selling for $600, or about $200 more than the console alone goes for. Purchasing all of these items individually would tally up to the same $600, so you’re not forced into a marked-up price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9QOBwi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-spider-man-ultimate-edition-and-call-of-duty-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170F.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second bundle costs $730&lt;/a&gt;. At that price, it nets you one PS5 with a disc drive, two $70 games (&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ultimate Launch Edition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War)&lt;/em&gt;, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card. Normally, all this stuff would retail for roughly $720 before tax, so there is a small price increase if you were to buy these items separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TPl5cX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcHuE8"&gt;There is also a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-action-collection-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170G.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third bundle up for sale today at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. For $760, you get the following: a PS5 console, which includes the disc drive; three games (&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;), an extra controller, plus a $20 gift card to GameStop. Adding up all these items together separately retails for about the same, so there’s no price gouging going on here, assuming you want all of these add ons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RWStGn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HRiiTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1uqxNf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
