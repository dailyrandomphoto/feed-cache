    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DC2jOd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;coming on May 7th&lt;/a&gt;, but if you have been keeping up with the news surrounding the game, you may have heard about Lady Dimitrescu, a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tall woman who has become &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/15/22233028/resident-evil-village-capcom-preview-fans-love-big-vampire-lady"&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; popular on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. There have been a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daniellednicola/status/1354231556265680898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354231556265680898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosplaycentral.com%2Ftopics%2Fcosplay%2Fnews%2Fthis-lady-dimitrescu-cosplay-from-resident-evil-village-is-stunning"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hellyvalentine_/status/1365330999731752963?s=20"&gt;cosplayers&lt;/a&gt; who’ve attempted to re-create the iconic villain, but the most recent cosplay from Yekaterina Lisina is arguably the best yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1mdc3"&gt;Lisina, a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/28/worlds-tallest-model-no-one-cares-about-my-basketball-career/"&gt;former Olympian-turned-model&lt;/a&gt;, recently shared some content on Instagram of her cosplaying Lady Dimitrescu, even going so far as to re-create a parody of one of the trailers for the game. But don’t take my word for it, just check out the video she shared on her Instagram page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0CoPYi"&gt;Lisina stands at 6 feet, 9 inches tall — which, fun fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261405/resident-evil-village-tall-lady-dimitrescu-height"&gt;is the inverse height of the actual character&lt;/a&gt;, according to the game’s art director. This isn’t the only content we’ve seen from Lisina cosplaying as the character: she also posted a TikTok a few days ago of her in the outfit. Outside of cosplaying as the latest &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil &lt;/em&gt;antagonist, Lisina also &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLJHO3kBxRQ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;cosplayed as Princess Peach&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CfQSj"&gt;And now, I shall patiently wait to see if someone on the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; development team notices Lisina’s cosplay because I really want to know what their reaction is. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Original Xbox and Xbox 360 games arrive on Microsoft’s xCloud streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2oAFdjKAjR5sKdZsXeTKr1B3xM=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054377/xcloudxbox360games.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfmC2P"&gt;Microsoft is bringing 16 original Xbox and Xbox 360 games to the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service today. Titles like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&lt;/em&gt;, the original &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt; are all now available to stream to Android devices. Microsoft is also enabling touch controls for &lt;em&gt;Jetpac Refuelled&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Viva Pinata&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Viva Pinata TIP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTNyKM"&gt;The 16 games will be available to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members and streamable to Android phones and tablets. “We’ve listened to the feedback, going all the way back to our earliest cloud gaming preview, and making games from previous generations available on mobile devices has been one of the most requested features by the community,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/31/backward-compatibility-reaches-the-clouds-for-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-members/"&gt;says Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9g0FY"&gt;Microsoft is also still planning to extend xCloud game streaming to iOS this spring. The software maker hasn’t revealed exactly when its iOS preview will go live, but Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;previously promised&lt;/a&gt; both iOS and web browser streaming for xCloud in spring 2021. Game streaming will be available in the Xbox app for Windows 10 PCs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ly0zwB"&gt;We got an early look at how xCloud will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304762/microsoft-xcloud-app-windows-xbox-touch-controls-gyro-support"&gt;work on Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; last month, alongside an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;exclusive first look at the web version of the service&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also testing 1080p streams for xCloud, and this will likely debut with the Windows version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o50xjZ"&gt;For now, here are the original Xbox and Xbox 360 games making their way to Xbox Cloud Gaming today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YJmXGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pJ1XcD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Tooie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uEZV1t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double Dragon Neon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pGYcfK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fable II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yig9FW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="50YGsT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OmnC4c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MZpXQZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War: Judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G0lEwQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpac Refuelled (touch controls enabled)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bKx9XS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kameo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nmwDhR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qiOcTW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11iKnO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8VmEvm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LRMHvL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Viva Piñata&lt;/em&gt; (touch controls enabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AH7JwK"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Viva Piñata: TIP&lt;/em&gt; (touch controls enabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Zola’s first trailer is as over-the-top as the Twitter thread it’s based on</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThvXQI"&gt;Social media has produced plenty of stories that have a ring of truth but are packed with ridiculous twists that seem way too good to be true. Thus it was with #TheStory, a &lt;a href="https://shadowandact.com/heres-a-recap-of-the-epic-zola-twitter-tale-and-the-actors-who-could-star-in-the-upcoming-movie-adaptation"&gt;148-part Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; by Aziah “Zola” Wells King — except her thread turned out to be a &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; true recounting of two women on a nightmare Florida road trip. Last year at the Sundance Film Festival, director Janicza Bravo turned that thread into a film that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21082396/zola-thestory-viral-twitter-thread-film-review-sundance-2020"&gt;dramatizes the story&lt;/a&gt; without losing Zola’s sardonic charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTxoff"&gt;A24 is now releasing &lt;em&gt;Zola&lt;/em&gt; in theaters this summer, and the first trailer was released online today. It’s a pretty good encapsulation of the movie, starring Taylour Paige as the semi-fictionalized A’Ziah King and Riley Keough as her volatile frenemy Stefani, who drags Zola into a trafficking underworld after inviting her on a spontaneous strip club tour. Also, don’t miss &lt;em&gt;Succession’s&lt;/em&gt; Nicholas Braun — who plays Stefani’s hapless boyfriend — bragging about “schmoney.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shorted video creators thousands of dollars in ad revenue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A dollar sign broken into small pieces revealing the Facebook logo at the center." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQCRelR4F1g62EUe_Zc6dx62ZL4=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054147/VRG_ILLO_4497_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Due to a ‘technical issue’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="obIJM4"&gt;Britain Lockhart never knows what he’ll find when he scuba dives for treasure. Neither do his viewers on Facebook who tune in for a surprise reveal. His page, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Depthsofhistory"&gt;Depths of History&lt;/a&gt;, has been steadily growing on the social network since he started posting videos there about two years ago. He now has 70,000 followers on his page, which has started generating thousands of dollars a month in ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn2bRx"&gt;“I really didn’t think it would be that profitable at all, but Facebook has such a variety of users on their interface that don’t even use YouTube, but they’ll be on Facebook,” he says, adding that he’ll post his YouTube videos on Facebook to make ad revenue on both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZmKPe"&gt;His income varies, although he says he’ll typically make between $2,000 and $3,000 per month through Facebook. But in 2021 so far, that income has unexpectedly dried up. The January payout was only $931, leaving him thousands of dollars short. In February, it was even lower, coming in at just $664. He double-checked his creator backend, and the numbers didn’t make sense there, either. Facebook’s revenue estimation tool projected that he should have received $3,397 for January and $1,747.52 for February. When the checks came in, he ended more than $4,000 short&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVJvPk"&gt;“It was like a slap in the face,” Lockhart says. “I was looking forward to buying more camera gear to increase my business, buying things that could prolong me working with Facebook and me working with YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LqXHa5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lockhart is owed thousands of dollars from two months of shorted payouts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqQjcQ"&gt;And he’s not the only one who hasn’t been entirely paid out. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with two other Facebook video creators, all of whom say the company shorted them on cash and ignored their requests for help. The creators had no reason to initially question the amount they were paid since Facebook’s estimated revenue tool almost always mirrored their actual payouts. Usually, they’d be short only a couple hundred dollars. But after their revenue seemed off two months in a row, the creators say they looked into the issue. All three say the problems began in January, around the time Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/introducing-the-new-page-experience/"&gt;transitioned&lt;/a&gt; to its new Pages experience and made updates to how creators can monetize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHQKCX"&gt;The sudden change is particularly alarming because of Facebook’s ambiguous approach to revenue-sharing in general. The company’s core business has always been direct, targeted advertising, but Facebook now sees an opportunity in sharing revenue with video creators, along the lines of YouTube or Twitch. Facebook has courted all sorts of creators — gamers, writers, and video hosts — through broader monetization options, like in-stream ads, shopping, and even subscription newsletters. It’s still unclear how many creators are on Facebook, but the strategy seems to be somewhat working. Facebook says there are more than 1 million shops across its app and Instagram, and that from 2019 to 2020, the number of content creators on Facebook earning the equivalent of $10,000 USD per month grew 88 percent, and creators earning $1,000 per month grew 94 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2kgkn"&gt;But these creators say Facebook only cares about advertisers, leaving them with no one to turn to when their payments are unexpectedly short. They reached out for help, but the company gave them no feedback on what could be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uypqYn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The payout problems started when creators switched to the new Pages experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdWFag"&gt;After &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reached out for comment, however, Facebook said it “resolved a technical issue that prevented a small number of video creators on Facebook from receiving their full in-stream ads payouts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsKYtL"&gt;“We’re notifying these partners that they’ll receive those remaining in-stream payments during the April payout cycle, and we apologize for any inconvenience,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTmM1e"&gt;It’s good news for the creators getting a rebate but still an alarming precedent — holding thousands of dollars back for months with little explanation or guarantee the same problem won’t pop up again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rWL1V"&gt;Volodymyr Popkov, the creator of the page &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/paintifyinspiration/"&gt;Painting Inspiration&lt;/a&gt;, which demos acrylic paint art tutorials, suggests that Facebook doesn’t value the creators who make the platform thrive. “They have live chat Facebook support for the people who spend money for the ads, who bring [Facebook] their money, but for people who are like us, the creators, they owe us money right now, and they’re not doing anything,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ggkdH"&gt;Facebook estimated that Popkov would get $13,000 in January, he says, but he only received $4,600. In February, he was estimated to receive $29,000 but made only $6,400. He knows the number is just an estimate, but he says he hasn’t seen any change in the numbers of viewers on his videos — at least not enough to explain a $32,000 shortfall. It’s a particular problem because Popkov employs artists to make artwork for the page. His Facebook income serves as payroll for them, along with his revenue from YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ekgBGt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook confirmed that a “technical issue” is to blame&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IzItpm"&gt;Another creator, Erik Reed, of the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/OutdoorswithErik"&gt;Outdoors With Erik&lt;/a&gt; page, says he’s owed over $10,000, going off the estimate tools. He specifically joined Facebook because other creators told him the monetization options and engagement levels were worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKJcg"&gt;Facebook has a long history of shoddy metrics causing problems for partners. Earlier this month, court documents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289232/facebook-ad-revenue-proposed-reach-inflation-lawsuit-unredacted-filings"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook provided advertisers with “inflated and misleading” metrics for years on how many people their ads were reaching. The company apparently knew that the reach of these ads was amplified by fake and duplicate accounts, but chose not to delete them. A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that this reach tool provided only “an estimate,” although Facebook allegedly knew advertisers based decisions around the metric. The company also previously faced a lawsuit that claimed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989712/facebook-inaccurate-video-metrics-inflation-lawsuit"&gt;knowingly overestimated&lt;/a&gt; how much video content users watched. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-reaches-proposed-settlement-in-video-measurement-lawsuit-11570482031"&gt;settled the suit&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTey8e"&gt;The creators who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have all diversified away from Facebook to avoid being overdependent on one platform; they all run YouTube channels along with their Facebook Pages as well as with other social pages. For the revenue-sharing model to work, Facebook needs creators to stay happy and posting. But increasingly, creators are skeptical of the company’s incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="51SOLh"&gt;“Working with platforms is hard,” Popkov says. “And you’re not working on your [own] platform, so it’s not like I can trust them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The unsettling surveillance of anti-Asian racism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmOdyvN_CLnQBvoxQJZfbm5Tuys=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69053805/VRG_ILLO_4493_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The rise of assaults on the elderly, captured on security camera footage, raises questions about policing and what really keeps people safe&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q2KYkl"&gt;The video opens on a sunny Oakland street corner, where two men are walking down the sidewalk. The way they move, the composition of their bodies, suggests they don’t know each other. Their stances will feel familiar to anyone used to sharing city streets with strangers. The man in front appears older, walking with deliberate caution, when the other approaches quickly from behind and gives him one vigorous shove. The motion is swift, dispassionate. As the older man falls to the ground, the assailant bounds back with inverse force, releasing his hands above his head in what could be a display of triumph — or merely a reflex — before strolling out of the frame. The clip ends at five seconds, the old man lying still on the concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGyENZ"&gt;The whole thing is abrupt and sudden. Maybe you’ve seen it, autoplayed on loop, almost like a GIF, as it moves through your timelines. It was first shared by ABC7 San Francisco reporter Dion Lim on February 4th on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CK3K274gTsx/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DionLimTV/status/1357410040462733312"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and an article &lt;a href="https://abc7news.com/shocking-video-shows-man-pushed-to-ground-in-oaklands-chinatown/10311111/"&gt;titled&lt;/a&gt; “Shocking video shows 91-year-old man senselessly pushed to ground in Oakland’s Chinatown.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtX9ZO"&gt;In under 24 hours, Lim’s video was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieldaekim/status/1357580443403567104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1357580443403567104%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabc7news.com%2Fman-pushed-to-ground-in-oakland-daniel-dae-kim-wu-violence%2F10316560%2F"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; by actor Daniel Dae Kim, who condemned the “skyrocketing number of hate crimes against Asian Americans” and offered a $25,000 reward “for information leading to the arrest and conviction of this man and his accomplices.” The next day, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf held a press conference in Chinatown, using recent attacks on Asian Americans as a political gambit, criticizing efforts to reduce the police budget. “I have not forgotten that this last summer,” she said, when local officials “brought a proposal to cut $25 million from the Oakland police department as a political statement, not because of operational or financial need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vHenCe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re under attack and this is reality.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W2b3S6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4SdCw"&gt;The video came at a timely moment: for over a year, “China virus” rhetoric had fueled anti-Asian street harassment and violent attacks that went largely ignored by mass media and the general public. Finally, Asian American activists, community leaders, and journalists were getting national attention on the issue. Four days later, the assailant was apprehended by the police. Because of his court records and history with “&lt;a href="https://oaklandside.org/2021/02/12/oakland-chinatown-policing-hate-crimes-community/"&gt;significant mental health issues&lt;/a&gt;,” he was not charged with a hate crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMmTEV"&gt;The victim, it later turned out, wasn’t Asian, but a Latino man named Gilbert Diaz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFuJ5x"&gt;The man who sent the footage of the attack to Lim was Carl Chan, who represents the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Chan, who has spent the past 30 years trying to give a voice to his community, is currently working on installing even more surveillance cameras to deter further assaults. “We’re under attack and this is reality,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “It didn’t happen yesterday. It’s been happening for so many years, but we just caught the national attention [now].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVgHt2"&gt;That attention from the videos, Chan hopes, will justify demands for more policing to combat anti-Asian violence — a sentiment shared by many Oakland Chinatown residents and which, as Kim’s $25,000 bounty suggests, is not isolated to the Bay Area. But calls for increased police presence are in direct opposition to last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests that sought to raise awareness of the over-policing of Black people. The conflict is troubling: increased surveillance and policing may appear to keep one community safer, while putting others in greater peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lpKCZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even evidence of racism toward Asians falls into stereotypes: distant, anonymous, dehumanized&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pd9EM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG9vpA"&gt;Violent footage from surveillance cameras has been effective in attracting national coverage of the rise of anti-Asian racism. And the viral reception of the videos has also flattened the conversation from one about decades of ongoing racial suffering to one centered on increasing policing, instead of how to effectively protect communities. And it appears the police know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAwCeB"&gt;Recordings of robberies and attacks are sent to the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce on a daily basis, Chan says. But when asked who sent him the video of Diaz’s attack, Chan demurred, growing defensive that I might not be here to report on the “real issues” but rather to make it an “anti-police story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyMnP3"&gt;He would not confirm where the video came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rj6ZV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lJzC7KjMMNzpYCz1r9Ue2IjLsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409151/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lB5Gvt"&gt;Just days before the video of Gilbert Diaz’s attack went viral on Twitter, a similar one capturing the killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee outside his San Francisco apartment made national headlines. Both were caught on surveillance cameras, and both show what appears to be one man coming up behind another and shoving them before rushing away. Never mind the fact of Diaz’s race. These two videos continue to be widely circulated as proof of the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, even though neither of them led to hate crime charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gw93B8"&gt;“They were saying that ‘we don’t see it.’ So with these videos, people are finally seeing that it’s actually happening,” Chan &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/03/21/social-media-surveillance-videos-silence-doubters-of-asian-american-attacks/"&gt;said to CBSN Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;. “The videos are doing justice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCzot9"&gt;These videos have come to exemplify what we might call a new genre of the anti-Asian hate crime media. They’re often sudden and impersonal — frequently taken from surveillance footage that often shows no other bodies around besides the assailant and the victim. These images stand in contrast to the many videos of police brutality against Black bodies, almost always filmed on phone cameras. The footage that captured the killings of Eric Garner and George Floyd follow an arc that’s familiar partly because we’ve seen it too many times — recordings that unfold with slow dread as we watch a Black man victimized by a racist police officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8vDMJo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every hate crime story is a policing story&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RX7qkv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrxKB7"&gt;The videos of assaults on Asian Americans present a different horror: you’re witness to a scene of brutal violence that is so swift as to appear almost random, meaningless. Watching these attacks, it’s often impossible to tell the race of any of the bodies involved. The sound is often garbled, if there is any sound to be heard at all. Even evidence of racism toward Asians falls into stereotypes: distant, anonymous, dehumanized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aScWw1"&gt;The most recent viral video capturing &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/nyregion/attack-asian-woman-midtown.html"&gt;the attack of a 65-year-old Asian woman&lt;/a&gt; represents an escalation of this genre. The violence is even more brutal, but just as harrowing is the reluctance of building staff to intervene. One finally responds by shutting the door on the woman. (The building managers quickly responded in a public statement by condemning and firing these workers.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4H6RfS"&gt;The NYPD is investigating whether the assault was a targeted hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Arjg3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sSVUbnu98GxUsOg3PnIhqaquikY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409096/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: New York City Police Department&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The attack of a 65-year-old woman was recorded in front of 360 West 43rd St. in Manhattan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qxC5WD"&gt;Every hate crime story is a policing story. After all, “hate crime” (sometimes known as “bias crime”) emerged as a new legal category in the 1980s to charge felons motivated by prejudice. Yet the term reflects an oversimplification of the phenomenon it seeks to describe, given that law enforcement hinges on whether they can “prove” the perpetrator’s “hate” toward a target group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4z0B8"&gt;This was recently made explicit when a gunman attacked three Asian spas in the Atlanta, Georgia, area, killing six Asian women in addition to two other victims, and it spurred international debates over whether the act was a hate crime. Captain Jay Baker, speaking on behalf of the Cherokee County Sheriff’s office, explained that the shooter was “not racially motivated” but by “a temptation… he wanted to eliminate.” Baker’s implication that a crime, particularly one targeting three different Asian massage spas, could not entail both racial and gendered bias prompted immediate backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGmPC9"&gt;“In Atlanta, you have the police,” University of Texas Austin history professor Eric Tang tells me, “these investigators who have known &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about racism, known &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about misogyny, known &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about Asian Americans, getting to determine and interpret what happened.” Which is all to say, as Tang puts it somberly, “that we’re not in a very good position, three decades down the line.” To that point, Baker was soon revealed to have posted images of T-shirts that read “Covid 19: imported virus from Chy-na” on social media and has since been removed from the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3i4H2V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The majority of crimes that are happening throughout the city are because people are desperate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j2i9Io"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCTjos"&gt;Hate crimes present problems of legibility. Notoriously difficult to convict, hate crime cases often backfire — causing further harm in their disavowal of prejudice. Failures in hate crime convictions can “really just reinforce that designation,” explains Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, “that there are certain groups that are acceptable targets for violence… because people don’t care as much about them,” which only further licenses the hate crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDWDsf"&gt;Even while the Cherokee County Sheriff’s office dismissed racial bias in the Atlanta shooting, local authorities did not hesitate in the immediate aftermath to send emergency patrols specifically to Asian neighborhoods, while police departments as far as Chicago and New York City also &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-spa-killings-police-patrols-asian-american-communities/story?id=76532692"&gt;stepped up patrolling&lt;/a&gt;. Just as opportunistic was Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who used the pretext of rising Chinatown attacks to take a swing at her political opponents and perhaps shift the reputational burden of policy. (Critics have repeatedly pointed out that the cuts to the police department decried by Schaaf came from her own administration.) Law enforcement and politicians alike are now banding together to weaponize attacks on Asian Americans Pacific Islanders (AAPI) to their own ends, often through highly spectacularized media events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l19u0j"&gt;Chaney Turner, a Black organizer who has lived in Oakland her entire life, sees the root cause of what is happening in her hometown as an issue of poverty. “Yes, there are some targeted crimes of people because of their race,” Turner explains, “but the majority of crimes that are happening throughout the city are because people are desperate. People are dealing with economic and mental health issues, and these are issues that we were experiencing before Covid.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8JPkA"&gt;Despite rising crime throughout Oakland during the COVID-19 pandemic, including Turner’s neighborhood in East Oakland, the mayor has focused on select communities like Oakland Chinatown. Some organizers like Chan are grateful for the attention: the policing of hate crimes offers the possibility of legitimizing the ongoing suffering and fear faced by many Asian Americans. Yet the punitive demands after anti-Asian attacks also go directly against the work of so many grassroots decriminalization efforts, some of which are AAPI-based like &lt;a href="http://apen4ej.org"&gt;APEN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/asians4abolition/?hl=en"&gt;Asians 4 Abolition&lt;/a&gt;, among &lt;a href="https://caasf.org/press-release/asian-organizations-across-the-bay-area-join-forces-to-demand-action-against-violence/"&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9eHow2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you only focus on hate crimes enforcement, then you’re only getting at a small slice of what’s happening out there.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwQqKM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8nDSB"&gt;As history and research have exhaustively shown, more policing will inevitably result in greater harm to Black and Latinx communities. Take, for example, New York City’s quota-driven &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/upshot/stop-and-frisk-bloomberg.html"&gt;stop-and-frisk program&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in increasing risks to vulnerable populations of anxiety, depression, struggles in school, and community engagement in civic life, without being particularly helpful in fighting crime. Faced with growing terror and limited options, however, some Asian communities now feel that they must choose to protect their own by turning to the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6elvw"&gt;Yet this false binary — between choosing or not choosing the police — is not a failure of the Asian community’s desire for safety, but a failure of policing. James Burch, policy director of the Anti Police-Terror Project, tells me about alternate models, unexplored by Schaaf, such as an ambassadorship program that provides “presence of safety” to communities. The choice, to him, doesn’t have to be how few or many police officers are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ou8KC"&gt;As with other Oakland organizers like Turner, Burch is also frustrated with how Schaaf has used the violence against Asians as a photo op. “What I can’t allow is our current mayor weaponizing the situation to divide Black and Asian communities at a time when we are and have been working so hard to unite them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfIoDw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJg-J3Rgk4kNubaVMMGfArVEBIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409135/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zp09fs"&gt;If proving anti-Asian racism has hinged on the hate crime, maybe the answer is to simply move away from the term and make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNSu7v"&gt;Founded in 1991, Asian Americans Advancing Justice launched the #StandAgainstHate platform in early 2017 in an effort to track “hate incidents,” as they’re called, against AAPI and Muslim communities that surged in the wake of Donald Trump’s election. Though it’s been the newer &lt;a href="https://stopaapihate.org/"&gt;Stop AAPI Hate&lt;/a&gt;, formed last March, that has garnered more recent media attention, with its rising record of hate incidents (the latest report counted 3,795) frequently cited across articles. Instead of hate crimes, Stop AAPI Hate co-founder Russell Jeung tells me, the broader category of hate incidents captures a range of events from online bullying to physical attacks that may not be criminally prosecutable but can still be traumatizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNIeoT"&gt;Almost 90 percent of the reports Stop AAPI Hate receives are incidents rather than crimes — in other words, forms of verbal harassment or shunning that are often overlooked when it comes to accounting for anti-Asian racism. “Unless you understand the comprehensive nature of racism in all its forms,” Jeung says, “you can’t really address it well. If you only focus on hate crimes enforcement, then you’re only getting at a small slice of what’s happening out there.” One of the questions Jeung wants to ask, however, is whether simply reporting the hate incident — &lt;em&gt;calling it what it is&lt;/em&gt; — might help reduce harm, even minimally. In contrast to hate crime data, Jeung hopes to develop “a collective voice” that expresses a different type of racial trauma — one Stop AAPI Hate plans to study by working with the Asian American Psychological Association in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iZieog"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even surveillance footage can ultimately obscure more than elucidate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6Ibkt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BgaSR"&gt;Yet because the accounting of this data remains unofficial and broadly defined, there is also always the problem, as sociologist Tamara K. Nopper &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7MNPXHT0wM"&gt;recently pointed out in a talk&lt;/a&gt;, of media literacy. Looking at Stop AAPI Hate’s data, which ranges from physical violence to shunning, Nopper asks, “What does it mean that the term hate encompasses all of these activities? And that hate is often being used interchangeably with violence?” As Stop AAPI Hate’s data keeps getting cited in news reports, Nopper warns, “this data source, as well as the hashtag, are part of what is kind of mobilizing this hate crime statistic collection; but also the passage for tougher legislation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq5uyp"&gt;While the vast majority of anti-Asian hate incidents have been documented in writing, it has been videos of explicit physical violence that have come to dominate and drive awareness of the phenomenon. In a culture where anti-Asian racism remains difficult to represent, footage promises something like incontrovertible evidence. Though, as the video of Diaz’s attack suggests, even surveillance footage can ultimately obscure more than elucidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYIxbN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RDDuLPkR9jJhK42jAN7DvnOVhjo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409150/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F0J6Vz"&gt;A month after the video of Diaz’s attack was released, I went down to Oakland Chinatown to try to see if I could find the specific surveillance camera on which it was captured. I did. It wasn’t hard. The camera was hidden in plain sight outside an unassuming Chinese tailor shop. Though when I went inside to ask whether they owned the camera, I was redirected to the Asian Resource Center next door, where a security guard told me that all of the cameras around the building belonged to the Oakland police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfswFI"&gt;The Oakland Police Department denied a records request for the video. After several emails with the department’s media office, a spokesperson responded but was unable to provide details of where the exact footage of Diaz’s attack came from. Instead, they informed me that the department does not technically &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; any cameras in Chinatown and that they were typically maintained by commercial or residential property owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg2Jkz"&gt;With this new information, I returned to Chinatown in hopes of clarifying who exactly did own the surveillance camera. Back at the Asian Resource Center, a different security guard told me that, while he had no idea who managed the security system around the building, he was pretty sure the police had access. As to who owned the surveillance cameras? This security guard wasn’t sure about that either, but he suggested I try property management. I’d put in a call to building management a month ago, and they also would not confirm if the footage had been given to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhRlpP"&gt;No one would claim responsibility for the footage, and yet, just last week, it played during a Fox News interview with Schaaf, cited alongside Ratanapakdee’s attack as examples of why Oakland needs to restore “desperately needed police services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fhWl5c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Asians are seen as inoffensive, weak, vulnerable, and therefore, can be picked on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pAnnzC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AYxEM"&gt;Toward the end of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s interview with Chan, he apologized for his earlier defensiveness around questions about the provenance of the footage. Moving away from the individual video of Diaz, Chan started talking about all of the other videos he’d received that he was unable to forward to the media. Oftentimes, it’s because the subjects involved want to protect their privacy. “I guess that’s why I’m actually sensitive about videos,” Chan admits. “I’m having trouble trying not to remember all these images… before I go to sleep, I try not to remember what I saw because I really couldn’t go to sleep every time I imagine, I’m thinking, &lt;em&gt;My God, how could our seniors be attacked?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75YoXC"&gt;For Chan, the desire for more patrols and cameras in Oakland Chinatown stems from a sense of desperate urgency — a desire to keep his community safe from what feels like endless injury with little relief in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g30E2g"&gt;Even those who disagree with Chan carry with them the history of unacknowledged pain. Earlier that day, I’d spoken with Gordon Chang, a professor of Asian American history at Stanford. We’d spoken about the violence, and though he disagreed with increased policing, he was sympathetic to Chan’s despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZnWj7"&gt;“Asians are seen as inoffensive, weak, vulnerable, and therefore, can be picked on. We all know that the Asians get picked on,” he’d put it bluntly. “This is our lot in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LPRPiF"&gt;I’ll admit, something rings true about this sentiment — many anti-Asian hate crimes are also crimes of opportunism, targeting those who are socially viewed as unlikely to fight back or speak up. But it was a sunny day when I went in search of the surveillance camera that had caught Diaz’s attack. A year of the pandemic had heightened not just racial but also economic suffering. Walking around Chinatown, I observed restaurants and shops opening — some, but not all — as people shuffled on with their day, just outside the frame of that original video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This might be your last chance to get a deal on Super Mario 3D All-Stars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmLTIdhnDPrEjEUmM7gie8DMqAI=/142x0:1762x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69053760/Switch_SuperMario3DAllStars_SMS_screen_01_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DYS6wJ"&gt;As it promised, Nintendo will pull &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;, the Switch compilation featuring &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, from shelves at the end of the day — both digital and physical. This final day in March 2021 is your last chance to get the game digitally on your Nintendo Switch, and it could be the last day you’ll be able to find it in cartridge form (that is, without spending more than the retail asking price of $60).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxp5m7"&gt;If you already got the game or are fine without it, scroll on. But if you’ve even considered picking it up to play in the future, you might as well take the plunge today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7z3RvA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xAVPfX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4QQ1FhwUQc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xXaI3s"&gt;There are other pressing deals to share with you, including Nintendo’s Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld console that features the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros&lt;/em&gt;. game built in. It, too, will no longer be produced after March 31st, 2021, so you should head over to Best Buy, Target, or Amazon to snag one if you’re interested. It’s a modern take on a classic console, with a color screen and USB-C charge port — both of which were certainly absent from its original release in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G3OjaG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10421719"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kPOLCV"&gt;This deal’s more niche, for people who have (or are soon planning to get) a VR headset. Valve’s &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; first-person VR shooter is 40 percent off until 1PM ET / 10AM PT on March 31st. Normally $60, you can get it for a much more reasonable $36. The game is a fantastic showcase for what’s capable in VR, so definitely check it out if you want to see what happens in the events that lead into the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX is adding a glass dome on Crew Dragon for 360 views of space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bg3iNNypkxy4FdLeaTsaoWcQ7HM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69053542/Exu93_nU8AAMAiC.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hWqJ5"&gt;The Crew Dragon capsule poised to fly four civilian astronauts to space this year is getting an upgrade: a glass dome will be added at the top to give space tourists a 360-degree view of the cosmos. Plans for the window were announced on Tuesday as SpaceX and the team managing the tourist mission, Inspiration4, revealed the full crew for the upcoming expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUb1cY"&gt;The glass dome-shaped window replaces Crew Dragon’s docking adapter at its nose since the spacecraft won’t be docking to the International Space Station. It’s similar to the famed cupola aboard the International Space Station, but Crew Dragon’s appears to be an uninterrupted sheet of glass, with no support structures dividing the window’s view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="moXud8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Probably most “in space” you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome &lt;a href="https://t.co/SOAIzxVGgX"&gt;https://t.co/SOAIzxVGgX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1376904492478791689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w85C9d"&gt;Crew Dragon’s protective aerodynamic shell that shields the hatch door area during launch will pop open to expose the glass dome once the craft is safely in orbit. Based on the rendering SpaceX tweeted, the cupola would fit at least one crew member from the chest up, revealing panoramic views of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f6riZ"&gt;SpaceX designed Crew Dragon under a $2.6 billion contract from NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, a public-private initiative to stimulate the development of privately built space capsules that’ll serve as NASA’s primary rides to space. Boeing is developing a competing capsule, Starliner, under the same program. Crew Dragon is already in its operational phase and flew its first two crews of government astronauts to space last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpONNs"&gt;NASA, which certified Crew Dragon for astronaut flights last year, said it doesn’t plan to use the cupola version of Crew Dragon for NASA astronaut missions and that the window’s installation doesn’t require NASA safety approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fV2vRK"&gt;“NASA currently does not have plans to fly a modified version of the Crew Dragon,” agency spokesman Josh Finch told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “As a fully commercial launch, NASA does not need to approve SpaceX’s design for the company’s private missions. NASA will continue to maintain insight into SpaceX’s systems through our normal work, including SpaceX sharing flight data from non-NASA missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDVdaq"&gt;The charity-focused Inspiration4 mission, led by billionaire tech entrepreneur and Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman, is slated to launch on September 15th, sending Isaacman and three other non-professional astronauts on a free-flying trip in Earth orbit for three days.  It will use the Crew Dragon Resilience&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;capsule that’s currently docked to the ISS in support of NASA’s Crew-1 mission, and the glass window will be installed during Resilience’s refurbishment in Florida after it returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbWu9o"&gt;“We’ve done all the engineering work, we continue to go through all the analysis and testing and qualification to ensure everything’s safe, and that it doesn’t preclude any use of this spacecraft for other missions,” Benji Reed, SpaceX’s director of Crew Dragon mission management, said during a press conference on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v55KV"&gt;The Inspiration4 crew includes Christopher Sembroski, a Lockheed Martin engineer from Everett, Washington; Sian Proctor, a college professor from Tempe, Arizona; and previously announced Hayley Arceneaux, a St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital employee and bone cancer survivor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdGnm4"&gt;The new window was announced on the same day that Richard Branson’s space tourism firm, Virgin Galactic, unveiled an upgraded version of its suborbital spaceplane SpaceShipTwo called SpaceShip III.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky’s latest update, Expeditions, arrives today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DvxUXsoB_eC_-fNe00CvDbishiY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69053504/NMS_Expeditions_02.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWnIMh"&gt;Hello Games is releasing a major update for &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; today. Called “Expeditions,” it adds seasonal events to the game in which players begin from the same planet and set off on a plotted journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La1u0e"&gt;The developer released a short trailer alongside the news today. Each expedition is themed and is intended to bring the game’s community together in a shared adventure. As players progress, they’ll earn exclusive rewards for their troubles, including parts and ship designs. The update will also include quality-of-life fixes to UI, combat, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PkFIr"&gt;Hello Games has continued to update the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450919/hello-games-no-mans-sky-next-game-sean-murray-interview"&gt;extensively&lt;/a&gt; since its release in 2016. This year marks &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;’s fifth anniversary; the developer has said previously it has more content in store to celebrate that milestone. In February, Hello Games announced it would add &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22285801/no-mans-sky-companions-pets-update-hello-games"&gt;animal companions&lt;/a&gt; to the game that could be tamed, trained, and traveled with through the universe. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine highly effective in adolescents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrBOQsiHfPLthufs9M00D788154=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69053384/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jCZHtP"&gt;The Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in 12- to 15-year-olds, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; in a press release. None of the children who received the vaccine in a clinical trial developed COVID-19, and they all developed strong antibody responses. There were no serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9OlBs"&gt;The study included 2,260 participants. Around half received the two-dose vaccine, and the other half received placebo injections. There were 18 cases of COVID-19 found in the placebo group and none in the vaccine group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvqqvM"&gt;Based on the study, the vaccine was 100 percent effective in this age group. The study was small, though, so it’s difficult to say if that number will hold up in a larger group. “But obviously, it looks good for the vaccine if there were zero Covid cases among the vaccinated people,” virologist Angela Rasmussen &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/health/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-adolescents.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcmS68"&gt;The 12- to 15-year-olds also had higher levels of antibodies one month after the second dose of the vaccine than people between 16 and 25 years old, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJEqln"&gt;Right now, the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine is authorized for people 16 years of age and older. The companies said they plan to ask the Food and Drug Administration to expand the authorization and allow the shots to be used for 12- to 15-year-olds as well. Albert Bourla, chief executive officer of Pfizer, said in a press release that the company hopes this age group can be vaccinated before the next school year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeTInC"&gt;Countries will need to vaccinate children and adolescents in order &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-shots-for-children-hold-key-to-herd-immunity-11616923801"&gt;to reach herd immunity&lt;/a&gt; to protect communities against COVID-19. Although children rarely get seriously ill from the disease, they can still get sick and sometimes develop long-lasting symptoms. They can also contract and spread the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJCwT7"&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech are also running a clinical trial testing the vaccine in children between six months and 11 years old. Moderna &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial"&gt;is testing&lt;/a&gt; its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 17 years old and also in children between six months and 11 years old. That vaccine is currently authorized for people 18 and older. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, which also has a vaccine authorized for people 18 and older, has plans to test its one-shot immunization in younger people, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/world/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-testing-children.html"&gt;from infants to 18-year-olds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aONfVy"&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;96 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s game over for Arizona’s controversial App Store bill</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The legislation disappeared before a scheduled vote last week, and now it’s likely done for the year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bkMQgy"&gt;Arizona House Bill 2005, a hotly contested piece of legislation that would have imposed developer-friendly changes to Apple and Google’s mobile app stores, is now on death’s door. The &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;, which would have allowed alternative payment systems on Android and iOS that bypass the stores’ 30 percent cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349302/arizona-hb2005-bill-vote-skipped-senate-apple-google-ios-android-app-store"&gt;mysteriously disappeared last week&lt;/a&gt; prior to a scheduled vote that could have sent it straight to the governor’s desk to be signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBIRDW"&gt;The bill had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;just won a landmark victory in the Arizona House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, and the state Senate was officially set to begin its vote at 3PM local time. HB2005 was the first bill on the agenda, yet it never came up. Now, it turns out that the Senate decided to pull the bill at the last minute, and its sponsor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its fate is effectively sealed for the rest of the year. Arizona will wrap up its congressional session next month with no plans to hear HB2005 again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73lQ9d"&gt;That’s bad news for the bill’s proponents, which include a coalition of app makers and prominent Apple critics that have been outspoken in recent months on the need for regulations on mobile app distribution. The fight is being led by the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), an industry group consisting of Apple critics and competitors like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games and Spotify, that has taken the fight against alleged app store monopolies to the local stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOVBtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These bills are part of a far-reaching push to enact state-level app store regulations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCBpiZ"&gt;The CAF has begun lobbying state legislatures to introduce bills in more than a half-dozen states at this point, to varying degrees of success. HB2005 was its most promising campaign yet, after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failure in North Dakota last month&lt;/a&gt; sank one of the first legitimate app store bills to go to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHBsWI"&gt;The primary goal of these bills is to allow developers to bypass Apple and Google’s 30 percent app store commission, while much loftier aims include forcing Apple to allow entire alternative app marketplaces on iOS and making it illegal for tech companies to retaliate against developers for trying to bypass the app store policies. Apple has decried such bills by saying they threaten to “destroy the iPhone as you know it” by opening it up to security risks and undermining the revenue stream it says helps enforce App Store reviews and other benefits, though the company has only ever spoken publicly about such legislation through submitted testimony. Without Arizona, the movement is that much weaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3I4ZjZ"&gt;So who killed HB2005? We don’t really know, but a clearer picture is beginning to emerge. At the very least, congressional members have now been willing to say publicly that Big Tech lobbying had a noticeable effect on the bill just before it went up for a vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9CrNP"&gt;State Rep. Regina Cobb, the bill’s sponsor and a Republican representing the state’s fifth district, claims Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town” and named six specific lobbyists who, she says, caused Senate members who’d previously agreed to vote to waver. “We thought we had the votes before we went to the committee yesterday, and then we heard that the votes weren’t there and they weren’t going to take the time to put it up,” Cobb said of the Senate Commerce Committee’s decision to pull the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5nTLK"&gt;That lines up with what Commerce Committee Chair J.D. Mesnard, a Republican who represents Arizona’s District 17, &lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/big-tech-lobbyists-take-down-arizonas-app-store-bill/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect &lt;/em&gt;on Friday of last week&lt;/a&gt;: he pulled the bill because he felt it would fail. “I polled the committee members and there just wasn’t enough support for it,” Mesnard said in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt;. “A number of members were conflicted on it, others were just opposed. There was some support for it, but it definitely was coming up short.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14vlSr"&gt;Cobb says she doesn’t think anything illegal or nefarious occurred, just lobbying as usual — unlike outspoken Apple critic and Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who publicly accused powerful corporations of making illicit deals, colluding with the chamber’s Democrats (some of whom opposed the bill) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFavHv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1GDH0"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show,” Hansson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;wrote on Twitter on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; of last week. “The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard.” Although &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has heard a similar allegation from multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, no one, save Hansson, felt comfortable offering an explanation on the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57ujSy"&gt;The seeming death of HB2005 and the confusion and mystery surrounding it underscore both the immense power of tech titans like Apple and Google and also the rough legislative road ahead for similar bills in Illinois, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other states around the country. The clear takeaway is that although these bills are the result of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;successful lobbying efforts&lt;/a&gt; from the CAF and its partners, the Silicon Valley lobbying that has arisen to counter these bills has proven just as savvy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5swZGE"&gt;“There’s a legitimate issue here. It’s undeniable [Apple and Google] have gatekeeper power and hold sway over the app stores, and there’s just nowhere else to go. You have to go through one of these companies to get your app before consumers,” says Pat Garofalo, the director of state and local policy at the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project, which has voiced support for the bills. “It makes perfect sense there are lots of forces — whether they be small, medium, or large — arrayed on both sides of this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrxQZJ"&gt;Cobb admits she took up the cause after being approached by the CAF and that having other big tech companies as the opposition didn’t help because it added extreme pressure to the impending vote and caused a number of congressional members on both sides to express doubt and confusion about the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5fdApK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YbD0G"&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard,” Cobb said. She said she had multiple meetings with Apple, including with longtime Apple veteran Tim Powderly, the director of federal government affairs at the company. She says the conversations were cordial, but that Apple was very intent on finding a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZWKnn"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. Google did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PrEzO1"&gt;Regardless of why the bill was pulled, the outcome is the same: Arizona HB2005 won’t be changing how Apple and Google operate their mobile app stores because its chances of ever becoming law are slim to none. “Unless it is brought as a striker, it will need to be re introduced next year,” Cobb told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a follow-up email on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MaB8H"&gt;A striker, formally known as a “strike everything amendment,” is a controversial legislative maneuver that aims to replace the entire text of a bill in an attempt to reopen debate on it and push it forward without having to abide by standard deadlines. Cobb said such a move is unlikely at this point because strikers “often get negative publicity and they’re not always successful,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaT9br"&gt;While Cobb says she isn’t intimidated by Apple or Google, she also tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; she’s not likely to keep pushing unless she thinks she’ll succeed. “I’m trying to decide how much political capital I want to put into this.” Failing that, Arizona’s Congress will meet again the following January — but the state’s attempt at regulating Apple and Google’s app stores is effectively over for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HtKclx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yggVg0"&gt;The CAF says it will continue the fight, even though it’s now seen two legislative defeats in its app store lobbying efforts, the first a more aggressive bill that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to garner enough votes in the North Dakota House last month&lt;/a&gt;. “The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBxbTg"&gt;Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project thinks it’s likely one of these state bills will succeed at one point, especially in the absence of meaningful federal regulation or antitrust enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VLYVc3"&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist,” he said. “I do think a state will do this, and there are really good reasons for a state to do it.” All it will take, he adds, is a group of lawmakers that “hears the right arguments, gets the upside, and decides to do it.” At that point, the primary thing standing in the way will be the lobbying efforts of tech companies that stand to benefit when these bills fail. &lt;/p&gt;
