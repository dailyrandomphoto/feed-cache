    <title>Google launches new search tool to help combat food insecurity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IT0jDtw1xUnFRIThnoa634eQ0vM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517398/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bUA5vq"&gt;Google announced a new website designed to be a “one-stop shop” for people with food insecurity. The &lt;a href="http://g.co/findfoodsupport"&gt;“Find Food Support” site&lt;/a&gt; includes a food locator tool powered by Google Maps which people can use to search for their nearest food bank, food pantry, or school lunch program pickup site in their community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rGbnt"&gt;Google is working with non-profit groups like No Kid Hungry and FoodFinder, as well as the US Department of Agriculture, to aggregate 90,000 locations with free food support across all 50 states — with more locations to come. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCLMyV41Dh9-ItVHK31NVqJTyu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687633/oNi6GDgn4Vdz5B4W3X383J0AxEvKEnQuLEzgqP1rAR5j7qs818cPe916aCTj7vR_ID_kEXl_x1aZtTyqRB6qi8HHdfncLu07S6BjHTm3637efWRTnpf2Cc_YATCr9JTumsuh3EYiKlFqaqGm5UrcsmvxQQOD_mmo2IZaSCD9KPEUwuc5.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CIJGK1"&gt;The new site is a product of Google’s newly formed &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/a-new-home-for-project-delta-a39f8286b6d7"&gt;Food for Good team&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as Project Delta when it was headquartered at Alphabet’s X moonshot division. Project Delta’s mission is to “create a smarter food system,” which includes standardizing data to improve communication between food distributors to curb food waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fz5nLx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;90,000 locations with free food support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfeKgx"&gt;Food insecurity is defined by the US Department of Agriculture as &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/definitions-of-food-security.aspx"&gt;a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life&lt;/a&gt;. The number of people experiencing food insecurity spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting an estimated 45 million people or &lt;a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/National%20Projections%20Brief_3.9.2021_0.pdf"&gt;1 in 7 Americans&lt;/a&gt;, including 15 million children. Google says that searches for &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=food%20bank%20near%20me"&gt;”food bank near me”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=%2Fm%2F030gj7"&gt;”Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=food%20stamps%20application"&gt;”food stamps application,”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=school%20lunch%20pickup"&gt;”school lunch pick up”&lt;/a&gt; reached record highs during 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gIwZQ"&gt;In addition to the new food location site, Google is publishing five new videos on YouTube aimed at de-stigmatizing food insecurity. The site will also include links to food support hotlines, state-by-state benefit guides, and information for specific communities, such as seniors, families and children, and military families. Visitors can also find information about how you can donate food, time and money to support those in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBp5IG"&gt;“We want people to know they’re not alone,” Emily Ma, head of Food for Good, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/connecting-people-to-food-support/"&gt;says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwDTqr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 includes new Dynamic Refresh Rate feature to save laptop battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xHlDGHI5iDWeXov8lB6NJgCM9g=/116x0:1370x836/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517393/Windows_11_Generic_Laptop_Device_Render.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9wRVy"&gt;Microsoft is introducing a new Dynamic Refresh Rate (DRR) feature in Windows 11 that’s designed to save laptop battery life and boost refresh rates when they’re really needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3j9An"&gt;A number of laptops now ship with 120Hz and beyond displays, which make Windows feel a lot smoother across scrolling, animations, and inking. While the added smoothness feels great, running at higher refresh rates takes its toll on battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XSRSk"&gt;In Windows 10 you have to decide between 60Hz and 120Hz on a laptop, and it’s a static choice. Microsoft is now building DRR into Windows 11, which will allow a laptop to dynamically adjust its refresh rate. “This means that Windows 11 will seamlessly switch between a lower refresh rate and a higher refresh rate based on what you’re doing on your PC,” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/"&gt;explains Ana Marta&lt;/a&gt;, a program manager on the graphics team at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXDHX6"&gt;You’ll need a laptop that supports DRR and 120Hz or above refresh rates, and the feature will mean that regular tasks like writing emails or documents will run at 60Hz, and then DRR will kick in and boost the screen to 120Hz for inking and scrolling. Apps will need to support DRR, and during the Windows 11 preview DRR is limited to just Office for the scrolling boost. Office, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Whiteboard, Microsoft Photos, Snip &amp;amp; Sketch, Drawboard PDF, Microsoft Sticky Notes, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft To Do, and Inkodo will all support DRR for inking, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puq8WTCCBXnv0WuhVADuGXL_vfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688228/DRR_UI_6.22.2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new DRR option in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8tEULH"&gt;DRR shouldn’t be confused with VRR (variable refresh rate), particularly because DRR doesn’t apply to games and is focused purely on Windows apps. Windows 11 will be a requirement for DRR, alongside a laptop that supports a variable refresh rate of at least 120Hz. You’ll also need a new graphics driver (WDDM 3.0), and Microsoft says it’s working with its graphics display partners to enable DRR on a variety of devices running the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;Windows 11 preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IuvYr"&gt;Where DRR looks like a natural fit is with Microsoft’s Surface line of hardware, particularly thanks to Microsoft’s focus on enabling DRR in inking scenarios. No Surface devices currently ship with a 120Hz display, but this could be an early sign that Microsoft may finally deliver a Surface tablet display that can compete with Apple’s ProMotion displays on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google beefs up Play Store developer verification in response to scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMy11f4h-yYq1mFelvh0OfUcesA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517335/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5MaO2a"&gt;Google is working to enhance the integrity of the Play Store by adding new restrictions and safeguards to developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLVzyr"&gt;Google Play Store developers will soon have to verify their email address and phone number and provide extra details like a physical address in an attempt to increase security and ensure that accounts are being created by ‘real people,’ &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/play-dev-id-requirements-2-step.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Developers will also be required to use two-step verification. The search giant says it’s making the changes “to keep Google Play safe and secure and to better serve our developer community,” and to “make sure that every account is created by a real person with real contact details.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrGIDd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/google-to-require-2fa-and-a-physical-address-from-android-app-devs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the announcement coincides with the emergence of a cottage industry of sellers who’ll create large amounts of developer accounts for others to use to upload malware and other scammy apps to the Play Store. A screenshot of a cybercrime forum post published by &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; shows these accounts being sold for $89 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fR6qGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To keep Google Play safe and secure and to better serve our developer community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dxGH8M"&gt;Meanwhile, the two-step verification requirement should make it harder for scammers to break into and steal legitimate developers accounts. It mirrors a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422778/google-accounts-enabling-two-step-verification-default"&gt;similar change the search giant announced&lt;/a&gt; for regular Google accounts earlier this year, where it will now enable two-factor authentication by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyhMSH"&gt;The changes are significant compared to Google’s current developer account policies that only require new signups to provide an email address and phone number. Details like a physical address “will not be public-facing,” the company says, and are solely to “to help us confirm your identity and communicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFKlqY"&gt;Google is introducing the new requirements in stages. It says that, from today, account owners will have the option of setting their account type as personal or business and verifying their contact details. Then, in August, all new signups will be required to follow these same steps when they create their accounts, and to use two-step verification. “Later this year” the changes will be fully implemented for all existing accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8BllN"&gt;The changes come amidst a wider crackdown on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411560/google-play-store-listings-scammy-emoji-deals-misleading-assets-guidelines-policy"&gt;scammy apps on the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, which will prohibit developers from using cheap tactics in their listings to incentivize installs. App listings will no longer be able to use eye-catching features like all-caps or emoji in their titles, or include phrases like “download now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrdxmN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYuFJF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon’s Z FC is a film camera revival in mirrorless form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gUF5w0d2VNqtK1-vbm6_hfPqyU=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69517035/Zfc_USDD_TO_6573.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRJpV4"&gt;Nikon is going all-in on the retro aesthetic with its latest Z-series mirrorless camera. The company says the new Z FC, officially styled “Z fc,” is designed specifically to evoke its FM2 film SLR from the ‘80s, with dedicated dials for settings like shutter speed, exposure compensation, and ISO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PNUbN"&gt;The approach is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5066118/nikon-df-full-frame-modern-camera-in-a-stunning-old-school-body"&gt;the Nikon DF&lt;/a&gt;, a retro-style full-frame DSLR that Nikon released in 2013. But the DF was much larger than the film cameras it was inspired by. The Z FC has a 20.9-megapixel APS-C sensor (and of course no SLR mirror and prism), which means the resulting camera is far more compact and looks a lot closer to something like an FM2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lO7JdRdm2y6a5c7WyqTK4KS-to=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688024/Zfc_16_50DX_3.5_6.3_top.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6e6zGf"&gt;Beyond the exterior, the Z FC is a modern camera with broadly similar specs to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20906990/nikon-z50-camera-announced-mirrorless-z-mount-instagram"&gt;the Z50&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a vari-angle touchscreen, an OLED electronic viewfinder, USB-C charging, SnapBridge wireless connectivity, and of course the now-requisite ability to use it as a webcam. While the camera can be shot in fully manual mode with the dials, there’s also a switch for PASM operation, and you can check aperture settings with a tiny LCD on the top plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KtyhE"&gt;The native ISO range is 100-51,200 and there’s a hybrid AF system with 209 points across 87 percent of the frame. Video isn’t really a focus with the Z FC, unsurprisingly, but it can shoot at up to 4K/30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUUb9N4Yh5WSWl8wWq4rSxFOKSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688022/Cool_PBS_C.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThVUsw"&gt;As a Z-mount camera, the Z FC will be able to use any of the full-frame lenses that are native to cameras like the Z6 and Z7, but Nikon’s lineup of DX/APS-C lenses that can make the most of the Z FC’s small size is still lacking. Nikon is announcing one new prime lens today, however — a 28mm (42mm equivalent) f/2.8 that’ll be available in a special edition with styling that makes it look like an older Nikkor D lens. Nikon will also release a silver version of its 16-50mm pancake zoom alongside the Z FC, and says a DX 18-140mm travel zoom will be available at some point this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKpgWB"&gt;The ZFC will cost $959.95 body-only, $1,099.95 with the silver 16-50mm lens, and $1,199.95 with the 28mm lens. All three options will be released in black and silver late July. Nikon is also releasing six extra color options that’ll be sold solely through its own site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ykPx3ueDbkJ8yoPl_dRPYl-kgYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688021/Q1985_Color_Cams.jpg"&gt;

    <title>LG’s C1 and G1 OLEDs get even better at gaming with 120Hz Dolby Vision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLK4LBuGcWwQxp8qwUre5aomD9Y=/22x0:1030x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516674/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_02a.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Drqel1"&gt;With Dolby Vision gaming HDR technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435864/microsoft-dolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-test"&gt;available on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles&lt;/a&gt;, some TV owners have noticed that suddenly there’s a new setting to worry over. While some HDMI 2.1-equipped 4K displays could handle 120Hz, and some can support Dolby Vision for gaming, at first there weren’t any that could do both things at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HalHt3"&gt;Now LG has &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/gaming-on-lg-premium-tvs-reach-new-heights-with-latest-dolby-vision-update/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it’s the first manufacturer with Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz support on some of its TVs, just a couple of weeks after owners noticed it arriving in updates. The 03.15.27 firmware enables the feature on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;C1 and G1 2021 OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;, and today LG says support is on the way for other premium TVs in its 2021 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ElcdBW"&gt;Additional premium models in LG’s 2021 TV lineup such as OLED Z1 series, QNED Mini LED QNED99 series and NanoCell NANO99 series TVs will also receive the update in July. Additional 2021 and 2020 TV models are also being tested for Dolby Vision gaming in either 60Hz or 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cm7Kv"&gt;The press release wasn’t specific about support for previous years, but the company has said to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2021/06/21/lg-reveals-more-on-its-new-dolby-vision-gaming-oled-tv-updateincluding-wider-model-support/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that beta software with 4K/120Hz support is coming to other 4K TVs including last year’s CX and BX models. There’s no word yet on any update for 2019 OLED TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgRBsd"&gt;All of this is happening before the first Dolby Vision HDR-enabled games are available, which we believe should help gamers automatically configure their brightness and image settings to match the TV’s capabilities. As the company behind the technology &lt;a href="https://www.dolby.com/gaming/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, “Dolby Vision games automatically map to your Dolby Vision display as you play, so you’re always seeing the full picture.” Microsoft has said it means you’ll see “brighter highlights, sharper contrast, and more vibrant colors,” although how that applies to other HDR games is harder to tell. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaewRAS4wI5X2uxclq86vwjQeHk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687780/LG_Dolby_Vision_Gaming_03a.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TP8C2y"&gt;The new firmware also adds Game Dashboard, a floating menu that should help LG owners configure their TVs and see which settings are enabled. It works on any 2021 LG TV with Game Optimizer, and can show the status of the TV’s black stabilizer, low latency and variable refresh rate (VRR), or flip between settings tuned for specific genres. Samsung was first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;with a game bar feature on its 2021 TVs&lt;/a&gt;, but with something this useful we hope more manufacturers pick up the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler reportedly refused to ban Trump’s critics as part of discussions to bring him onboard</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yRJCDl"&gt;The alternative social network Parler and representatives of former president Donald Trump were reportedly considering an idea to make Trump an active member of the platform after he left office, but Parler apparently pushed back on one key part of the proposed arrangement: the platform did not want to ban Trump’s detractors, according to an excerpt of Michael Wolff’s upcoming book about the last days of Trump’s presidency &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-wolff-landslide-final-days-trump-presidency-excerpt.html"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YuR1w"&gt;Here’s what was going on, according to Wolff: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JZio80"&gt;One curious point of consideration for the [Trump] family [the morning of January 6th] — prescient of the events that would shortly unfold — was a follow-up to a discussion initiated some months before by aides and family. Trump representatives, working with Trump-family members, had approached Parler, the social network backed by Bob Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, far-right exponents and large Trump contributors. They had floated a proposition that Trump, after he left office, become an active member of Parler, moving much of his social-media activity there from Twitter. In return, Trump would receive 40 percent of Parler’s gross revenues and the service would ban anyone who spoke negatively about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLj9SB"&gt;Parler was balking only at this last condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4eqrLO"&gt;Parler, which has been popular with conservative users, has long promoted itself as a social network that isn’t moderated as tightly as other platforms, so it’s not entirely surprising that it didn’t want to lay down a red line on content, even at the request of its most famous potential user. The company has not replied to a request for comment about the reported discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gINUrP"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/trump-parler-ownership"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; also reported on the conversations&lt;/a&gt; about Trump’s potential increased involvement with Parler, but shared different proposed terms — “Parler offered the Trump Organization a 40% stake in the company,” according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; — and did not report on Parler’s apparent refusal to ban Trump critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiG8on"&gt;Shortly after the January 6th attack on the US Capitol, Parler was banned by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; from their respective app stores and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon terminated Parler’s hosting&lt;/a&gt;. The app returned to Apple’s App Store in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440005/parler-apple-app-store-return-amazon-google-capitol"&gt;though it had some content excluded&lt;/a&gt;. It still isn’t available on Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Juul settles with North Carolina in first teen vaping lawsuit </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHNsjcRoLv10d7ALmZnwNl7GNBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516503/acastro_180702_2708_juul_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rSe6j"&gt;Juul has agreed to settle its first state lawsuit over deceptive business practices with North Carolina, a move that will limit the vaping company’s marketing claims and placement of products in stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgGlXC"&gt;Under the &lt;a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Juul will no longer use marketing strategies geared toward young people, including most social media marketing campaigns, advertising near schools, and sponsoring sporting events or concerts. The company also cannot use models under 35 years old for advertisements in the state, and it’s required that Juul products are sold behind the counters of stores, according to &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article252318958.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Juul will also pay a $40 million fine to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr6eM2"&gt;“North Carolina is now the first state in the nation to hold Juul accountable for its instrumental role in sparking the epidemic of youth vaping and its resulting nicotine addiction,” North Carolina attorney general Josh Stein &lt;a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a press statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SstqtQ"&gt;Juul will also send undercover teen agents to 1,000 stores each year to make sure Juul products aren’t being sold to those &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/us-e-cigarette-regulations-50-state-review/nc"&gt;under age 18&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nb7uxG"&gt;“This settlement is consistent with our ongoing effort to reset our company and its relationship with our stakeholders, as we continue to combat underage usage and advance the opportunity for harm reduction for adult smokers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1XOIs"&gt;This is the first known lawsuit Juul has settled for its deceptive marketing practices, but it’s far from the last on the docket. The company faces similar lawsuits in at least nine other states, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/north-carolina-wins-40-million-settlement-in-juul-lawsuit.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and at least 100 schools have joined a &lt;a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/school-districts-are-suing-juul-over-youth-vaping-do-they-stand-a-chance/2020/02"&gt;national lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; to recoup costs associated with anti-vaping campaigns. Thirty-nine other states are also considering similar lawsuits to North Carolina’s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article252420018.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG6Qb8"&gt;Juul stopped selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919415/juul-suspends-sale-fruity-flavor-pods-ecigarette"&gt;fruity flavored pods&lt;/a&gt; like mango in 2019 as part of an effort to head off these mounting lawsuits. The company ceased selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953865/juul-mint-flavor-discontinue-ban-fda-vaping-illness"&gt;mint-flavored pods&lt;/a&gt; shortly after. Under the North Carolina settlement, Juul cannot introduce new flavors or new levels of nicotine in the state without prior approval from the FDA. The FDA is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/23/democrats-slam-fda-crack-down-juul/"&gt;already reviewing&lt;/a&gt; whether Juul and other e-cigarette products can stay on the market beyond September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s new update fixes its crashing problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wu7ItIATayqYYKLGHTtE5ta4qUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514767/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yBtjoK"&gt;If you’ve been experiencing the bug where the iOS version of Snapchat crashes at launch, it seems that there’s now an update to fix it available in the App Store. The bug that’s been fixed by the update didn’t appear to have affected the Android version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2Z7F"&gt;Before updating to the latest version, 11.34.1.35, the app would give me a message that something went wrong, before crashing to Springboard on my iPhone 12 Mini. Now, I’m no longer getting the error, and have successfully been able to send a Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kodK5Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976"&gt;This is what the bug looked like&lt;/a&gt; when it was present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1we3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh snap &lt;a href="https://t.co/yC2BKjhzmw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yC2BKjhzmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80qzZk"&gt;The Snapchat Support Twitter account hasn’t yet tweeted about the fix (despite &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1409501297737359366?s=20"&gt;having a pinned tweet&lt;/a&gt; talking about the bug), but Snap’s SVP of Product &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacobandreou/status/1409640178352680960"&gt;has tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the issue being fixed. Both myself and one of my co-workers tested the update, and it fixed the crashing issue for both of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkbbKz"&gt;If your phone isn’t automatically downloading the update, you can grab it yourself by going to the App Store, tapping on your profile picture in the top right corner, and pulling down to refresh. Any available updates should appear, and you can download them. If you turned off Auto-update to avoid the bugged version, you can turn it back on by going to Settings &amp;gt; App Store, and then toggling App Updates on under Automatic Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj8B3m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 7:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the issue appears to have been fixed by an update from Snapchat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office is getting a new design and a native 64-bit Arm version for Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEkJ-reY6LLBP4_pTD30Sv78aEk=/138x0:1623x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69516175/Zoomed_in_view_of_WXP_in_default_theme_in_SV.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Obs61"&gt;&lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/64-bit-office-for-windows-on-arm"&gt;Microsoft is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that the next version of Office for Windows 11 will have a native 64-bit Arm version, for improved performance on large or picture-filled documents, and support for 64-bit add-ins. The new version of Office is currently in beta, available to &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/"&gt;Office Insiders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwI8im"&gt;Microsoft also announced &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/visual-refresh-of-office-apps-for-windows"&gt;a redesign of Office&lt;/a&gt;, which you can see above and below. While it uses a similar design to Windows 11, it’ll be available whether you're running the Windows 11 Preview or Windows 10. In addition to the new design, Office will also adapt to your Windows light / dark mode, so you should be able to avoid the experience of opening a document and having it blast light into your eyes at night. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4kSqt3QNq0Dq8uweVBByzgwADc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687533/Excel_and_PPT_in_SV_NEW_1536x864.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newly-designed Excel and PowerPoint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y47sBe"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t shied away from talking about Arm with Windows 11. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554245/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-intel-7th-gen-amd-zen-1-pc"&gt;contentious list&lt;/a&gt; of supported CPUs &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-qualcomm-processors"&gt;includes a handful of Qualcomm chips&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8vO1inHBb8"&gt;used the Arm-powered Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; to show off the tablet capabilities of its new OS. For those with Arm machines, it’s probably a good sign — having native apps is likely going to be more efficient than emulation, and provide better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnR4gy"&gt;It is, however, perhaps a little awkward that it took so long for a 64-bit Arm version of Office to come to Windows — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176548/microsoft-office-native-m1-apps-apple-silicon-support"&gt;M1 Macs got a native version&lt;/a&gt; late last year. There are also a few features that Microsoft mentions haven't come to the Arm version of Office yet, though that’s to be expected given that it’s currently in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHPshL"&gt;In addition to being in the Office Insider program, those who want to test out 64-bit Office on their Arm Windows machine will also have to be running &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;the Windows 11 Insider Preview&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll also have to uninstall any 32-bit versions of Office they may have installed before reinstalling Office and updating to the beta version. If you’re running the Office beta on either Windows 10 or 11, you should be able to turn the redesign on from the Coming Soon pane in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoftBank has reportedly halted production of its Pepper robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pepper-softbank-robot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aa6HeT0Ma1wIiEoyx7r7HJet_JQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515973/DSC01589__1_.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hv8v9k"&gt;SoftBank is reportedly restructuring its robotics business and has already halted production of its Pepper robot, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Robotics is just one of many businesses the large Japanese firm has invested in, but potentially permanently ending production of Pepper is notable because of the robot’s role as a sort of unofficial mascot for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8npFxE"&gt;SoftBank plans to lay off 330 staff members based in France, the original home of SoftBank’s robotics efforts, and apparently half of the division’s sales team in the UK and the US, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; writes. Production of Pepper robots was reportedly halted last year and would be costly to restart, &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; sources claim. We’ve reached out to SoftBank to confirm the details of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOJY3h"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;report follows closely after SoftBank’s sale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics to Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly seems like the company is reconsidering what exactly it wants to do in the robot business. For now, that means less futuristic moonshot promises and more practical business-type offerings, like &lt;a href="https://us.softbankrobotics.com/whiz"&gt;a carpet-cleaning robot called Whiz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRz8d4"&gt;Pepper was initially pitched as a robot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781628/softbank-announces-pepper-robot"&gt;that could understand human emotion&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5820080/meeting-softbank-pepper-robot"&gt;possible&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced and hasn’t become any more true, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10726082/softbank-pepper-ibm-watson-collaboration"&gt;an assist from IBM’s Watson&lt;/a&gt;. SoftBank then pushed its friendly bot into all sorts of odd, if charming scenarios, like working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/24/16196752/robot-buddhist-priest-funeral-softbank"&gt;as a Buddhist priest&lt;/a&gt;, playing docent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/24/17277350/softbank-pepper-the-robot-smithsonian-museum"&gt;at the Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;, and staffing the company’s stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hJBwGf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-A3ZLLGuvQY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=82&amp;amp;start=82" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vxYQXo"&gt;Pepper might not have ever lived up to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A3ZLLGuvQY&amp;amp;t=82s"&gt;the ads used to sell it&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, but it could be charming. My interactions with the waist-high android are limited, but after hearing about Pepper a lot online, seeing the real deal was kind of a capital-E experience. I had wandered into a crowded SoftBank store in Tokyo and was greeted by Pepper in Japanese with a friendly smile and a little wave. On paper, traditional robot stuff. But in the moment? I would have at least considered whatever prepaid phone plan Pepper was pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8gA7W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upqhHa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
