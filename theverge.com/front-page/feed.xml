    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ebccv0"&gt;Adorable drone footage came out last week showing two right whales touching bellies and wrapping their flippers around each other — appearing to “hug.” It was a moment rarely caught on camera. Scientists still aren’t exactly sure what that behavior really means, but the moment is a window into the dramatic world of whale sex and conservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZGeBdY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZvO4pp6Alo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OhVKPN"&gt;The video that’s been released to the public was just one snippet of a series of footage from two drones that was captured on February 28th in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts. The team documenting what happened that day included veterinarian and senior scientist Michael Moore from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), National Geographic photographer Brian Skerry, and Amy Knowlton from the New England Aquarium. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Moore about what he saw that day, and why the video they captured is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AINbNB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcL600"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were you researching when your team caught this moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGrI4H"&gt;We’ve had a longtime interest in the health of North American right whales because they need to be healthy to be able to reproduce and make babies. The focus of so much of the conservation efforts for the endangered species or declining endangered species has been on reducing mortality. Mortality is really important stuff, obviously. But if you stop the mortalities, but you don’t enable them to have a better reproductive life, then the trend isn’t going to reverse. So you need babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rZqmgf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You need babies.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KMoqLy"&gt;As a veterinarian, I’m always interested in the condition of an animal. How does it look? For a wild animal, that means getting informative photographs because you can’t get hands on them. You can’t listen to them with a stethoscope. And so we’ve been working with colleagues since the late ‘90s to look at the body condition and the growth rate of North Atlantic right whales using aerial photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdulUb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you walk me through the moments leading up to the event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1rdki"&gt;Essentially, our routine is to line up the stars in terms of weather, people, and whales. It was early in the season, so the information wasn’t that solid and the weather wasn’t that good, but we did have a good day. We hopped on the boat and out we went. We work with folks with the aquarium who are really good whale observers to help us find the whales, and Brian Skerry was also with us getting footage, stills, for his work in the magazine business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuPzCH"&gt;We’d scoot around the bay looking for groups of whales, and we found some. Once we felt that we knew what was going on and settled down, we launched the drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyygYw"&gt;The behavioral event that we documented there is called a surface active group; that’s where right whales come together and they spend time at and near the surface together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dccHx6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you see the whales doing? Is what you captured considered a hug? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1CPlQ"&gt;The word “belly-to-belly” is the word that has been used in the database of behaviors by the New England aquarium to standardize, “Okay, at this point in time, these animals are lying side by side and their bellies were touching each other.” So belly-to-belly is a neutral term that adequately describes what that video shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nLydnX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“belly-to-belly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dSmxTs"&gt;Were they hugging? I mean, we didn’t ever say they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; hugging. But we asked the question because I think it’s a reasonable question. I guess hugging has an operational definition and an implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnFsCb"&gt;So, operationally, a hug is where two mammals — I don’t know, maybe only humans can hug, it all depends on how you define things — wrap their arms around each other. You know, the flippers of a right whale are homologous to the arms of a human. So physically, yeah, they were hugging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzmX3Z"&gt;If you include the concept of affection in the definition of a hug, then we don’t know whether they were hugging or not. We don’t know if they were showing affection or not. We can hypothesize that they were; it would be hard to test that hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrQ3CR"&gt;The hardcore scientists do believe that behaviors that humans demonstrate are unique to humans. Certainly it’s easier to interrogate two humans who have been hugging and ask them whether they were showing affection. You can’t do that for whales, so we really don’t know what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZPVZbj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They need a whole lot more love”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nI2ppY"&gt;One of the reasons why I wanted that video to be widely seen was there was an aesthetic in that video that certainly had some emotional qualities. And given the extent to which the right whale species has been devastated by anthropogenic trauma, a little bit of anthropomorphism, if that were to build some sympathy and empathy for these animals, is something that I’m totally prepared to indulge in. These animals need every piece of help they can get from the human race. They need a whole lot more love from many humans than they’re currently getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iB52g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Atlantic right whales are considered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iucn.org/news/species/202007/almost-a-third-lemurs-and-north-atlantic-right-whale-now-critically-endangered-iucn-red-list"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;critically endangered, and “one step from extinction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.” What threats are the whales facing from humans? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: the rest of the interview contains some graphic descriptions of both whale injuries and whale sex. Also, “sea serpents.”]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gunvcm"&gt;I’ve spent a fair amount of time looking at dead right whales on beaches to diagnose why they died, and the two primary causes of death we document are entanglements with fishing gear and collisions with ships. Collisions with ships generally break down into either being cut up like a loaf of bread with a spinning propeller, or they get hit by a blunt part of the ship, and then they get bruised and broken bones. That’s unfortunate and totally inappropriate, and needs to stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAWrJn"&gt;The entanglement process varies in terms of the size of the animal. The bigger and stronger they are, the more likely they are to successfully avoid drowning because they have enough power to swim up to the surface and break the gear away so they can breathe. If you’re entangled fatally, you’re probably going to take six months to die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY02VV"&gt;I don’t care if it’s a wild animal or if it’s a human, it shouldn’t happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pvfdn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It must have been a welcome break for you to see healthy whales.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZqUtt"&gt;One of the motivations for us to share that video was that there’s been so much bad news about right whales. It was time to have something that was beautiful — and intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRPPcc"&gt;These surface active groups can involve copulation. We don’t know if any baby right whales were conceived that day. The two in that video were male so obviously not in that instance. But there were females around and there were active penises in the video and so on so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EIWX8"&gt;So it’s as close as one comes to seeing some hope that these animals have a chance of recovering through sexual activity, which is good. Right whale reproduction is actually pretty extraordinary. I don’t know if you want to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGNhFL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do now. Were you able to actually capture reproduction from that group of whales that day? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIPZIh"&gt;I don’t know, to answer your question briefly. In the surface active groups, there are quite often observations of what we call “sea serpents.” And you can imagine what they really are: these long, flexible, snaky things. A right whale penis is about 12 feet long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ms2bIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We did see penises waving around in the water”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YUjP6H"&gt;We did see penises waving around in the water. But we didn’t actually record any finishes in the right place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruMF3U"&gt;Male right whales have the largest testicles of any living mammal. And that is because males have evolved to compete with each other, not physically or violently in any way, for access to the female, but purely by sheer volume. At times, we have had photographs in the past where not one but two finished in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Simultaneous-copulation-of-two-male-right-whales-with-a-female-in-the-Bay-of-Fundy-11_fig1_236892818"&gt;right place at the same time&lt;/a&gt;. Because essentially, they try to flush each other out by having more volume than anybody else. I’m trying to be sensitive to this because it’s just a complicated topic. &lt;em&gt;Chuckles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xao9h1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the two whales that were captured in that belly-to-belly moment have “active sea serpents”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNN3t2"&gt;Actually what I recall was the active sea serpents were coming up from further down in the water column so they were from other whales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPoM2f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since your conservation research focuses on reproduction, is there anything that conservationists can do to encourage that behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6pgqR"&gt;The behavior will happen when they’re ready to get pregnant, when they’re receptive. The receptiveness of these animals, I think, depends upon their health. If they are fit and fat and ready to commit to get pregnant, they’ll do it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Right Whales Spotted Close To Shore On Cape Cod Bay" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ASuXsin5BZwmuNd8MrfefO83rjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514472/472571336.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DUXBURY, MA: An aerial view of a right whale erupting from the blowhole while feeding off the shores of Duxbury Beach. There were groups of the North Atlantic right whales swimming offshore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2uXhca"&gt;So, what we have to do as conservationists is to enhance their health, not just stop killing them. How do we do that? We reduce these stressors that are reducing their health. Vessel collision and entanglement aren’t just mortality factors. They’re are also sub-lethal stressors. The sub-lethal stressors involved with vessels are sub-lethal collisions, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22166314/covid-19-pandemic-ocean-noise-pollution"&gt;noise that they make when they go by causing a reduction in the abilities of the animals to communicate with each other&lt;/a&gt;. Every entanglement is another detriment to their health. They may just brush against [fishing gear] and get a small scar and that really wasn’t a big deal. They may be entangled for weeks or months, and then they’ll get out of it. During that time, they’ve been towing gear and traps and rope around. It’s been traumatizing to their skin, to their blubber. The drag will increase their energy output, they need to feed more. They’ll probably lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaUMmz"&gt;So, what can we do to encourage that behavior? Get them into a situation where they are healthy enough to want to indulge in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFlqve"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you want people to know about right whales? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uiLwk"&gt;Anything they need to know about right whales they can read in my book that comes out in October, &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo113867120.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are all Whalers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Famicom Detective Club brings more great crime drama to the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLMjFWCHA095inMjZheCwh3VyLc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287135/Switch_FDCgsb_SCRN_03_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p76AUx"&gt;There’s something about the Nintendo Switch that makes it a great fit for murder mystery stories. Just like a good novel, these are games best enjoyed while curled up in a comfy chair with a warm drink, ideally when it’s dark and rainy outside. That’s one of the reasons why games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306762/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-remastered-review-xbox-ps4-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21166865/murder-by-numbers-review-nitendo-switch-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder By Numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are best enjoyed on Nintendo’s tablet, which lets you play wherever you want. It’s also what makes the &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; series so interesting — a pair of long-lost titles from the ‘80s that have been given a fresh new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaP6CM"&gt;There are two titles launching today: &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt; and a prequel called &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Stands Behind&lt;/em&gt;. Though they look new, these games were first released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Each game has been given a modern makeover, with beautiful character portraits and detailed backdrops with just a hint of animation to make them feel alive. It’s a big step up from the original games, which were dominated by plain black menus and comparatively simple pixel art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VuVFNJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10500084"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nX9zZt"&gt;The Switch release also marks the English-language debut for the &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; series. So far I’ve played through the first, &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt;, and it stands up surprisingly well for a 30-year-old game. It’s a typical setup for a murder mystery. After the matriarch of a rich family in a small Japanese town dies, the family’s butler hires you to investigate. It’s a story involving feuding siblings vying for control of a company, the titular missing heir who has the rights to a big inheritance, and even some superstitious villagers who believe the family is cursed. Oh, and to make matters even more challenging, your character is also suffering from amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jymmtS"&gt;It’s not a particularly original story, but it’s full of some great twists and turns, including more than one unexpected death. It plays out sort of like a less goofy version of the &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series, albeit without the courtroom drama. &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as a visual novel, which means most of your time is spent talking to characters to gather hints. There’s also some light detective work where you can scan the environment for clues. You don’t necessarily get those big “ah ha!” moments that happen in other detective games, but &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt; makes up for this with a story that’s packed with mysteries, making it hard to put down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7nIR0Ab--_bvX-Jp9vRynww8To=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514367/Switch_FDCmh_SCRN_04_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYH14P"&gt;It’s mostly pretty straightforward: at any given moment there are only a few characters to talk to and one or two locations to explore. But this is also where the game starts to show its age. One of the more annoying aspects involves asking people the same questions multiple times in order to get new information. It gets tedious after a while, and there were a few times in the game where I found myself stuck, unable to find the trigger that pushed the story forward. There’s no hint system to help you along, either. That said, there are some nice quality-of-life features, like a robust notebook detailing all of the characters and a “previously on” story update every time you start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQWFma"&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these games is that they barely feel dated at all. If it didn’t have “Famicom” in the title, I might think they were new crime dramas from Nintendo that just so happened to be set in the 1980s. What &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; lacks in innovation it makes up for with everything else: gorgeous art, captivating writing, and more than enough mystery to keep you glued to your Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKYboU"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; The Girl Who Stands Behind&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launch today on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Graduation Gift Guide 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gift ideas for those graduating into college and adulthood&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mDXDvd"&gt;It’s been a hard year for everyone, but it’s been especially grueling for high school seniors. Having to deal with classes, exams, and college applications and choices is difficult at the best of times but having to do most — or all — of it remotely during a plague year will stress even the most laid-back of students. So it stands to reason that this year’s grads deserve some extra-special gifts to make up for it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHCSKk"&gt;This year, we’ve tried to put together a list of devices and other products that will make it easier for graduates to start on their new adventure: Macs, Chromebooks, and Windows PCs; earbuds and speakers; and stuff to help with cooking, gaming, and sleeping. Take a look and see if any of these are right for any graduates whom you may want to present with a congratulatory gift.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Google I/O 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olreDybsyCByu0E35VLRnzSiHd0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286957/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91ZKxL"&gt;Google I/O, the company’s big developer conference, is back after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188669/google-i-o-canceled-2020-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;canceled last year&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The keynote kicks off on Tuesday, May 18th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT, and it will likely be packed with news about Google products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPZcpc"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://events.google.com/io/session/88b34a4e-6170-4f18-a321-4260fb559e60?lng=en"&gt;keynote’s official description&lt;/a&gt;, Google is unsurprisingly coy about what might be announced: “Tune in to find out about how we’re furthering our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” But we can make a few educated guesses about what could be shown off at the event. Read on to find out what to expect from the big show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GSRDwk"&gt;We’ll likely learn a lot more about Android 12&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HqJANM"&gt;Google often uses its Google I/O keynotes to exhaustively detail its next major version of Android, and we expect the same for this year’s release, Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ILdPV"&gt;Google has already released a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395383/android-12-developer-preview-3-haptics-camera-sensors-beta-release-date-features"&gt;previews&lt;/a&gt; of Android 12, which have mostly brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289976/android-12-developer-preview-roundup-notifications-redesign-tweaks-emergency-sos"&gt;a lot of small tweaks&lt;/a&gt; and developer-focused features. But at I/O, Google will likely reveal some of Android 12’s biggest user-facing features — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291296/android-12-developer-preview-ui-changes-widget-stacks-lock-screen-notifications"&gt;some significant UI changes&lt;/a&gt; that are rumored to be in the works, like stacked widgets and a new lock screen with larger clock text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sS3JCO"&gt;Android 12 seems poised to be a big upgrade, and Google will likely share a whole lot about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vJJ1AR"&gt;Major Google services should get some spotlight, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7SJsRp"&gt;Google also likes to use I/O to showcase major updates to its services and software, and this year’s event will likely be no different. In previous years, we’ve seen Google use I/O to announce things like Google Maps’ incognito mode, new Assistant voices, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018"&gt;Google Duplex demo&lt;/a&gt;, where the Google Assistant called a hair salon to book an appointment. Google could plan to take the wraps off some similarly exciting new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gSDBwx"&gt;Maybe Google will announce the Pixel Buds A-Series for real this time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WMN8ff"&gt;We already know the company is working on a new model of its Pixel Buds true wireless headphones — thanks in large part to a couple of huge leaks from Google itself — and perhaps they’ll make their debut (again) at I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WytV4x"&gt;Here’s the timeline of what’s been revealed so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UQTbko"&gt;In March, two devices that seem very likely to be new Buds appeared &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/23/new-google-pixel-buds-incoming-fcc/"&gt;in Federal Communications Commission filings&lt;/a&gt; — a sign that can indicate that a product will go on sale sometime soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2nZxZ7"&gt;In April, Google included an image of an unreleased pair of olive green &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370608/google-pixel-buds-a-photo-leak"&gt;Pixel Buds in an email&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w8OFnW"&gt;Earlier this month, Google tweeted an announcement for the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/"&gt;“Pixel Buds A-Series”&lt;/a&gt; from the Android Twitter account before quickly removing the post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bp3Yxz8DpIDZyRIZFYozW7Ovnoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513228/Pixel_Buds_A_Series_tweet.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s official tweet about the “Pixel Buds A-Series,” before it was deleted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c0KAeC"&gt;These leaks don’t tell us all that much about the buds, but the “A-Series” moniker seems to indicate they’ll be a more affordable model of the company’s true wireless headphones, similar to how the lower-cost Pixel models are identified with “A” names like the Pixel 4A. And speaking of “A” phones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Oj17Ru"&gt;We likely won’t see the Pixel 5A, even though it has already been announced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khJVai"&gt;Google officially announced the Pixel 5A 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to a rumor that the phone had been canceled, but we probably won’t see more of it at Google I/O this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atufvT"&gt;When Google announced the upcoming phone, the company said “it will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.” The Pixel 4A, 4A 5G, and Pixel 5 were all announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;in early August last year&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems like we might be waiting until some time around then to see an official reveal of Google’s next midrange phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yNJ623"&gt;Google could share details about its custom processor for Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0Guv6z"&gt;Google is rumored to be developing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;custom-designed system on a chip&lt;/a&gt; (SoC) for upcoming Pixel phones, the company’s first, and perhaps Google will discuss some of what that sea change could mean for Android developers and prospective Pixel buyers at I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58VE1E"&gt;The so-called “GS101” chip may have a “3 cluster setup with a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit),” which could improve performance for machine learning applications and might also include an integrated Titan M security chip, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-custom-system-on-chip/#update1"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And we might first see the chip on board two new Pixel phones that debut this fall, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/02/pixel-6-google-gs101-whitechapel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1z5d7"&gt;A Google-designed SoC could bring some major performance benefits to the company’s Pixel lineup, like what Apple sees with its custom A-series chips in iPhones. But there’s also a good chance that Google keeps this rumored chip under wraps until it unveils devices that actually have it on board, so don’t set your expectations too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="70XLrz"&gt;And Google could always surprise us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OPQkel"&gt;Although Google has a reputation for being unable to keep its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450764/google-pixel-5-design-specs-leak-hardware-software-camera"&gt;biggest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459849/google-chromecast-new-remote-home-depot-early-sale-pre-release-leak"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/18/20868935/google-pixel-4-xl-rumors-leaks-specs-details-colors-cameras-soli"&gt;secret&lt;/a&gt;, there’s always the possibility that the company has some totally new and surprising things in store for this year’s I/O. Keep it locked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; during the event to stay up to date on the latest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Starlink review: broadband dreams fall to Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4qkijzwKoDcc2gPScwJCFISAQY=/0x45:2040x1405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286758/npatel_20210512_4552_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starlink’s Dishy McDishface satellite dish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s satellite internet service is a technological marvel — when it works&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="aFwt5S"&gt;The problem with reality is that it is very irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jcWQi"&gt;In our imaginations, we might dream of a satellite internet system that delivers lightning-fast broadband speeds from space, freeing us from the dreary earthbound experience of cable monopolies and wireless data caps. We might envision an ISP that smashes through the plodding local politics of digging fiber trenches by literally achieving escape velocity and delivering fast, reliable internet from the heavens above. A system that will work on moving trucks, RVs, and even boats. Space-based internet access that will change everything because there is nothing technology cannot achieve in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoOQZx"&gt;Starlink, a new satellite internet service from SpaceX, is a spectacular technical achievement that might one day do all of these things. But right now it is also very much a beta product that is unreliable, inconsistent, and foiled by even the merest suggestion of trees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aE0Yky"&gt;Reality, it must be emphasized, is very irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Starlink dish pointing at the sky" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOLhpZwlHAXMgiCIF0l9zFON2F0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512176/npatel_20210512_4552_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Starlink dish automatically orients itself to find satellites in orbit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4JuGj8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has not written a story about broadband access or telecom policy in recent memory without a chorus of commenters responding that Starlink would fix it in some way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;Access gap&lt;/a&gt;? Starlink. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365753/wow-wideopenwest-internet-cable-data-cap-pizza-excuse"&gt;Data caps&lt;/a&gt;? Starlink. Wackadoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336872/hbo-max-data-cap-att-net-neutrality-california-zero-rating-streaming"&gt;net neutrality bullshit&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Starlink will fix it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbkPh1"&gt;I completely understand where this is coming from: most Americans live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;under the shadow&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8321437/maps-show-why-internet-is-more-expensive-us-europe-competition"&gt;regional cable monopolies&lt;/a&gt; that dominate the broadband market with high prices, sadistic data policies, and poor customer support. If you do have the choice of a second internet provider, it is often based on older technology and offers much slower speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e3w2bU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UlpxmT"&gt;In rural America, the situation is even worse: a combination of bad policy and greed means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;there are huge swaths of the country&lt;/a&gt; where people aren’t even connecting at 25Mbps down, the pathetic standard for “broadband speed” used by the federal government. Where I live in rural New York state, the best available data suggests that only 43 percent of people connect at 25Mbps or above. That is ridiculous, especially since wireless carriers, in particular, have begged for lax regulatory oversight against the promise of delivering rural broadband over LTE and now 5G. They have mostly failed to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MRJLM"&gt;The idea of ordering a $499 dish with a $99 monthly fee that can deliver Starlink’s current goal of 100Mbps down and 20Mbps up would indeed be a dream come true — especially since Starlink has set a long-term goal of 1Gbps down. It represents &lt;em&gt;competition&lt;/em&gt;, something the American broadband market sorely lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6dzp"&gt;In that context, Starlink also represents something else: the American telecom policy establishment’s long-standing, almost religious belief that consumers are best served by something called “facility-based competition.” Starlink is a new &lt;em&gt;facility&lt;/em&gt; for accessing the internet, one that does not rely on existing infrastructure. “&lt;em&gt;Facility-based competition&lt;/em&gt;,” telecom lobbyists feverishly whisper while handing out their dirty, sweat-stained checks in Congress. “&lt;em&gt;That is the American way.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wAKWlo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;American broadband policy stinks, and we all pay too much money for slow speeds and terrible customer service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0vEPf"&gt;Of course, the only thing a decades-long commitment to “facility-based competition” has brought to most Americans is… &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;a total lack of competition&lt;/a&gt;. Reality, as I have said, is quite irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVl3Et"&gt;(By contrast, in Europe, where the prevailing philosophy is called “service-based competition,” large incumbent providers are required to lease fiber access to competitors and there is a thriving market for internet access with much lower prices for much faster speeds. If the United States were in Europe, it &lt;a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-costs-compared-worldwide"&gt;would have the most expensive broadband in the region&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkeDnQ"&gt;Anyway, American broadband policy stinks, and we all pay too much money for slow speeds and terrible customer service. It is no wonder people are delirious with excitement about Starlink, which promises to provide access from a constellation of thousands of tiny satellites blanketing the Earth, using a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmdQnIlnRo"&gt;cutting-edge phased array antenna in the dish&lt;/a&gt; to quickly track the satellites moving across the sky. When it is fully deployed, Starlink claims it will operate the world’s largest satellite constellation, managed by a new &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd3tkll/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;automated orbital guidance&lt;/a&gt; system and an automated collision avoidance system, which has already been involved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;in a controversial close call&lt;/a&gt;. (Starlink has also run into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847243/spacex-starlink-satellite-european-space-agency-aeolus-conjunction-space-debris"&gt;communications problems&lt;/a&gt; with other satellite operators.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBrNZ6"&gt;Starlink is a lot of very bold engineering advancements packaged up in a $499 consumer product; the whole thing is &lt;a href="https://advanced-television.com/2020/09/17/phased-array-antennas-are-satellites-holy-grail/"&gt;far more advanced&lt;/a&gt; than previous satellite internet systems, which are slow, heavily data-capped, and very expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="uB7eIu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starlink is a lot of very bold engineering advancements packaged up for $499&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="StuQkm"&gt;The Starlink coverage map divides the globe into a honeycomb-like hexagonal grid; the satellites launched so far mostly provide service in the northern part of North America. The whole thing is still in beta, so access is limited — even if you’re in a coverage area, there are only so many available slots in each part of the grid, so as not to stress the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKBh3n"&gt;Luckily, my area has not yet filled its allotment yet, so I was able to simply sign up on the website, and my kit arrived about a week later. &lt;em&gt;Let’s smash the system&lt;/em&gt;, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZUwfO"&gt;Then I learned about trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Starlink dish in the back of a truck" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwnxCHLPkdEBX-h3UUeUplumeXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512179/npatel_20210512_4552_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dish is small and light enough that you can easily move it to different locations, but you’re not guaranteed service anywhere but the address where you signed up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ATGj3I"&gt;Inside the large gray Starlink box, you’ll find four items: the dish itself, which is connected to a 100-foot power-over-Ethernet (PoE) cable; a short black metal tripod stand for the dish; the main black Starlink power adapter; and a small silver Wi-Fi router with its own white PoE cable. The fundamental setup is incredibly simple: you plug both Ethernet cables into the power adapter, plug that into the wall, and you’re done. The printed instructions in the box are just pictograms, like Ikea for space internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="rwGOri"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10499096"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G1hsfh"&gt;All of the hardware is nicely designed — even though it’s in beta, it feels close to a consumer product already, with a sense of style that goes well beyond the hospital equipment vibes of most satellite gear. The dish itself (officially named “Dishy McDishface”) is made of white plastic, with a matte white texture on its face. Two buttons on the mounting pole click into the included tripod mount, and that’s that. There are motors that rotate and tilt the dish to align it automatically; no fiddling required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFSe19"&gt;(One design oversight: the cable is permanently attached to the dish, so if it gets damaged — it’s outside, after all — you’re likely looking at replacing the entire dish, not just the cable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RB2suC"&gt;Although the Starlink kit ships with a short tripod and the sparse online instructions refer to it being “knee-high,” the dish really needs to be mounted as high up as you can get it. Starlink requires near-perfect line of sight to its satellites, which are often fairly low in the sky. Trees, buildings, and even poles will easily obstruct the signal, so if you’ve got tall trees blocking the horizon there’s really no choice but to get up and over them. Starlink beta testers have gone to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/mxluoi/dishy_up_16_feet_above_my_chimney_and_giving/"&gt;hilarious and wonderful DIY lengths&lt;/a&gt; to solve this problem. (If there is one unreservedly excellent thing about Starlink, it is the community of beta testers, who are all the sort of clear-eyed we’ll-figure-it-out nerds that lend early tech products an air of infectious discovery and enthusiasm. I love you, Starlink people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLPwfS"&gt;I am going to emphasize the line-of-sight requirement, since it is crucial to understanding what Starlink can and cannot do right now, and it’s an important reality check on what it might be able to do in the future. Like the similarly over-hyped mmWave 5G, Starlink is remarkably delicate. Even &lt;em&gt;a single tree&lt;/em&gt; blocking the dish’s line of sight to the horizon will degrade and interrupt your Starlink signal. Whatever satellite internet dreams you may have will run crashing into this reality until you can literally rise above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRa7Et"&gt;Starlink’s website makes all of this &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com/faq"&gt;crystal clear&lt;/a&gt;. “If any object such as a tree, chimney, pole, etc. interrupts the path of the beam, even briefly, your internet service will be interrupted,” says Starlink. “The best guidance we can give is to install your Starlink at the highest elevation possible where it is safe to do so, with a clear view of the sky. Users who live in areas with lots of tall trees, buildings, etc. may not be good candidates for early use of Starlink.” (I encourage you to square the advice to mount the dish as high as possible with the Starlink team’s further recommendation to bring ol’ Dishy &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd3y11d/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;in high wind conditions&lt;/a&gt;. Keep that ladder handy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Starlink app showing obstructions blocking the dish’s view of the satellites" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKCQAKSpbAczQj98v1fjA3kKTTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513070/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Starlink app showing obstructions blocking the dish’s view of the satellites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Starlink’s entire field of view is open sky except for the top of a house and the trees behind it, as seen from the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Db8bDwwJh9UNIuTWYZPOxl6YLU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514331/IMG_1896.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;My Starlink’s entire field of view is open sky except for the top of my house and the trees behind it, as seen from the app.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F64e54"&gt;Why am I hammering this point home? Because Starlink’s solution to the line-of-sight issue is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405779/fcc-approves-spacex-starlink-lower-orbits-against-amazon-rival-objections"&gt;put more satellites into space&lt;/a&gt;, and, well, that’s not necessarily great. While Starlink has an army of devoted heart-eyed fans, it has an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18642577/spacex-starlink-satellite-constellation-astronomy-light-pollution"&gt;equal number of critics&lt;/a&gt; in the scientific community who note that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21043229/spacex-starlink-satellite-mega-constellation-concerns-astronomy-space-traffic"&gt;blanketing the sky&lt;/a&gt; with tiny satellites will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;interfere with astronomers&lt;/a&gt; the world over. Starlink satellites are already &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/awestruck-north-texans-mistake-parade-of-starlink-satellites-for-ufos/2626719/"&gt;bright enough to confuse people&lt;/a&gt;, and their potential to interfere with telescopes is well-documented. (No, you &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacexs-dark-satellites-are-still-too-bright-for-astronomers/"&gt;cannot just paint them black&lt;/a&gt; because the idea is to &lt;em&gt;look at space&lt;/em&gt;, not thousands of little black satellites.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPZMWp"&gt;It is a pretty damning indictment of broadband policy in the United States that a lot of people are so desperate for competitive options that they’re like “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/starlink-already-threatens-optical-astronomy-now-radio-astronomers-are-worried"&gt;fuck telescopes&lt;/a&gt;.” But here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UcoeP"&gt;Anyway, once you’ve got everything set up, the Starlink dish sweeps across the sky keeping track with the satellites, so finding a single open spot isn’t enough. You need a wide swath of open sky — Starlink suggests a cone of about 100 degrees, with a minimum elevation of 25 degrees above the horizon. So: low and wide. The app will tell you where and how the view to the satellite is obstructed, by how much, and how many hours a day it will affect your signal. I have my dish 60 feet away from my house with clear views of the sky, and it is still obstructed for two hours a day because of the very top of my house and the trees behind it. If this wasn’t a short-term review, I would certainly have it mounted on a pole on top of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqG23A"&gt;Once you’ve got your dish in a good spot and figured out how to get the cable into your house (another moment when having it permanently attached to the dish is less than ideal, since this will generally require drilling and snaking the cable through a wall), you plug it all in and wait. The dish will rotate around to find a signal and then download the satellite schedule so it can keep itself aligned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G90hpJ"&gt;While that’s happening, the Wi-Fi router will boot itself up (it’s a wee bit slow) and eventually offer you a generic Starlink network. Connect to that, open the Starlink app, and you’ll be given the chance to rename that network and set a Wi-Fi password. And that’s it. It is remarkably simple and easy for a deeply advanced satellite internet system; there is nothing else to configure or otherwise worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="exp8mU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starlink is remarkably easy to set up for such a deeply advanced satellite internet system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AY3DPc"&gt;The included dual-band Wi-Fi 5 router is extremely bare-bones: it has one additional Ethernet port that can support a switch and exactly no listed specifications or software options at all. If you don’t want to use Starlink’s Wi-Fi router, you don’t have to — if your preferred Wi-Fi router supports static routes, you can plug it into the Starlink power box and apparently &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jqhoqz/starlink_app_works_fine_behind_own_router/gby79x1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;use that instead&lt;/a&gt;. (I did not test this because my partner is a literal divorce lawyer, and I was not eager to tell her the Wi-Fi network she relies upon for work would be intermittently brought to a halt by the presence of trees.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Starlink power adapter and Wi-Fi router" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zF7ENiVWm07DWlk9zoK_2jUGJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512188/npatel_20210512_4552_0065.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Starlink power adapter and Wi-Fi router.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="LKIFTN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10499094"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V581M2"&gt;Once you’re all set up and plugged in, there’s not much to say. Starlink offers a moderately fast, very inconsistent broadband connection. I definitely saw speeds that exceeded the promised 100Mbps down, topping out at 222Mbps down and 24Mbps up. But my &lt;em&gt;usual&lt;/em&gt; speeds hovered between 30 and 90 down, &lt;a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/starlink-q1-2021/"&gt;matching what others have&lt;/a&gt; reported, and the connection slowed down and dropped out with surprising frequency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGpbXH"&gt;If Starlink could offer consistently fast speeds, it would be competitive with the fastest package I can get from my rural cable provider, which tops out at $200 / mo for 325 / 25 but is still not attractively priced compared to the services available in more populated areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD20cY"&gt;In my week of testing, Starlink was perfectly fine for anything that buffers — I was able to stream Netflix and Disney Plus in 4K and jump around YouTube videos without significant issues — but doing something faster-paced, like quickly scrolling through TikTok videos, would run into delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehOOg0"&gt;Services that require a sustained, real-time connection, like Slack, Zoom, or gaming, simply weren’t usable for me, even when I was seeing the fastest speeds. I had high hopes that I could spend several days working over Starlink, and after just a few lost Slack messages and Zoom calls where my video dropped to low resolution and then froze entirely, I gave up. Many Starlink beta testers similar report experiences — consistent dropouts of a few seconds, every few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7Tl3W"&gt;Starlink’s latency also swings from fine — Zoom did not exhibit any delay when it worked — to pretty bad. My feeling is that the connection dropouts are going to be worse for gaming than latency, so I didn’t spend any time testing gaming latency, but Starlink itself measures ping times for &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Go&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in its app, and I rarely saw those numbers dip below 50ms, mostly hovering around 85-115ms. Those aren’t numbers you’d want to game with, unless you like losing. (Some Starlink testers have been able to play games and even use Stadia, but that seems both inconsistent and heavily dependent on satellite coverage in your area.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJfgka"&gt;There are no data caps right now, but Starlink is clearly &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd3x2l8/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;thinking about it&lt;/a&gt;, using the same “preventing abuse” language as any other broadband provider. If you are dreaming of signing up for Starlink as a way to tell your local cable monopoly to kick rocks, well, consider what might happen when Starlink is your space-based internet access monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO0W8g"&gt;Look, I know you’re hyped up about Starlink. I feel you. I also wish I could tweet a photo of Dishy in my yard to every telecom CEO in the game and tell them to try harder. But &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has long had a hard rule against reviewing products based on &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; because the sad truth is that most tech products never, ever live up to their potential. And Starlink, judged on its capabilities &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, is simply not a real competitor to the long, long coax wire running from my house to the local cable company fiber plant. It’s not even a great competitor to my data-capped-and-throttled “unlimited” AT&amp;amp;T 5G service because I can reasonably work from home on that connection and I really can’t with Starlink. And in the end, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd40ijs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Starlink’s traffic has to run over fiber in the ground&lt;/a&gt; anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooMTlL"&gt;It feels like we should all be more honest about what this thing can do, what we hope it can do in the future, and why our existing networks aren’t doing that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUWOj1DaeL5aC4jXF15mmihD6zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512181/npatel_20210512_4552_0048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dish needs a completely unobstructed view of the sky to work properly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hbJdOz"&gt;Let’s end this three ways. First, the team at Starlink should be legitimately proud of having shipped this ridiculously complex system, where they’ve gotten it to thus far, and where it might go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exsc6l"&gt;Starlink is a truly remarkable feat of engineering, and the sheer force of will required to make it work as a simple consumer product shines through. It is, however, in everyone’s best interest to consider the trade-offs of having done all this work and putting all these satellites in orbit &lt;em&gt;simply to get internet access&lt;/em&gt;. Astronomers and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/science/space-junk-climate-change.html"&gt;scientists are &lt;em&gt;very mad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about this. Starlink should talk to them more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSnU4U"&gt;Second, all the people dreaming of Starlink upsetting cable monopolies and reinventing broadband need to seriously reset their expectations. At &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;, Starlink currently offers reasonably fast access with inconsistent connectivity, huge latency swings, and a significant uptick in time spent considering whether you can just get out the chainsaw and solve the tree problem yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="5sYmU1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That Starlink even exists is a direct indictment of American broadband policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNnpa7"&gt;Maybe this will change as the company launches more satellites. Maybe it will eventually work better in areas that are dominated by tall trees. Maybe one day it will not drop out in wind and heavy rain. I didn’t give Starlink a formal review score because the whole thing is openly in beta and the company isn’t making many promises about reliability. But even when it’s final, you’re still looking at a service whose near-term, best-case scenario is being competitive with a solid LTE connection. I am no fan of cable companies and wireless carriers, but it’s simply true that my cable broadband and 5G service are both faster and more reliable than Starlink, and they will almost certainly remain that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="b6y4Cu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R3iWDJ"&gt;And lastly, if you are a telecom executive or regulator in the United States, you have no choice but to see Starlink, its execution, and the unrestrained excitement and hype around it as a direct indictment of your rhetoric and efforts to properly connect this country to the internet over the past two decades. Dishy McDishface is a sign that reads YOU FUCKED UP AND EVERYONE HATES YOU. Read the sign. This is your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7hAIK"&gt;As a whole, the American telecom policy industrial complex has utterly failed to put fiber in the ground and signals in the air at fair prices and with good customer support. So much so that a total science project of an internet access system — which involves huge tradeoffs for scientific research and &lt;em&gt;doesn’t work if there are trees in the way —&lt;/em&gt; has captured the attention and imagination of millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm2NfW"&gt;Broadband on the ground is so wrapped up in the lumbering bullshit of monopolistic regulatory capture that it seems easier and more effective to literally launch rockets and try building a network in the sky. Starlink isn’t the happy end result of a commitment to “facility-based competition.” It is thousands of middle fingers pointing at us from the air. It is what happens when there is an &lt;em&gt;utter lack of competition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="F4p64T"&gt;Reality, as they say, bites.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nS6yAp"&gt;The second-generation Apple Pencil, released in 2018, that can magnetically attach to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; tablets that feature USB-C ports &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142085?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_1_1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $20 off at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a relatively small discount on its usual $129 price, but it seems like the best deal on the stylus happening right now. Compared to the infamous first iteration that can only recharge by plugging into a Lightning port, endangering itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;while also looking very silly&lt;/a&gt;, this one charges wirelessly through the side of the iPad Pro or Air. It also supports gesture controls on the side of the Apple Pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="t9Nxyd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; was the biggest game released last week, and you can already get a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=Verge+Deals%2C+4%2F10%2F21&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fsteam-resident-evil-village-resident-evil-8-steam-key-global%2Fgames-federation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hearty $15 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the Steam PC version through digital storefront Eneba. If you want to dive into the first-person horror title and, you know, see the tall lady, head to Eneba, click “Buy Now” on the page, then use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VILLAGEMAYWKND &lt;/strong&gt;to get the game for around $45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5GxIw"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds are at a great price right now at Woot. Normally $200, you can get the black, violet, or silver-colored earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=Verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $30 off&lt;/a&gt; that price. These come with a one-year warranty through Samsung. In &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s review, Chris Welch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;said the Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; “strike a great mix in terms of sound quality, active noise cancellation, and comfort” compared to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E5aNSY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ys4OG5"&gt;The Lectrofan white noise machine is one of my favorite pieces of technology that I bring on every trip away. The black model is $33.38 at Amazon, down from its usual $50 price (via &lt;a href="https://9to5toys.com/2021/05/13/lectrofan-white-noise-machine-deal/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Toys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re someone who has relied on white noise apps on the phone, I highly suggest trying this instead. The Lectrofan doesn’t have any moving parts, unlike some other white noise machines. Instead, it has 20 built-in fan and white noise variations that don’t have an obvious loop cycle, so you probably won’t be able to hear where the cycle ends and begins again, which is a nitpick I have with many free white noise apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to preorder the new black and red DualSense controllers for the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X9GmpiMABYz85aZ-TfDNfrEYa2A=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286642/51176194136_6b76edb34d_h.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new DualSense controller comes in two iterations: Midnight Black and Cosmic Red (pictured). | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OmuplY"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, Sony opted for a less traditional color scheme, one that ditched the classic jet-black exterior found on earlier PlayStation consoles in favor of a black-and-white finish. For some, the new exterior was an acquired taste, as was the matching aesthetic found on the accompanying DualSense controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCG7Rz"&gt;On Thursday, however, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;announced two new color schemes&lt;/a&gt; for the DualSense — at least for those lucky enough to have landed a PS5 console amid the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;supply shortages&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed “midnight black” and “cosmic red,” both controllers offer the same features as the standard DualSense, including a built-in microphone, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;designed to make games more immersive&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IhMwO"&gt; Right now, both are currently available for preorder ahead of their launch on June 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="24HsU8"&gt;Where to buy the midnight black DualSense controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7xnWaI"&gt;Like the standard DualSense controller, the midnight black DualSense will retail for $69.99 at launch. It’s currently available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WL86N5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740477354355271725" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualsense-wireless-controller-midnight-black.3006392" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Direct&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which will ship the controller a week ahead of other retailers on June 11th. It’s not an exact match for previous DualShock controllers — the two-tone design features multiple shades of black and subtle gray detailing — but it’s far closer than the current DualSense, which opts for a white-and-black build. If you’ve wrapped your PS5 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dbrand’s Darkplates&lt;/a&gt;, well now you can have a matching controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rLQI4s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q5loI9"&gt;Where to buy the cosmic red DualSense controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qK2uFS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/05/13/two-new-dualsense-wireless-controller-colors-hit-shelves-starting-next-month/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Sony&lt;/a&gt;, the color palette found on the cosmic red DualSense controller is modeled after the various shades of red scattered throughout the cosmos. That added interstellar inspiration will cost you, however, as the cosmic red edition runs a bit pricier at $74.99. It features a two-tone design like the midnight black DualSense, and it’s currently available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WN6SY2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740477635406853038" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualsense-wireless-controller-cosmic-red.3006393" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Direct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekZqMS"&gt;Like the midnight black model, the red-and-black edition is also slated to ship via PlayStation Direct on June 11th, a week ahead of other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the USPS mail trucks could still go fully electric</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The biggest government fleet is about to start turning over — but the replacements aren’t as green as many hoped&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3J9H7n"&gt;The United States Postal Service (USPS) recently revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;a new mail truck&lt;/a&gt;, which is good because the current ones are prone to breaking down and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3ezx4/post-office-delivery-trucks-keep-catching-on-fire"&gt;catching fire&lt;/a&gt;. But a chorus of people — including members of Congress, environmental groups, and even President Joe Biden — are not happy that most of the replacements will be powered by gasoline, not batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE7d8a"&gt;Sticking with gas doesn’t make much sense in a world where electric vehicles are growing increasingly popular and governments outside the US are laying out timelines for banning gas vehicles. The short stop-and-go routes that most mail carriers take are well-suited for electric vehicles, even ones without an abundance of range. The USPS &lt;a href="https://about.usps.com/what/corporate-social-responsibility/sustainability/report/2020/usps-annual-sustainability-report.pdf"&gt;doesn’t break out its fleet emissions&lt;/a&gt; in its sustainability reports (and it declined to do so when asked), but it’s safe to say switching to electric could help the agency cut way back on fossil fuel usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLEYyd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The current fleet desperately needs to be turned over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPH2mq"&gt;The USPS started the bidding process to replace the current vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/automobiles/the-mail-truck-is-a-classic-and-thats-a-problem-for-a-modern-post-office.html"&gt;a half-decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, when Tesla’s Model S and the Nissan Leaf were some of the only electric vehicles on the market and legacy automakers had yet to announce multibillion-dollar investments into the technology. There was always a chance the contract would go to a bidder that wasn’t focused on new technology. In fact, by the time the USPS put out the final call to bidders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, the competition had essentially narrowed to two companies: Workhorse, a startup with a short and sketchy history that was pitching an all-electric mail truck, and Oshkosh, a defense contracting stalwart. (A third, Turkish vehicle manufacturer Karsan, was considered a long-shot contender.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLk2z4"&gt;Oshkosh won the award in February, which could ultimately be worth some $6 billion. And while it says &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of the mail trucks it builds &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be electric when they hit the road in 2023, neither the company nor the USPS has offered concrete details about how many — or how a defense contractor with no history of making EVs plans to provide them to the largest federal fleet. It took Postmaster General Louis DeJoy getting dragged in front of Congress just to get his estimate that the fleet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300281/usps-new-mail-truck-ev-electric-workhorse-biden-dejoy"&gt;could be around 10 percent EVs&lt;/a&gt;. And even then, he said his agency would need billions more dollars to push that number any higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OqwYI"&gt;Some members of Congress &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/lawmakers-back-8-billion-for-electric-u-s-postal-vehicles"&gt;are willing to do just that&lt;/a&gt; provided they get assurances that the mix of EVs is high. But even if DeJoy gets that money, it’s still not clear what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; can be done, as the whole process played out behind a thick veil of secrecy. (Even email correspondence obtained  via the Freedom of Information Act by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; between the remaining bidders and the USPS across 2020 was almost entirely redacted.) The contract with Oshkosh is currently stuck behind that veil, too, meaning everyone outside the defense contractor and the USPS has been playing a guessing game as to what it entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EkGDcJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This should not be a black box”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48ny2V"&gt;Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) is one member of Congress who has proposed giving more money to the USPS to electrify the fleet. But he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview that he thinks Congress should scrutinize the whole bidding process and that hearings about the award are on the table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsCLGp"&gt;“This should not be a black box where the Postal Service gets to do this without any eyeballs on it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Booming U.S. Recovery Is Leaving Some Communities Completely Behind" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IO0JEi97Z04leDaDUh74CPfdla8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511876/1232710979.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uBgMaP"&gt;The choice to go with Oshkosh &lt;a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-urge-president-review-postal-vehicle-contract"&gt;may have been a deliberate move&lt;/a&gt; by DeJoy (a Trump-era holdover) to ruin Biden’s push to electrify the government fleet. Or it could just be an unsurprising but suboptimal outcome at the end of a long and &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;tortured&lt;/a&gt; government contracting process. After all, competing bidders with hybrid or alternative fuel prototypes dropped out before the final stage, and Oshkosh was arguably the most reasonable choice that remained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ04jw"&gt;That’s because Workhorse does not have a robust track record. Founded in 1998 as a commercial van manufacturer, the original version of Workhorse made gas and diesel vehicles and was later bought by trucking giant Navistar in 2005. Navistar eventually sold Workhorse to a company that retrofitted combustion engine cars with EV powertrains called AMP Electric Vehicles &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prweb.com%2Freleases%2F2013%2F3%2Fprweb10527832.htm&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22423179%2Fusps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and AMP subsequently took on the Workhorse name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QWF1ds"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Workhorse was pitching an EV, but it doesn’t have a robust track record&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJtygD"&gt;This new-look Workhorse was able to land some small-scale partnerships with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17040180/ups-electric-delivery-trucks"&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ryder.com/solutions/fleet-leasing/advanced-vehicle-technology/workhorse-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; for an electric delivery van it had in development, but the company bled money following the combination with AMP. To stay afloat, it leveraged its patents and other assets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;in exchange for loans from Marathon Asset Management&lt;/a&gt;, a hedge fund known for investing in distressed companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJq28L"&gt;It wasn’t until Workhorse’s former CEO, Steve Burns, left in 2019 to found a new company called Lordstown Motors that things got less dire. Lordstown Motors bought the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;recently shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, plant from General Motors&lt;/a&gt; — a move praised by then-President Trump — and paid Workhorse millions of dollars to license intellectual property for an electric pickup truck that was in development. Workhorse also got an equity stake, which is now valued at around $200 million after Lordstown Motors went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOKcFZ"&gt;Still, Workhorse has no experience building electric vehicles in high volumes. That may be why it was considering outsourcing the USPS contract. According to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000162828020003532/wkhs-2019x10kxex1041xi.htm"&gt;filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC), Workhorse had guaranteed Lordstown Motors the right to bid on manufacturing the mail truck, though it said it would consider other contract manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmVcyw"&gt;Lordstown Motors has yet to put its pickup truck into production, and there are questions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;about the progress it’s making&lt;/a&gt;. It’s impossible to say whether Workhorse’s inexperience or its plan to outsource manufacturing played into the USPS’s decision to go with Oshkosh. But Rep. Ryan, who has voiced a lot of support for Lordstown Motors, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he views Workhorse’s relationship with the startup as a potential boon — not a drawback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgaGdu"&gt;“The platform they’ve developed is so far advanced from [where it was at] the beginning of the contract,” Ryan said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Endurance All-Electric Pickup Truck Reveal Event" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCWjnUKGChBCXw-oi5WYvrlutfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511938/1222922470.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mwf2QF"&gt;Ryan isn’t the only one applying pressure. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) also &lt;a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/kaptur-introduces-resolution-calling-halt-usps-oshkosh-contract-light"&gt;introduced a resolution in March&lt;/a&gt; meant to halt the award until an investigation can be done. And Biden has continued to express his desire for the entire federal fleet to be replaced with electric vehicles as part of his massive infrastructure overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ti7G21"&gt;The best hope for reversing or amending the award may lie in the USPS’s still-secret contract with Oshkosh. If that contract has what is known as a “termination for convenience” clause, the USPS could get out of it for almost any reason, a person who has worked in government contracting told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The agency would not be subject to claims of breach of contract or damages and would only have to pay termination costs. And since the USPS has so far only publicly committed to funding more of Oshkosh’s design work and scaling up some of its manufacturing, that may not be such a huge bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KapSrW"&gt;It’s possible the contract instead has what’s known as a “liquidated damages clause,” which typically lays out how either side can get out of the deal, this person says. (There could be language that says the USPS has to pay certain amounts depending on how many days’ notice it gives Oshkosh that it’s canceling the deal, for example.) This isn’t as standard as the termination for convenience clause, but it has shown up in postal contracts past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8HWAhh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Any changes to Oshkosh’s mail truck could hinge on the language of the secret contract&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WXMbxy"&gt;Another possibility is that the USPS’s board of governors may still hold sway over the contract. The board approves all of the postal service’s large capital investments, and while it may have already made some approvals that allowed the USPS to move forward with Oshkosh, there could be more approvals waiting — especially since the full award doesn’t seem to have been granted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua027S"&gt;The board of governors is also the sole entity with the power to remove DeJoy, though right now, that board is not operating at its full nine-member capacity. Biden has nominated three new members that would fill it back out and give it — on paper at least — a 5-4 Democratic majority. But it’s not certain that they would replace the Trump-era holdover, and at least one of the nominees has pledged to try to work with DeJoy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8SrCF"&gt;(The USPS declined to go into specifics on the Oshkosh contract. “The Postal Service recognizes that powertrain technology may change significantly over the available 20-year life of the [new vehicle], and as such, the USPS selected a flexible design platform that can accommodate advancements in technology,” a spokesperson said in a statement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPmVDc"&gt;There’s also the possibility that Workhorse will formally challenge the contract, either through the USPS’s own internal appeals process or with a more public contest — similar to how Blue Origin is fighting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;NASA’s recent lunar lander award to SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; or how Amazon challenged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423312/pentagon-microsoft-jedi-amazon-trump-defense-contract-cloud-bezos"&gt;Microsoft’s cloud computing contract with the Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQuHjS"&gt;A reversal may not be needed, though. The USPS has only committed to investing $482 million so far, which Oshkosh is supposed to use to “finalize the production design” of the vehicle. Oshkosh has agreed to make between 50,000 and 165,000 trucks over 10 years. The USPS has also been careful to say that the current fleet will be replaced with not only the new mail truck, but also what it refers to as “commercial off the shelf” vehicles (which are typically the larger USPS-branded vans and trucks you may see in your neighborhood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7eqyS"&gt;“That does suggest there’s a lot of latitude and optionality, and that’s pretty common with these types of contracts,” Ben Prochazka, the national director of nonprofit Electrification Coalition, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBs9fp"&gt;Jimmy O’Dea, a senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, agrees. It’s relatively early on in the sense that the contract was just awarded,” he said in an interview. “What strikes me is the first part of the award is a $500 million component just to finish designing the vehicle. I guess that part gives me hope that things aren’t so baked they can’t be undone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_gC-YRUVC0rmGhLxZ2h1sEXBEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22323886/suburb2_9_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zFSzDV"&gt;In November 2020, Oshkosh warned investors in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000775158/000156459020054491/osk-10k_20200930.htm"&gt;a filing with the SEC&lt;/a&gt; that it “may not have the expertise or resources” to compete in a world that is increasingly reliant on electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OX7t5x"&gt;“While we are continuing to explore options to offer more propulsion choices in our products, such as electric-powered vehicles or mobile equipment, with lower emissions, this may require us to spend additional funds on product research and development and implementation costs and subject us to the risk that our competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRKhLs"&gt;While these so-called risk factors are included to make sure shareholders and potential investors are aware of the worst-case scenarios a company faces, that language still represents an admission that Oshkosh makes its bones on internal combustion engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfyYGk"&gt;In fact, through most of the bidding process, Oshkosh was assumed to only be working on an internal combustion option based on Ford’s Transit van. The most recent &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/"&gt;spy shots&lt;/a&gt; of that prototype showed a much bulkier vehicle than what’s in the computer-generated images released in February when the award was announced. (Ford has repeatedly declined to comment on whether it remains involved with Oshkosh.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QndPEL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We won this fairly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FBXQCQ"&gt;How Oshkosh’s bid changed so dramatically in the closing months is yet another mystery. The company has crucially failed to explain how it plans to make its mail truck convertible to electric power, or what those conversions will cost, or who will foot the bill. And it hasn’t backed up its &lt;a href="https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/news/2-23-21-usps"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that the gas versions will “fuel-efficient low-emission” with any actual numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApgrYc"&gt;Still, CEO John Pfeifer defended the contract on &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/oshkosh-takes-victory-lap-over-postal-service-delivery-truck-contract"&gt;a recent investor call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72r3Bw"&gt;“I emphasize that we won this program. It was a five-year process, and we won this fairly,” he said. “We know how to compete for government programs. It’s one of the things we know how to do. We won it fairly, and we won it because we have the best solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UmOfK"&gt;Pfeifer also said he believes Congress does not want to change the contract. Rather, he said the conversation in Congress has “been about increasing the rate of introduction of electric vehicles. It’s about how quickly [the Postal Service] can get the infrastructure up and running to recharge electric vehicles. But that will not delay this program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEGSQOUB0NtZ55cETu0Q2b8yEEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514220/NGDVsideView_scaled_bgresized.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ER0AEZ"&gt;Oshkosh’s mail truck has &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/lets-do-a-quick-design-evaluation-of-this-new-postal-ve-1846347843"&gt;a lot of sorely needed improvements&lt;/a&gt;, like advanced safety features, better &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2021/02/usps-new-truck-design-safety.html"&gt;visibility for the driver&lt;/a&gt;, and air conditioning. They will also — hopefully — be less likely to catch fire. Still, the USPS stands to benefit from increasing its reliance on electric mail trucks, regardless of who makes them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8QzXf"&gt;Electric vehicles require less maintenance, which means it costs less to keep them running. The USPS is currently spending some $700 million per year &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;on maintenance alone&lt;/a&gt;. Switching to electric mail trucks could therefore theoretically save money and keep the trucks running longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="ueqYCJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ncoA2"&gt;“For an institution that prides itself on working through rain or snow, this is an opportunity to say, also, ‘without mechanical failure,’” Prochazka said. He also said electric mail trucks could help the USPS’s bottom line because the price of electricity tends to be far more stable than the price of oil. “You have a lot more opportunity to insulate against price shocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tR0s8n"&gt;The USPS needs every last dollar it can save, too, in order to compete in an ever-crowding industry for package deliveries. And those competitors? They’re all going electric. FedEx and UPS have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311210/fedex-carbon-neutral-2040-2-billion-electric-vehicles-planes"&gt;made big claims&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://arrival.com/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles"&gt;turning over their fleets&lt;/a&gt; to electric vans and trucks, and Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric vans from Rivian and is now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;a part-owner&lt;/a&gt; of the EV startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GY2EOV"&gt;“The more and more people hear about this, the more ridiculous it sounds,” Ryan said. “It confirms what people’s view is of the stereotype of government: ‘let’s double down on the past.’ Governments need to be about the future, so we want to continue to generate public support for this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xq81R3"&gt;Katy Perry’s latest video features an electric rat. The pop star released her new video for the single “Electric,” which is a surprisingly charming coming-of-age story about growing up with Pikachu as a best friend. It features a young Perry and her Pichu struggling early on in her career, while the current version of the star and Pikachu watch on, &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;-style. (In a curious twist, the video was directed by Carlos López Estrada, who also wrote and directed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315306/disney-raya-and-the-last-dragon-southeast-asian-media"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IDAANy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Pokémon’s 25th anniversary: celebrating more than two decades of pocket monsters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tRYzNn"&gt;It may sound like a strange crossover, but it’s all part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228760/pokemon-25th-anniversary-katy-perry"&gt;Pokémon’s music-focused 25th anniversary celebration&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/25/22300982/post-malone-pokemon-25th-anniversary-hootie-blowfish-cover"&gt;Post Malone released a baffling cover of Hootie and the Blowfish’s 1992 hit “Only Wanna Be With You,”&lt;/a&gt; which was followed by a surreal virtual concert. You can watch the full thing below to see a Gyarados jump over Post while he sings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GHfWSd"&gt;Of course, this is all part of a burgeoning convergence between music and gaming, which accelerated after live events were largely put on hold due to the pandemic. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott performed a series of concerts in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;Lil Nas X took the stage in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21219197/minecraft-american-football-concert-anamanaguchi-openpit-fortnite-festivals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; was home to a mini music festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Veritone launches new platform to let celebrities and influencers clone their voice with AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wludd7lICN-yAOnVjUU9knWzevc=/130x0:1750x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286408/Screen_Shot_2021_05_14_at_12.10.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HdL4OE"&gt;Recording advertisements and product endorsements can be lucrative work for celebrities and influencers. But is it too much like hard work? That’s what US firm Veritone is betting. Today, the company is launching a new platform called &lt;a href="http://Marvel.AI"&gt;Marvel.AI&lt;/a&gt; that will let creators, media figures, and others generate deepfake clones of their voice to license as they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5PF0A"&gt;“People want to do these deals but they don’t have enough time to go into a studio and produce the content,” Veritone president Ryan Steelberg tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Digital influencers, athletes, celebrities, and actors: this is a huge asset that’s part of their brand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMaAzY"&gt;With Marvel.AI, he says, anyone can create a realistic copy of their voice and deploy it as they see fit. While celebrity Y is sleeping, their voice might be out and about, recording radio spots, reading audiobooks, and much more. Steelberg says the platform will even be able to resurrect the voices of the dead, using archive recordings to train AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdMPkO"&gt;“Whoever has the copyright to those voices, we will work with them to bring them to the marketplace,” he says. “That will be up to the rightsholder and what they feel is appropriate, but hypothetically, yes, you could have Walter Cronkite reading the nightly news again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VgBBkA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/548660025?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8F96tw"&gt;Speech synthesis has improved rapidly in recent years, with machine learning techniques enabling the creation of ever-more realistic voices. (Just think about the difference between how Apple’s Siri sounded when it launched in 2011 and how it sounds &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nkNcb_XNbFI?t=107"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;.) Many big tech firms like Amazon offer off-the-shelf text-to-speech models that generate voices at scale that are robotic but not unpleasant. But new companies are also making boutique voice clones that sound like specific individuals, and the results can be near-indistinguishable from the real thing. Just listen to this voice &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DWK_iYBl8cA"&gt;clone&lt;/a&gt; of podcaster Joe Rogan, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk2fUv"&gt;It’s this leap forward in quality that motivated Veritone to create Marvel.AI, says Steelberg, as well as the potential for synthetic speech to dovetail with the firm’s existing businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0f8DpS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Veritone places more than 75,000 ads in podcasts monthly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTISOz"&gt;Although Veritone markets itself as an “AI company,” a big part of its revenue apparently comes from old-school advertising and content licensing. As Steelberg explains, its advertising subsidiary Veritone One is heavily invested in the podcast space, and every month places more than 75,000 “ad integrations” with influencers. “It’s mostly native integrations, like product placements,” he says. “It’s getting the talent to voice sponsorships and commercials. That’s extremely effective but very expensive and time consuming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IC3U2l"&gt;Another part of the firm, Veritone Licensing, licenses video from a number of major archives. These include archives owned by broadcasters like CBS and CNN and sports organizations like the NCAA and US Open. “When you see the Apollo moon landing footage show up in movies, or Tiger words content in a Nike commercial, all that’s coming through Veritone,” says Steelberg. It’s this experience with licensing and advertising that will give Veritone the edge over AI startups focusing purely on technology, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4HE5P"&gt;To customers, Marvel.AI will offer two streams. One will be a self-service model, where anyone can pick from a catalog of pre-generated voices and create speech on demand. (This is how Amazon, Microsoft, et al. have been doing it for years.) But the other stream — “the focus,” says Steelberg — will be a “managed, white-glove approach,” where customers submit training data, and Veritone will create a voice clone just for them. The resulting models will be stored on Veritone’s systems and available to generate audio as and when the client wants. Marvel.AI will also function as a marketplace, allowing potential buyers to submit requests to use these voices. (How all this will be priced isn’t yet clear.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cda4ki"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Veritone has yet to prove its AI voices are worth the effort&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6w4A1"&gt;Steelberg is convincing that the demand for these voices exists and that Veritone’s business model is ready to go. But one major factor will decide whether Marvel.AI succeeds: the quality of the AI voices the platform can generate. And this is much less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuEhe0"&gt;When asked for examples of the company’s work, Veritone shared three short clips with &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;each a single line endorsement for a brand of mints. The first line is read by Steelberg himself, the second by his AI clone, and the third by a gender-swapped voice. You can listen to all three below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p9aDeS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Veritone Marvel AI Speech Synthesis|102118" data-volume-uuid="7808acc72" data-volume-id="102118" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-760" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LMlnTJ"&gt;The AI clone is, to my ear at least, a pretty good imitation, though not a perfect copy. It’s flatter and more clipped than the real thing. But it’s also not a full demonstration of what voices can do during an endorsement. Steelberg’s delivery lacks the enthusiasm and verve you’d expect of a real ad (we’re not faulting him for this — he’s an executive, not a voice actor), and so it’s not clear if Veritone’s voice models can capture a full range of emotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpGeHK"&gt;It’s also not a great sign that the voiceover for the platform’s sizzle reel (embedded at the top of the story) was done by Steelberg himself rather than an AI copy. Either the company didn’t think a voice clone was good enough for the job, or it ran out of time to generate one — either way, it’s not a great endorsement of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpAlHO"&gt;The technology is moving quickly, though, and Steelberg is keen to stress that Veritone has the resources and expertise to adopt whatever new machine learning models emerge in the years to come. Where it’s going to differentiate itself, he says, is managing the experience of customers and clients into actually deploying synthetic speech at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EP8l4L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Synthetic content will raise lots of questions about authenticity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LrujA3"&gt;One problem Steelberg offers is how synthetic speech might dilute the power of endorsements. After all, the attraction of product endorsement hinges on the belief (however delusional) that this or that celebrity really does enjoy this particular brand of cereal / toothpaste / life insurance. If the celeb can’t be bothered to voice the endorsement themselves, doesn’t it take away from the ad’s selling power? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3HnbY"&gt;Steelberg’s solution is to create an industry standard for disclosure — some sort of audible tone that plays before synthetic speech to a) let listeners know it’s not a real voice, and b) reassure them that the voice’s owner endorses this use. “It’s not just about avoiding the negative connotations of tricking the consumer, but also wanting them to be confident that [this or that celebrity] really approved this synthetic content,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YscHAv"&gt;It’s questions like these that are going to be increasingly important as synthetic content becomes more common, and it’s clear Veritone has been thinking hard about these issues. Now the company just needs to convince the influencers, athletes, actors, podcasters, and celebrities of the world to lend it their voices. &lt;/p&gt;
