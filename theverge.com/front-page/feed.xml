    <title>Thanks to the Rickroll, ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ hits 1 billion YouTube plays</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0sSB6w"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt; for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up” has surpassed 1 billion plays on YouTube. The song became a lasting part of internet culture thanks to the Rickroll meme and reached the impressive milestone a couple days ago. Astley took to the video’s comments to share his gratitude, saying “amazing, crazy, wonderful!” In a video posted to Instagram, he added “the world is a wonderful and beautiful place, and I am very lucky.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rE9AtU"&gt;With some songs having crossed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk"&gt;as many as 7 billion views&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, the 1 billion club isn’t quite as prestigious as it once was. But the achievement goes to show the staying power of the Rickroll prank. The video hit daily views of 2.3 million on April Fools Day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9607871/rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-video-billion-views/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just in the past couple years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138550/fortnite-rickroll-new-emote-never-gonna-give-you-up-rick-astley"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; emotes&lt;/a&gt; and fan-made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22289657/never-gonna-give-you-up-4k"&gt;4K remasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vctDWy"&gt;Back in 2008, the man himself &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL-hNMJvcyI"&gt;Rickrolled the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade&lt;/a&gt;. The meme was also put to excellent use when the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDs7KkGcQ6M"&gt;San Diego Padres trolled the Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; just as fans thought they were about to belt out the chorus to “Sweet Caroline.” If you’ve got other prime examples, the comments section awaits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joVsmq"&gt;I’m curious what the average watch time is for “Never Gonna Give You Up.” After being duped, how many people have closed out the window in aggravation within seconds of hearing the drum intro and synths coming in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="874YsE"&gt;Astley celebrated joining the billion plays club by releasing a limited, &lt;a href="https://rickastley.tmstor.es/?lf=f8891a33f848b3f0690358b04f4f6543"&gt;already-sold-out&lt;/a&gt; run of 7-inch blue vinyl pressings of the quintessential ‘80s jam. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A starter pack of Nanoleaf’s stunning canvas panels is $50 off at Costco today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KRU0SgGVT1IzFaLp41a3jV_Y3A=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69660862/Nanoleaf_Canvas_Light_Panel_Lifestyle_Image__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nanoleaf’s canvas light panels are easy to set up and can display more than 16 million colors. | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqYYzg"&gt;If you like your lighting to be on the adventurous side, rest assured that Nanoleaf’s canvas light panels aren’t made to be subtle. The touch-sensitive squares are flashy and versatile, with the ability to display more than 16 million colors and a modular design that lets you place them in a variety of patterns. The bright LED panels also work with all the major smart home platforms, and can cycle through a number of preset colors or respond to sound when in “Rhythm Mode,” a feature that’s just as suited for the ambient noise outside your bedroom as your favorite record. Right now, Costco members can purchase &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/nanoleaf-canvas-light-panels---smarter-kit.product.100743148.html"&gt;Nanoleaf’s Canvas Light Panel smarter pack&lt;/a&gt; with nine panels and everything needed to get started for $50, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the intuitive lighting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0O0A5M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677730"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="g49kkM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nanoleaf’s light-up wall panels now look like wood accent pieces","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2kLWbr"&gt;The Razer Nari Essential is by no means a groundbreaking headset, yet, for the price, it’s an admirable entry-level model that will appease most gamers, especially on the PC side. The jet-black wireless gaming headset features an adjustable headband, a sturdy build, and support for both PC and PlayStation consoles, with THX Spatial Audio simulated surround sound available on the former. Normally $100, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13140756?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Frazer-nari-essential-gaming-headset-21" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Woot for $55&lt;/a&gt;, more than 45 percent off its typical list price. If Razer’s budget-friendly Nari Essential doesn’t offer what you’re looking for, however, we’ve also rounded up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;best gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt; overall, including multiplatform models and both wired and wireless alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LbANK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qexkJ"&gt;Good noise-cancellation can be hard to come by for $100 — just look at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, there’s the second-gen Amazon Echo Buds, a pair of true wireless earbuds that churn out satisfying sound while benefitting from improved comfort and noise cancellation over their first-gen counterpart. Amazon’s mid-range earbuds, which are now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747338177907879421#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for a limited time at Best Buy for $80&lt;/a&gt;, also feature IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and allow for hands-free voice commands via Alexa, meaning Amazon’s virtual assistant is always available at the tip of your tongue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram’s group video calls can now have up to 1,000 viewers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/moIVKgHFAindUOothSOS02MVO8E=/0x25:2006x1362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69660642/Screen_Shot_2021_07_31_at_10.02.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sL4whk"&gt;Telegram has announced &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;the latest new features and improvements&lt;/a&gt; making their way to the popular messaging app. Video is the focus this time around. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat"&gt;launching group video calls last month&lt;/a&gt;, those sessions are now able to tally up to 1,000 viewers. The maximum number of people able to participate and broadcast to the video call remains at 30, but you can have quite the audience now for “anything from online lectures to live rap battles,” according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYioAW"&gt;Video messages will also now come through at a higher resolution, and you can tap them for a larger view of the clip. When recording your own video messages, Telegram says that audio from your device will now keep playing as you do so, “so you can now sing along to your favorite songs or reply without pausing your podcast.” You can now zoom in when recording with your phone’s rear camera, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cr7RLM"&gt;Other additions include screen sharing for one-on-one video calls (with audio from the device of whoever’s broadcasting), the option to auto-delete messages after a month — the longest option &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301393/telegram-auto-delete-messages-widgets-andoird-ios-update"&gt;was previously a week&lt;/a&gt; — and more precise drawing. Telegram has also spruced up the user experience with animations for the passcode screen and when you send messages on Android; iOS users already got these message animations in a previous update. For the full list of changes, head over to &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;Telegram’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>K-pop’s fandom platforms are changing what it means to be an idol</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lsCxyBrHQ7kvucqQYFMCy9KkK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69660335/VRG_4679_KPOP_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Digital fan clubs are turning into single-purpose social networks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="8AEgCl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Pc6nDb"&gt;Fandom has changed a lot since I was a kid. As a tween, I had no hope of getting in touch with celebrities I adored like Britney Spears and Whitney Houston. Now, I’ve not only spoken with some of my celebrity favorites on social media, but I’ve even fought with a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UhspD"&gt;The technology of fandom is changing, too. Parasocial relationships — a largely one-sided relationship between a fan and a public figure they feel close to due to social media — are everywhere online. And the companies behind some of the biggest acts in K-pop are pioneering a new way to monetize them. They’ve developed online platforms to help K-pop fans feel as though they have direct access to their idol favorites. That access helps shape the way these fans interact with the idol as a form of friendship &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how they engage with other fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UHHumY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three main platforms now stand out: Universe, Weverse, and LYSN&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYQ8AO"&gt;Before the rise of social media accounts and company-run platforms, most fans for Korean artists basically were locked into direct engagement through &lt;a href="http://www.thekrazemagazine.com/latest-updates/2020/3/15/fancafes-and-why-they-are-such-a-headache"&gt;fancafes&lt;/a&gt; — a kind of digital fan club that often required fans to prove their knowledge of a particular artist before gaining access to artists. Initially hosted on platforms like social networking site &lt;a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/DaumCafe?lang=en"&gt;DAUM&lt;/a&gt;, these fancafes allowed fans to connect with idols directly, and they could become even more intimate when connected with the official paid fan club memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar0Ejm"&gt;While the DAUM fancafes for many idols are still up and running, there has been a shift away from them over the past two years, especially for English-language fandoms. In their place, several companies have created new social apps for their artists, entirely bypassing third-party platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Three main platforms now stand out: NCSoft’s Universe is used by a wide range of groups managed by companies outside of the &lt;a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2021/03/30/entertainment/kpop/SM-entertainment-JYP-entertainment-YG-entertainment/20210330160916443.html"&gt;Big Four&lt;/a&gt; of Korean pop music and includes features like a “private messaging” service, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/3/22311645/deepfake-ai-k-pop-stars-ncsoft-universe-music-industry"&gt;exclusive music&lt;/a&gt;, and mildly controversial AI-generated voice calls with idols. HYBE’s Weverse is home to mega-groups like BTS and TXT and structured more like the DAUM fancafes. Finally, there’s SM’s LYSN, which includes the truly innovative Bubble app that has found a way to give K-pop groups all of the benefits of Twitter DMs, without many of the problems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbTsFt"&gt;SM is a K-pop-producing powerhouse behind groups like TVXQ and the cyberpunk girl group Aespa. Its platform, LYSN, first launched in 2018 as an “interest-based fan community.” It was a relative failure before the 2020 introduction of its Bubble&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;idol instant messaging service, which &lt;a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/news/heres-much-money-sm-entertainment-made-fans-application-lysn-bubble/"&gt;kicked profits into the stratosphere&lt;/a&gt;. With the different versions of Bubble, fans can contact their favorite idols through partially private messaging, paid for on a subscription basis. The app is designed to look like a one-on-one chat window, but the reality is more like a massive group chat, with the idol &lt;a href="http://www.lysn.com/en_US/faq/21129452"&gt;dropping in messages for thousands of fans at once&lt;/a&gt; and seeing replies as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TC99md"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It can feel like you are receiving a personal, private message from the idol.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEIqr5"&gt;Areum Jeong, assistant professor of humanities at Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute, says the apps offer fans a real chance to strengthen their relationship with their current favorite idols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpO5ij"&gt;“Fans are fully aware that it is technically a group chat where the idol will receive messages from thousands of fans, although fans cannot see the other fans’ messages,” says Jeong. “Even so, fans enjoy receiving messages where the idol shares his / her daily life and thoughts. And at times, it can feel like you are receiving a personal, private message from the idol because the interface gives an illusion of a 1:1 chat, and some idols will send messages that cater to intimate feelings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjjGZy"&gt;That faux-intimacy can be a powerful force for fans who use these platforms regularly. “I like using Weverse specifically because I love seeing member interactions in a seemingly authentic way,” says Leigh, a fan of idol group Seventeen who connects with the group through Weverse. “It is fun to see members in basically a glorified group chat that, from time to time, it feels like I am an observer of, but most of the time, I feel like I am a participant in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="P6PStU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The relationship between BTS and ARMY never feels one-sided.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqhl0O"&gt;Part of the appeal is that fans can feel as though they’re seeing a different, more personal side to the idol they’re following on less direct platforms like Twitter or Instagram. For Nicole Santero, a PhD student currently doing research on the culture on BTS’s massive international fan base ARMY (and who runs &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ResearchBTS"&gt;the @ResearchBTS Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;), it’s all about the connections that fans can make in their interactions with the artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLciOV"&gt;“The relationship between BTS and ARMY never feels one-sided. What has stood out about Weverse is how BTS is so active and often responds directly to fans on the app,” says Santero. “That makes Weverse even more appealing, and there is definitely this greater intimacy and closeness formed between artists and fans through these types of interactions. Knowing that BTS could potentially see your posts makes the experience even more meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3DEvw"&gt;These company-run apps don’t just offer fans the ability to receive comfort from the artist. For some fans, the appeal is in getting to offer support when an artist is going through a health issue, a scandal, or simply when they’re bored on their rare downtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbSC3Z"&gt;For Maxim, an Australian Stray Kids fan who’s been using the Bubble app for six months, it’s been a mix of good times and bad times. “The Great Hyunjin Incident of ’21 was a bit of a tumultuous time for that whole band / fandom, and I do admit that I sent a little buck-up message of encouragement through to Felix,” he said, referring to group member Felix. “Other times, I’ve replied to messages when Felix asks for recommendations and try to sneak my taste onto his agenda. Again, there’s genuinely no way to know if he ever sees it. Would he even watch &lt;em&gt;Yuri on Ice&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sk8 the Infinity&lt;/em&gt;?” (I think he probably would.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Ujjd"&gt;Unlike past fan clubs for other celebrities, there’s no guarantee that what happens on company-run apps will stay on those apps. In fact, due to the medium to low quality of in-app translation services to translate from Korean to English, there are &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tamarherman/2020/08/20/the-unpaid-labor-of-k-pop-fan-translation-twitter/"&gt;translation accounts&lt;/a&gt; for many of the artists across these platforms that focus exclusively on Weverse / LYSN and Bubble / Universe. If an idol’s fan base is small or poorly organized outside of the company-run platform, they may have fewer translation accounts. However, that doesn’t stop fans from sharing memes, artist-uploaded selfies, and clips from livestreams everywhere that they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PxWf9"&gt;There can be a hard edge to that intimacy. “As more fans than ever view themselves as active consumers, they can be unreasonable or even hostile,” says Jeong. Fans of rookie idol group Enhypen have been &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/k-pop-group-enhypen-fandom-racism"&gt;dealing with a fractured fandom&lt;/a&gt; following a member potentially saying the n-word, and much of the conflict between fans stems from interactions on Weverse. Fans on the platform tried to hide violent and racist posts from the artist using an in-app feature for inter-fan communication and ended up attacking Black fans speaking out about the incident and then about the harassment they were facing. Within hours of the initial wave of harassment, Black fans of the group took to Twitter and TikTok to share what they were seeing and how people were talking about them — especially in the face of continued silence from the group, their management, and Weverse moderation. The app they’d been using to connect with other fans and the idols themselves was no longer the safe space it had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6od9Rm"&gt;Still, none of these engagements would have been easy 10 years ago, and most would have been flat-out impossible 10 years before that. These platforms offer an entirely new way for celebrities and their fans to interact, building on conventional social media platforms but increasingly distinct from them. And for better or worse, it’s changing what it means to be a fan — or an idol — online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd1sTZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tc9A40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You might want to avoid the gobs of Halo Infinite spoilers Microsoft just leaked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JvSqgRyyr1wHNYz5sTHMpSMzU0=/9x0:1805x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659239/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjNZiO"&gt;If you’re invested in the story of Master Chief, Cortana, and the fate of the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe, you might want to keep your head down and start muting some keywords on social media until &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;arrives later this year — because vast spoilers for the game’s entire story are now floating around on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15LuYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: we’ll be keeping this post spoiler-free, though&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCXB8a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; creative director Joseph Staten &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joestaten?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1421244308766674947%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22602811%2Fhalo-infinite-story-spoiler-leak-cortana-technical-preview"&gt;confirmed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft accidentally leaked “a small number of Halo Infinite campaign files” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597498/halo-infinite-multiplayer-technical-preview-beta-july-29th"&gt;when it launched the game’s first multiplayer beta yesterday on July 29th&lt;/a&gt;, saying they “can ruin the campaign experience for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xn4x6X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Leaks like this are painful for the dev team and can ruin the campaign experience for everyone. So please, keep you eyes peeled for spoilers and don't spread them if you see them.❤️ 2/2&lt;/p&gt;— Joseph Staten (@joestaten) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joestaten/status/1421244308766674947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykslJx"&gt;As far as we can tell, that’s no exaggeration — we found a plaintext dump on the web with over 800 strings of text that appear to be from &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign. They seem to describe both your in-game objectives, and basic descriptions of the plot, all the way through the end of the story. (At least one of them literally describes a plot twist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gcSJB"&gt;We’re not linking to the strings, though they’re not terribly hard to find if you really want to spoil the campaign. But if, instead, you’re trying to keep spoilers away, might we suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144097/twitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to-settings-phone-desktop"&gt;our guide on how to mute words on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o25dBQ"&gt;In lighter &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; news, developer 343 Industries recently revealed &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-has-drop-weapon-button-so-dont-kill-me-t-1847386144"&gt;you’ll finally have a “drop weapon” button&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully leading to fewer randos teamkilling you just to claim your sniper rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the latest accusations Activision Blizzard employees have leveled at the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HBIMFsryuO-8F5cJ03oFUxahr68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659148/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SvzE3g"&gt;More disturbing allegations of Activision Blizzard’s reported culture of sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination have been reported in recent days, following a huge lawsuit filed against the company by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883FDU"&gt;Details in these stories may be challenging to read, so we are prefacing them with &lt;strong&gt;a content warning for descriptions of sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdUGx3"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/activision-walkout-metoo-call-of-duty.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; posted a story&lt;/a&gt; of extremely distressing accounts of Activision Blizzard’s culture. Here is one from Shay Stein, a former customer service employee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rV3iMZ"&gt;Ms. Stein, 28, who worked at Activision from 2014 to 2017 in a customer service role, helping gamers with problems and glitches, said she had consistently been paid less than her ex-boyfriend, who joined the company at the same time she did and performed the same work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elkVBU"&gt;Ms. Stein said she had once declined drugs that her manager offered at a holiday party in 2014 or 2015, which soured their relationship and hampered her career. In 2016, a manager messaged her on Facebook, suggesting she must be into “some freaky stuff” and asking what type of pornography she watched. She said she had also overheard male colleagues joking that some women had their jobs only because they performed sexual favors for male superiors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RanNHC"&gt;And former vice president Lisa Welch shared an account of how an exec asked her to have sex with him “because she ‘deserved to have some fun’ after her boyfriend had died weeks earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxc9uQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aq4vv/blizzard-recruiters-asked-hacker-if-she-liked-being-penetrated-at-job-fair"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; published a disturbing report&lt;/a&gt; on Friday about the story of Emily Mitchell, a security researcher, who approached Blizzard’s booth at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in 2015 and was harassed by Blizzard’s representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VPAjvq"&gt;When she got to the table, she said she asked about the penetration testing position. Penetration testing, or pentesting, is the industry term for a security audit. Mitchell said she was wearing a t-shirt made by cybersecurity company SecureState, which had “Penetration Expert” on the front. One of the Blizzard employees first asked if she was lost, another one asked if she was at the conference with her boyfriend, and another one asked if she even knew what pentesting was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B315Gt"&gt;“One of them asked me when was the last time I was personally penetrated, if I liked being penetrated, and how often I got penetrated,” Mitchell told Waypoint. “I was furious and felt humiliated so I took the free swag and left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wcBAp4"&gt;Mitchell would later work as the COO at a company called Sagitta HPC (now Terahash), and when Blizzard wanted to hire the company in 2017, she reported the incident to founder and CEO Jeremi Gosney, according to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;. Gosney posted his redacted email reply &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/839727489635209216"&gt;on Twitter in March 2017&lt;/a&gt;, demanding that Blizzard fulfill several conditions if they were to work together, including a “50 percent misogyny tax” where the proceeds would be donated to three charities supporting women in technology, and that Blizzard send a letter of apology to Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VqI6Yn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not going to name-and-shame, but "Don't Be a Dick" is globally applicable. There are repercussions. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenintech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#womenintech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternationalWomensDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#InternationalWomensDay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Wcds3a2bnA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Wcds3a2bnA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeremi M. Gosney (@jmgosney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/839727489635209216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVbwuO"&gt;Gosney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/1421225449351430145"&gt;confirmed Friday&lt;/a&gt; that the redacted name in the email was Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHUS8T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-activision-blizzards-week-of-reckoning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; posted a big feature&lt;/a&gt; Friday detailing enormous challenges women have faced at Activision Blizzard. One harrowing example: men would walk into breastfeeding rooms, because at one point they didn’t have locks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="75wl28"&gt;A source who has since departed Blizzard talked about how the room designated for breastfeeding didn’t have locks. “Men would walk into the breastfeeding room. There was no way to lock the door. They would just stare and I would have to scream at them to leave.” IGN understands that breastfeeding rooms have since been updated, with locks added to doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wbg0Mw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN’s&lt;/em&gt; article also added further detail to the allegation in the DFEH’s lawsuit that working at the company was “akin to working in a frat house:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KV3h5Y"&gt;Such stories abound at Activision Blizzard, compounded by a drinking culture that until recently was “insane,” a source said. One woman told me she “doggedly avoided” drinking events on campus because of their reputation. Another talked about how it was “much more sexual” in Blizzard’s main office in Irvine circa 2015, with women being subjected to inappropriate touching in the chest area and elsewhere, “sometimes at the holiday party, sometimes not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uko3mB"&gt;Activision Blizzard has taken steps to attempt to address the problematic drinking culture by introducing a two drink maximum at company events, according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, a policy that was put in place in 2018, a company spokesperson told the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvJY8e"&gt;On Wednesday, Activision Blizzard employees walked out in protest of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;company’s handling of the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Employees had signed a letter Monday&lt;/a&gt; slamming the company’s initial response. A day later, CEO Bobby Kotick attempted to address the allegations and concerns ahead of the planned walkout, calling Activision Blizzard’s response “tone deaf” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;in a public letter&lt;/a&gt;. Just before the walkout, employees responded to Kotick’s letter in turn, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;saying that it&lt;/a&gt; “fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLJg1h"&gt;In a small positive step, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League, which is owned by Activision Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/overwatchleague/status/1421183813221109760"&gt;committed Friday to donating to “worthy causes.”&lt;/a&gt; But the league took that step after &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League teams the Washington Justice and the Houston Outlaws jointly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/washjustice/status/1420851121833320450"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Outlaws/status/1420851140422426624"&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; they would be donating to RAINN and Big Sister Little Sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Qy4ka"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/EERC7nYrvd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EERC7nYrvd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Overwatch League (@overwatchleague) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/overwatchleague/status/1421183813221109760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>After accusations, Twitter will pay hackers to find biases in its automatic image crops  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQp_ZzJR2pggc740UT7tRDi6ITA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659119/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3zSi5"&gt;Twitter is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/algorithmic-bias-bounty-challenge"&gt;holding a competition&lt;/a&gt; in hopes that hackers and researchers will be able to identify biases in its image cropping algorithm — and it’s going to be handing out cash prizes to winning teams (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bug-bounty-contest-algorithm-bias-image-cropping-185634779.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Twitter is hoping that giving teams access to its code and image cropping model will let them find ways that the algorithm could be harmful (such as it cropping in a way that stereotypes or erases the image’s subject).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXbxoN"&gt;Those competing will &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter-algorithmic-bias"&gt;have to submit a description of their findings&lt;/a&gt;, and a dataset that can be run through the algorithm to demonstrate the issue. Twitter will then assign points based on what kind of harms are found, how much it could potentially affect people, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcfeXl"&gt;The winning team will be awarded $3,500, and there are separate $1,000 prizes for the most innovative and most generalizable findings. That amount &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1421174066849931265"&gt;has caused a bit of a stir&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, with a few users saying it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m/status/1421179586813960192?s=20"&gt;should have an extra zero&lt;/a&gt;. For context, Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter?type=team"&gt;normal bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; would pay you $2,940 if you found a bug that let you perform actions for someone else (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5800370/tweetdeck-vulnerability-lets-attackers-execute-code-remotely"&gt;retweeting a tweet or image&lt;/a&gt;) using cross-site scripting. Finding an OAuth issue that lets you take over someone’s Twitter account would net you $7,700. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UX44mR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A competition lets Twitter get feedback from a much broader range of perspectives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xU7J3v"&gt;Twitter has done its own research into its image-cropping algorithm before — in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444372/twitter-image-crop-racial-gender-bias-research"&gt;it published a paper&lt;/a&gt; investigating how the algorithm was biased, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;accusations that its previews crops were racist&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;mostly done away with&lt;/a&gt; algorithmically cropping previews since then, but it’s still used on desktop and a good cropping algorithm is a handy thing for a company like Twitter to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B4n0G"&gt;Opening up a competition lets Twitter get feedback from a much broader range of perspectives. For example, the Twitter team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ruchowdh/status/1420820892398014464?s=20"&gt;held a space&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the competition during which a team member mentioned getting questions about caste-based biases in the algorithm, something that may not be noticeable to software developers in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IL8DDD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter is also looking for ways its algorithm could be exploited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SOPLMv"&gt;It’s also not just subconscious algorithmic bias Twitter is looking for. The rubric has point values for both intentional and unintentional harms. Twitter defines unintentional harms as crops that could result from a “well-intentioned” user posting a regular image on the platform, whereas intentional harms are problematic cropping behaviors that could be exploited by someone posting maliciously designed images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MZGBA"&gt;Twitter says in its announcement blog that the competition is separate from &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter?type=team"&gt;its bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; — if you submit a report about algorithmic biases to Twitter outside of the competition, the company says your report will be closed and marked as not applicable. If you’re interested in joining, you can &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter-algorithmic-bias"&gt;head over to the competition’s HackerOne page&lt;/a&gt; to see the rules, criteria, and more. Submissions are open until August 6th at 11:59PM PT, and the winners of the challenge will be announced at the Def Con AI Village on August 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastodon now has an official iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UuqtDryL8A5gdJtWPwW5ae3Yd54=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658958/mastodon.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucykbC"&gt;Decentralized social network Mastodon now has an official iPhone app. The nonprofit behind Mastodon &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974"&gt;launched the app&lt;/a&gt; on iOS today, supplementing an existing web version and several &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps"&gt;third-party apps&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, Android, and other platforms. The app is free and offers a similar feature set to Mastodon’s core service, although it doesn’t include Mastodon’s broad local and federated timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtPWX7"&gt;Mastodon describes the app as particularly geared toward getting new users on board the nontraditional social platform. As we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use"&gt;outlined before&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon looks similar to Twitter but is built around &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities"&gt;independently run communities&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="https://activitypub.rocks/"&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; protocol) rather than a single central network. You can create your account on a community of your choice while following and messaging people in other communities as well. It’s an unusual design among modern social platforms, and offering an official iOS entry point could help ease people into it more smoothly. CEO Eugen Rochko confirmed plans for a comparable Android app, but there’s no timeline for releasing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDrL1W"&gt;Mastodon’s iOS app supports features like polls and sensitive content filters, and the app page subtly highlights its differences with bigger services like Twitter by mentioning Mastodon’s “ad-free, chronological timeline.” As mentioned above, however, you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; find a section for local and federated timelines — Mastodon’s firehose of all public posts from your home community and the communities of people linked with it, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcDHdT"&gt;Rochko tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that those timelines were a “suboptimal” way to discover new content, and excluding them also reduced the potential for conflict with Apple, which has required some social networks to limit what users can find through their apps. (Reddit’s iOS app, for instance, makes you opt into NSFW content through the web.) For a different feature set, you can keep using one of the existing iOS apps — or just log in through the web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Tesla Megapack burst into flames at ‘Victorian Big Battery’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A rendering of the “Victorian Big Battery.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9ran_NXmsSFkbvZS5RfpF3IXME=/1x0:1999x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658426/VBB_Our_Battery.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rendering of what the “Victorian Big Battery” will look like when completed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Neoen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRoUZL"&gt;A Tesla Megapack &lt;a href="https://victorianbigbattery.com.au/incident-at-vbb/"&gt;caught fire&lt;/a&gt; today during initial testing of a highly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551342/australia-power-grid-victorian-big-battery"&gt;anticipated new utility-scale battery&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria, Australia. Luckily, there were no injuries or disruptions to the local electricity supply, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/07/30/tesla-megapack-caught-fire-at-victorian-big-battery-site-in-australia.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; reports. The blaze posed no risk of spreading to the nearby community, according to &lt;a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/fire-erupts-at-tesla-big-battery-in-australia-during-testing?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it did trigger a toxic smoke warning for residents who were told to stay indoors, the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/fire-breaks-out-during-testing-of-victorian-big-battery-near-geelong-20210730-p58eh4.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The cause of the fire is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KZTrBh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;JUST IN: Fire crews are currently on the scene of a battery fire at Moorabool, near Geelong. Firefighters are working to contain the fire and stop it spreading to the nearby batteries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3"&gt;https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/7NEWS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#7NEWS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HAkFY27JgQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HAkFY27JgQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 7NEWS Melbourne (@7NewsMelbourne) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/7NewsMelbourne/status/1420932114296446987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jczpWD"&gt;The fire affected the aptly named “Victorian Big Battery.” Spanning an area nearly as big as a football stadium, it’s one of the largest in the world. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.neoen.com/var/fichiers/2021-02-25-media-release-vbb-fc.pdf"&gt;scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to be operational by the end of this year, and the 300MW battery should be able to store enough energy to power more than a million homes in Victoria for half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Up7O"&gt;That’s supposed to help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-26/victorian-blackouts-what-caused-them-and-is-this-the-new-normal/10751412"&gt;blackouts&lt;/a&gt; that have affected hundreds of thousands of homes in the region in recent years, especially in the summer when demand for electricity spikes. Giant batteries are also crucial to meeting environmental and renewable energy goals. The state of Victoria aims to get half of its electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar power by 2030. Batteries can fill in the gaps in energy supply when the sun doesn’t shine and winds don’t blow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbcP7l"&gt;French renewable energy company Neoen is developing the Victorian Big Battery alongside Tesla and energy company AusNet Services. Neoen and Tesla brought another grid-scale battery online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/1/16723186/elon-musk-battery-launched-south-australia"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which was the largest lithium-ion battery in the world at the time.  Neoen did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYy7vf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: this quarter’s earnings for Apple, Samsung, Google, and Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TLA4kbFVe5yIvwBFZjqDivBJqpw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658113/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNu3A0"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eR9GXx"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay and Dieter bring back &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;managing editor Alex Cranz and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg to chat about the headlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAzEz0"&gt;It’s earnings week once again. Unsurprisingly, all of the big tech companies made a lot of money this past quarter. Our podcast crew dives into the numbers behind the profits of Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon, and Apple and what it means for each business’s future goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq9qnE"&gt;The show also dedicates some time to discuss Intel’s business. Chaim leads the discussion after writing a story about Intel’s worst summer last year and how it’s been fighting its way back since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F4Yqag"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/5Bzh5aHP2F3wip4KzwpAHO" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5i9dTN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DRLPg"&gt;You can listen to the full discussion here or in your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;
