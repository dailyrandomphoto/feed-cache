    <title>How Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine could narrow equity gaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="isLuDX"&gt;All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States will help save lives and reduce hospitalizations. But the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22301558/covid-vaccine-one-dose-johnson-fda-approval"&gt;newly authorized&lt;/a&gt; Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot has some key advantages that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/04-COVID-Oliver.pdf"&gt;experts say&lt;/a&gt; could help make the vaccination campaign more equitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgYPNB"&gt;Unlike the first two vaccines, produced by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine can be stored in the refrigerator and only takes one shot to protect people from COVID-19. It could be sent to community clinics, which are equipped to reach people in rural areas or who don’t have regular contact with the health system. Because it only takes one dose, it could help vaccinate people who might be difficult to reach twice, like people experiencing homelessness. Officials could also easily bring it to people in jails and prisons. All of those groups are also at high risk of catching and becoming seriously ill with COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeTGHT"&gt;“This vaccine could make it easier to reach some disproportionately affected groups,” said Sarah Oliver, an epidemic intelligence service officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at a vaccine advisory committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/04-COVID-Oliver.pdf"&gt;meeting this weekend&lt;/a&gt;. The committee’s COVID-19 vaccine working group felt that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will improve vaccine equity in the US. So far,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Black and Hispanic people in many states have been vaccinated at low rates, and communities hit hardest by the pandemic have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287123/covid-vaccination-death-inequity-race-maps"&gt;slowest to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmhCuM"&gt;Mass vaccination sites have the facilities and personnel to handle the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines, which have to be stored in freezers and require two doses.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;These massive sites are able to get thousands of doses in arms each day but can be inaccessible to people who don’t have a car or easy form of transportation. The site &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/health/covid-vaccine-sites.html"&gt;in East Hartford, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, for example, isn’t accessible by city bus. So far, 82 percent of the people getting vaccinated there are white. Only around &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hartfordcityconnecticut/PST045219"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people who live in East Hartford and Hartford are white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HX00ar"&gt;Those sites also aren’t designed to reach or connect with people who may be reluctant to get vaccinated. “They’re not there to counsel you,” said Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/health/covid-vaccine-sites.html"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “You go to get the shot, end of story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmEWT7"&gt;Some states are already planning to use some of their doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to reach groups that are harder to vaccinate. Washington state &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1366349330081345541"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it might use it to vaccinate people working in the fishing industry, who live in shared housing on ships. New York City plans to use it to vaccinate homebound seniors. “We’ll have nurses and other medical professionals go apartment by apartment to those who cannot even leave their apartment and make sure they are safe,” Mayor Bill de Blasio &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/106-21/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-plan-vaccinate-homebound-seniors"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a press conference this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEoDGp"&gt;Doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will be limited to start. Just under &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/28/world/covid-19-coronavirus#cdc-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine"&gt;4 million doses&lt;/a&gt; are being sent to states this week, and none will be sent next week. The company says they will have a total of 20 million doses available by the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discovery Plus is the perfect background noise streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5RFL2KkCIXGvR2SidySE99sJ0M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891662/house_hunters.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="udlLX8"&gt;The word discovery implies there’s something new to find, but I’ve spent the past few weeks steadily making my way through a show that’s been on the air for more than 20 years, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22018581/discovery-streaming-service-launch-date-price-shark-week-hgtv-food-network"&gt;Discovery Plus&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqrP5H"&gt;Thanks to &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;(and &lt;em&gt;House Hunters International, &lt;/em&gt;alongside &lt;em&gt;Tiny House Hunters&lt;/em&gt;) my days spent inside, working from home and doing nothing but watching TV, have transitioned almost exclusively to Discovery Plus. It exists as white noise in my apartment: the buzzing of couples arguing over whether to pay the full $560,000 for a house in the nice neighborhood closer to the cute bistro or take a chance on the $480,000 home that needs some work but is way under budget emitting from my TV set. From the time I start working until the second I’m beginning to wind down, &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;plays continuously on its dedicated channel housed within Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sifGJC"&gt;“Our bet is when the world makes a full rotation, that the content people have chosen when they could choose anything on TV or cable, the content that they love and run home for — &lt;em&gt;90 Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Property Brothers&lt;/em&gt; — they’re still going to love that,” Discovery CEO David Zaslav &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/business/media/cable-tv-streaming-discovery.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a recent interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr7Hga"&gt;Discovery Plus, home to shows from networks like HGTV, TLC, Investigation Discovery, and the Food Network, launched at just the right moment, when ambient television was becoming a fixture in people’s homes during the pandemic. Author and journalist Kyle Chayka referred &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcultural-comment%2Femily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F1%2F22307034%2Fdiscovery-plus-ambient-tv-hgtv-food-tlc-house-hunters-90-day-fiance-diners-driveins-dives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to ambient TV as something&lt;/a&gt; “you don’t have to pay attention to in order to enjoy but which is still seductive enough to be compelling if you choose to do so momentarily.” For Chayka, that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498727/emily-in-paris-review-darren-star-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This reasoning is also what makes &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt;, as well as 90 percent of the series on Discovery Plus, perfect ambient television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QLLGLK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Streaming also makes ambient TV possible in a way cable television can’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9w47rN"&gt;Streaming also makes ambient TV possible in a way cable television can’t because there’s a total ad-free option. Loud commercials that play every seven minutes cease to exist. Functionally, I have the option to throw on a &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;channel that streams episodes of the show 24/7 and forget about it. Streaming services are designed to make viewing as effortless as possible and keep people’s attention once they’ve started watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce3xKH"&gt;So far, it’s working out better than expected for Discovery Plus. The company has signed up &lt;a href="https://corporate.discovery.com/discovery-newsroom/discovery-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results/"&gt;more than 11 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to the platform since it launched in early January. Discovery’s target audience is people between 25 and 54, a wide bracket but one with the most disposable income as of 2019, &lt;a href="http://statista.com/statistics/980324/us-mean-disposable-household-income-age/"&gt;according to Statista&lt;/a&gt;. The disposable income of a household led by a person between the ages of 25 and 54 ranged between $69,700 and $91,400 in 2019, Statista reported. Add in that cord-cutting continues to happen at an accelerated rate and that millennials are one of the biggest groups to sign up for three or more streaming services, and Discovery Plus’ potential is obvious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlXF5m"&gt;Zaslav chalked up the impressive initial signups as proof that “people really don’t change that much,” when talking to the &lt;em&gt;Times. &lt;/em&gt;That’s probably true, but having an ad-free option that does for adults and college students what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169873/disney-plus-streaming-marvel-star-wars-new-shows-movies-star-hulu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frozen 2 &lt;/em&gt;on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cocomelon &lt;/em&gt;on YouTube and Netflix&lt;/a&gt; repeats do for kids has become essential in my home. To quote a popular TikTok meme, &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;on Discovery Plus leads to “empty head, no thoughts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Fsbsr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To quote a popular TikTok meme, ‘&lt;em&gt;House Hunters’ &lt;/em&gt;on Discovery Plus leads to “empty head, no thoughts”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajR4Lj"&gt;There’s another term for this: waiting room television. Like daytime TV talk shows or new soap opera episodes, shows like &lt;em&gt;90 Day Fiancé, House Hunters, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives &lt;/em&gt;are just interesting enough to catch someone’s fleeting attention, but they’re monotonous enough to not become total distractions. They simply exist to keep people entertained if they want but can float into the background if someone would rather check in on Instagram or read a book instead — or, in my case, work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="731LKZ"&gt;Discovery Plus still has a long way to go. There are basic product features that need to be fixed (finding on-demand videos instead of 24/7 channels is more difficult than it should be), and I haven’t seen any new series or specials that have caught my attention. Discovery also has to ensure that it’s keeping the vast majority of those who do sign up. For now, Discovery filled a need I didn’t know I had while working at home — pure, ongoing, ambient TV that I don’t have to think about for hours the second I hit play. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Workspace picks up new features designed for remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Second screen in Google Meet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chasco0-Ge9AbcxbJosfcIjlnpU=/397x0:4672x2850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891527/Companion_UI_SeriesOne_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second screen in Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ctw7Nd"&gt;Google is adding a &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/the-future-of-work-with-google-workspace"&gt;smattering of new features to Google Workspace today&lt;/a&gt;, including new tools for categorizing your focus time in Google Calendar and Chat, better ways to join Google Meet videoconferences with multiple devices, and a version of its office suite for frontline workers. It’s also taking Google Assistant for Workspace out of beta and making it generally available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nt9Ex4"&gt;The company is trying to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/the-future-of-work-with-google-workspace"&gt;categorize these features&lt;/a&gt; as part of a new push for what it calls “collaboration equity.” For Google, it’s a high-minded way of explaining the tools it’s trying to create so people working from home are not put at a disadvantage compared to people working from an office (when people are allowed back into offices, that is). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eu5j8E"&gt;The idea that comes closest to hitting that mark is Google’s tools for setting your status across its suite of products. In addition to setting up out-of-office and working hours, users will also be able to create a new event type called Focus Time. When you set up a block of Focus Time, Google says it will limit “notifications during these event windows.” You can also set your location, letting co-workers get a better sense of your availability and time zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnW9KO"&gt;The key is that Workspace’s various tools like Gmail and Chat will be aware of your current status and location and adjust your notifications to suit. It’s not nearly the ideal universal status indicator, but it’s a step in the right direction — as long as you live mostly in Google Workspace and aren’t mixing in other tools like Slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXoPI4"&gt;The new types of statuses on the calendar also allow Google to make a kind of work-focused “time well spent” chart, only this one shows how much time you’re wasting in meetings every week. Google says this “Time Insights” breakdown will only be available to workers, not their bosses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Calendar Time Insights" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDs2Mj1zBZEwQ9TjgIyG86LUZfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336618/time_insights.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Calendar Time Insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PhMpeT"&gt;Google is also introducing “second-screen experiences” for Google Meet. It essentially allows people to log in to a meeting from multiple devices, making it easier to share screens (or get other work done) without the meeting taking up your whole laptop. The idea is that home workers could use a Google Nest Hub Max or their phone to log in to the meeting but still be able to present from their main computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ML6INC"&gt;On phones, Google Meet is picking up a mobile tile view for video calls, picture-in-picture support, and split screen. It’s not clear whether those tools will work across both Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgasUZ"&gt;Google is also building up its lower-cost &lt;a href="https://workspace.google.com/essentials/"&gt;Google Workspace Essentials offering&lt;/a&gt; with support for Chat, Jamboard, and Calendar — all of which were weird omissions at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSjyWu"&gt;Finally, Google says it’s launching “Google Workspace Frontline,” which it calls a “custom solution” for frontline workers. It seems to be a simplified way for administrators to configure a Google Workspace setup for workers in retail or in the field. It will also make it possible to create &lt;a href="https://www.appsheet.com/"&gt;AppSheet apps&lt;/a&gt; (simple, form-based apps) within Google Sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq7JYZ"&gt;Put together, the set of feature updates Google is announcing today seem mostly designed to make meetings either less painful (because you can more easily multitask during them) or easier to avoid (because you can set up Focus Time and also discover how much time you’ve given away in the Time Insights sidebar). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket Lab unveils bigger rocket and plans to go public via SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World’s First Battery-Powered Rocket Engine To Make Space More Accessible" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YUZ5rf2VZSOrLaicOqokZtxlmTw=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891501/476478078.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter Beck’s Rocket Lab is going public.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Phil Walter / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ijiBv"&gt;Small launch firm Rocket Lab announced plans on Monday to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, marking the latest deal in an industry where SPAC mergers are becoming increasingly common. The firm also unveiled a new rocket called Neutron that its chief executive said will be capable of launching humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWu6h2"&gt;The SPAC deal values Long Beach, California-based Rocket Lab at $4.1 billion and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. Once the merger is done, Vector Acquisition Corporation, the SPAC Rocket Lab is merging with, will change its name to Rocket Lab USA, Inc, and the Nasdaq ticker symbol will be RKLB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ismgDM"&gt;“This milestone accelerates Rocket Lab’s ability to unlock the full potential of space through our launch and spacecraft platforms and catalyzes our ambition to create a new multi-billion-dollar business vertical in space applications,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0OzoO"&gt;Rocket Lab will have $750 million in cash when the deal closes, fueling development of the company’s next rocket dubbed Neutron, a fully reusable launch vehicle capable of lifting eight tons to orbit. The rocket is “tailored for mega constellations, deep space missions and human spaceflight,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ9Taa"&gt;Rocket Lab’s workhorse Electron rocket has launched 18 missions since its first flight in 2017 from the company’s main launch site in New Zealand. That rocket is in the early stages of transforming into a reusable vehicle. After a launch, its main booster stage will eventually be plucked out of midair by a helicopter instead of crashing into the ocean, like it does now in its test phase. The company plans to test that helicopter maneuver later this year, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578725/rocket-lab-electron-launch-recovery-reusability-parachute-dress-rehearsal"&gt;a successful splashdown recovery test&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WcSXGeyCH-0wgbNXT4-L-eodpbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336608/electron_recovery.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rocket Lab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron first stage floats under a parachute for a return splashdown test after launching satellites to space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FpwgRQ"&gt;Plans for Rocket Lab’s next rocket, Neutron, were revealed on Monday. With a debut flight slated for 2024, Neutron will stand just over 130 feet tall and be a “direct alternative to” SpaceX’s bigger Falcon 9 rocket, an &lt;a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Project-Prestige-Investor-Presentation.pdf"&gt;investor presentation&lt;/a&gt; said. It’ll be capable of launching humans and sending astronauts to the International Space Station, a task traditionally handled by governments but that is shifting more to private companies. SpaceX and Boeing are NASA’s current contractors for sending astronauts to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jxmBI"&gt;In the past, Beck has said Rocket Lab would never reuse a rocket or build one bigger than Electron, and he vowed to “eat his hat” if he ever recants. He didn’t eat a hat when his company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757441/rocket-lab-electron-reusable-helicopter-recovery-spacex"&gt;announced plans to reuse Electron&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, but now with the release of Neutron, he actually blended a Rocket Lab baseball cap in a blender and ate it on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x43Hcp"&gt;“There’s a lot of things at Rocket Lab that we said we were gonna do, that we’ve done,” Beck said in a video his company tweeted on Monday. “And a few things at Rocket Lab that we said we’d never do, which we have also done. So I think with this project, it’s about time I finally ate the hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nK32Pk"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NbLgCY"&gt;Currently, Rocket Lab, founded in 2006, is the industry leader for dedicated missions launching small satellites. Dozens of other small launch firms have been established since, jockeying for a slice of the market. But potential shortfalls in traditional funding and fears that demand for small launchers is overblown — or that there’s just too many launch companies now — have driven a recent wave of consolidations and SPAC mergers in the space industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiSiI0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPACs&lt;/a&gt;, or “blank check” companies, are traded publicly to raise money before merging with a privately held company, presenting a quicker route for a private company to go public besides the more traditional initial public offering process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slh7a1"&gt;Last month, small launch firm Astra announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262004/astra-rocket-launch-startup-spac"&gt;plans to go public via SPAC&lt;/a&gt; at a $2.1 billion valuation, citing 50 customer launches lined up and over $150 million of contracted launch revenue so far. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;became the first space tourism company to go public&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 through a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia, a SPAC. In-space transportation firm Momentus Space &lt;a href="https://momentus.space/investors/"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; last year to go public after merging with Stable Road Acquisition Corp. And just a few months ago, space-based broadband startup AST &amp;amp; Science &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/ast-science-to-go-public-via-special-purpose-acquisition/"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; it’s doing a SPAC merger to go public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gxzt0"&gt;On Monday, the same day as Rocket Lab’s announcement, Spire Global, a space-based satellite data company with over 100 satellites in space, announced its own plans to go public through NavSight Holdings, Inc., another SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot is bringing in-person League of Legends and Valorant tournaments to Iceland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1_y_r2DHjYeaNOzKj-ejBwc79k=/0x0:2047x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891410/50502367016_9c078c5fc8_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Riot Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XBdaVz"&gt;Riot Games plans to host two big esports tournaments in Reykjavik, Iceland, the studio announced on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvV6Gw"&gt;The first will be &lt;em&gt;League of Legends’ &lt;/em&gt;Mid-Season Invitational (MSI), which was canceled last year due to COVID-19. MSI is one of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends’&lt;/em&gt; marquee tournaments, pitting top teams around the world against each other. The event will begin on May 6th and end on May 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKqkjA"&gt;One day later, on May 24th, Riot will kick off &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Champions Tour (VCT) Masters Reykjavik, which the studio says is the first live international tournament for the game. Ten teams will compete to earn points toward qualification for &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Champions 2021, the global tournament that concludes the &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; esports season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qI8Emz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n3pwNMGKX0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3XFpjL"&gt;Like many other esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with teams competing virtually at times for safety. Not all competition has been online, though: Riot hosted last year’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship in person in Shanghai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21351494/league-of-legends-world-championship-shanghai-september-riot-coronavirus"&gt;with strict safety protocols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaYtO4"&gt;For both upcoming events in Iceland, teams will be required to quarantine when they arrive, and there won’t be an in-person audience, according to Riot. All MSI matches and VCT Masters Stage 2 matches will be broadcast online, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7srtB"&gt;Both events will be held in the Laugardalshöll indoor sporting arena.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s new Live Rooms feature lets up to four people go live at once</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IrV5a3C2-YAnpwW49Za4h9_Uulk=/125x0:1745x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891418/Live1Long.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zyfVQu"&gt;Instagram wants more people to go live at once, so today, it’s launching Live Rooms. The feature, which will be available globally, allows four people to video chat in a live broadcast, compared to the previous limit of two. Instagram’s blog post today says it hopes the feature encourages people to start a “talk show or a podcast,” host a “jam session,” or collaborate with other creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8NOHD"&gt;Going live with more people means the rooms could attract larger audiences. The followers of everyone participating will see the live room and, depending on their notifications, be pinged about it. (Anyone blocked by the active participants won’t be able to join the live, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoZ2Gw"&gt;The easy comparison to make here is to Clubhouse, the buzzy social audio app that lets people go live in rooms. More than 10 people can speak at once, and rooms can reach up to 8,000 people before they’re full. Facebook is reportedly building a direct competitor, but Instagram Live could capture some people who might be interested in Clubhouse but can’t access it currently — it’s invite-only and only available through iOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gVt8G"&gt;But unlike Clubhouse, Instagram Live requires people to be on-camera, which comes with the added pressure of looking good and being in a photogenic environment. Clubhouse is thriving because it only requires a phone and lowers the audio expectation. (People regularly chat when they’re in the car, out on a walk, or just in a loud place.) Still, Live Rooms will likely do well on the platform as people fall back on their already-established followers and bank on the high energy more people in a room can create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wz6ja4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen ID 4 review: electric chill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UiHo3B2aGdGAhG1z585Tkz9Cg2Q=/0x348:8256x5852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891239/B2247068.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want an electric car with decent range, low-key technology, and not much else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iUCfuM"&gt;Once upon a time, affordable electric compact SUVs were very hard to come by. There were plenty of cheap electric hatchbacks and a whole mess of luxury sedans and SUVs, but you’d have to cough up $50,000 or more if you wanted one. Then came the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/3/15/18266881/tesla-model-y-suv-interior-controls-first-drive-2019"&gt;Tesla Model Y&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;the Ford Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;, and now our cup runneth over with reasonably priced battery-powered crossovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5GUvK"&gt;The latest to emerge is the Volkswagen ID 4, an absolutely delightful compact electric SUV with a decent amount of range, some quirky designs, and a whole lot of potential. It’s also a milestone for the automaker as its first long-range electric vehicle available in North America, the first electric SUV, and the second EV powered by its MEB modular electric architecture. But more than that, the ID 4 is a relatively affordable EV with a lot of the SUV DNA that car buyers in the US really crave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L4VnL9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An affordable EV with a lot of the SUV DNA that car buyers really crave&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1HugD"&gt;This was my second time driving the ID 4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502032/volkswagen-id4-electric-suv-first-drive-vw"&gt;The first time&lt;/a&gt;, I only had it for a couple of hours; this time, VW lent it to me for two days, and I drove it all over North New Jersey — on highways, residential streets, and even some rural roads. During that time, I got a lot of admiring stares from an interesting cross-section of passersby. Even the toll booth operator on the Garden State Parkway let out a whistle of approval after I handed him my $1.90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZek1l"&gt;“That looks sweeter than a Tesla,” he said with a raised eyebrow. This from a guy who literally watches thousands of cars pass by every day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VmsAug0ufbEHtfTwqusaSzc4f4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331911/B2247068.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="70jWvW"&gt;LET’S SEE SOME ID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NtQ7Rx"&gt;Last year, when Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21444141/volkswagen-vw-id4-electric-suv-price-range-specs"&gt;unveiled the ID 4 for the first time&lt;/a&gt; at an eerily empty, socially distanced event in Brooklyn, the company’s CEO for North America, Scott Keogh, warned me not to make the obvious comparisons to other EVs, like Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rO1TXK"&gt;That’s because VW views its &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;competition as all of the popular gas-powered compact SUVs, like the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, and Toyota Rav4. The company has its eyes on a higher prize: not just the most popular electric vehicle in its segment, but the most popular vehicle on the road, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGy5Nl"&gt;It’s too early to tell whether the ID 4 will live up to those lofty expectations, but I can report that it is simply a great car. It has plenty of range for daily driving and short trips (but probably not anything longer than that), the technology inside feels intuitive without being in your face, and the really surprising thing is the whimsicality of the ID 4 — like VW wants you to just have fun while driving it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u7WMgo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Of course, the ID 4’s origins aren’t so playful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJgaAB"&gt;Of course, the ID 4’s origins aren’t so playful. The car wouldn’t be here today without &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/23/9384791/volkswagens-huge-diesel-emissions-scandal-the-full-story"&gt;Dieselgate, the massive emissions cheating scandal&lt;/a&gt; that nearly crippled VW five years ago. As part of its many settlements, VW agreed to dedicate billions of dollars toward electric vehicles. That’s we’re getting the ID 4 in the year 2021 and not two or three years from now when the EV market is a bit more mature. Consider it an apology for all that extra pollution created by its millions of diesel vehicles (11 million to be precise). And as far as apologies go, the ID 4 is a pretty great start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebW12b"&gt;So let’s talk about the car itself. There are three different trim levels: the Pro, the Pro S, and the First Edition, which is the one we have and obviously the first one available for sale. The First Edition ID 4 only comes with rear-wheel drive, while both the Pro and Pro S will have rear-wheel &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;all-wheel drive options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NALyoW"&gt;You can choose from six exterior colors: “glacier white,” “mythos black,” “moonstone grey,” “scale silver,” “blue dusk,” and “king’s red.” I got the blue color, which I really like; it pops without being too ostentatious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgIbg2"&gt;The cheapest model, the Pro with rear-wheel drive, will retail for $39,995, while the most expensive trim, the all-wheel drive Pro S, will sell for $48,175. But when you factor in the $7,500 federal tax credit, plus any state and local incentives, the base model ID 4 lands in that low- to mid-$30,000 range that’s generally considered the sweet spot for most car buyers. That’ll still be prohibitively expensive for a lot of people, especially when you consider those gas-powered variants like the Rav4 often go for less than $25,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsqlLm"&gt;The First Edition ID 4 is expected to get 250 miles of range on a single charge — but that hasn’t been certified yet by regulators. It’s possible that the Environmental Protection Agency will rate the ID 4 with less than 250 miles of range, which could drive away those customers who have dreams of road-tripping across the country in their electric vehicle. Either way, it’s not as much as the Tesla Model 3 or Model Y, but I think it will suit a lot of people’s needs. (&lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35633671/2021-volkswagen-id4-range-tested/"&gt;A recent highway range test by &lt;em&gt;Car &amp;amp; Driver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;only got 190 miles. Big yikes!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-7MjH1-QZ4SDwcTk1Oh-e0isMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331954/B2247045.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HFSBt7"&gt;VW says “every effort” has been made to optimize aerodynamics as a way to improve the vehicle’s range. You can see that with the swooping lines in the body of the vehicle, the large roof spoiler, and the door handles that are flush against the side. Again, not exactly revelatory (a lot of EVs have similar features), but it does show that VW is thinking seriously about ways it can improve the vehicle’s daily performance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YoSuH"&gt;The ID 4 has an 82 kilowatt-hour battery pack, 77 kWh of which are usable. It’s located in the floor of the vehicle, helping create a low center of gravity. The electric motor is located in the rear of the vehicle, which is similar to the original Volkswagen Beetle. You can feel that when you’re on a winding road, and the ID 4 is really hugging the curves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxr7j1"&gt;Initially, the ID 4’s battery pack, which is comprised of 288 pouch cells in 12 modules, will be produced by South Korea’s LG Chem. But once ID 4 production shifts to Chattanooga, Tennessee, the batteries will be &lt;a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/breakingnews/story/2020/jun/26/sk-innovation-plans-940-million-expansion-georgia/526225/"&gt;supplied by SK Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, another South Korean company that recently opened a $2 billion factory nearby VW’s plant there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bQg0yB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can feel that when you’re on a winding road, and the ID 4 is really hugging the curves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahbfyx"&gt;There are four driving modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport, and a custom setting that allows drivers to pick and choose from the other modes to best suit their own style. Just like I live my life, I did most of my driving in Comfort. It’s got pretty good oomph for an EV, with 201 horsepower and 228 pound-feet of torque. It can sprint from 0 to 60 in a little over 7 seconds — that’s what VW claims; I didn’t test it myself. That’s nowhere near as fast as Tesla’s performance models, but it makes sense when you consider the curb weight is over two tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1NZ8p"&gt;While driving, if you expected a low-grade motor whir common with EVs, and you’d be right. No noisy combustion under the hood means no noise radiating throughout the vehicle’s interior. As you accelerate, the motor definitely emits a higher-pitch sound, but it’s not distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEoHLl"&gt;There is a fake sound that the vehicle makes at low speeds, as required by law to alert pedestrians and cyclists. It reminded me of that episode of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons &lt;/em&gt;where &lt;a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Leader#:~:text=Biography,come%20to%20an%20introductory%20session."&gt;the cult leader who promised alien salvation&lt;/a&gt; to the people of Springfield is revealed to be a guy with a kazoo on a pedal-powered aircraft. Don’t ask me why my brain works this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kuEfB"&gt;Thanks to a narrow A-pillar and a stubby front end, I felt like I could see everything I was supposed to from the driver’s seat. So many SUVs on the market today have gargantuan front ends, creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;dangerous front blind spots&lt;/a&gt; for drivers that could be fatal, especially for children. Compact SUVs don’t typically have this problem, but it felt like VW made the necessary design choices to ensure maximum visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Q_N05LKM14sJ0TP5VbfHAR4BLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331952/B2247050.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hhTim0"&gt;EVS, BUT MAKE IT FASHION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rDDPag"&gt;One of my favorite parts of the ID 4 is the front and rear lights. Normally, I’m not into illuminated vehicle badges, but there’s something appealing about the light bar stretching across the full width of the vehicle. It’s the ID 4’s way of saying, “Hey, I’m an electric car” without exactly clubbing you over the head with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5cvwC"&gt;There are actually a lot of cool lighting accents all over this vehicle. At nighttime, a hexagonal light emanates from both the driver and passenger doors and projects on the ground. Inside the vehicle, a light bar runs along the base of the windshield that serves as a communication device. If you’re using the navigation, and you’re about to turn right, a blue light will move left to right across the width of the windshield to signal that you’re about to make a turn. It also serves as a status bar when you’re charging the vehicle. I thought it seemed gimmicky at first, but seeing it in action, I found it to be a pretty helpful effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i8qTab"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can choose from 30 different colors, so if you’re feeling kind of pink, go pink&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CPbpF"&gt;And the lights are all adjustable. You can choose from 30 different colors, so if you’re feeling kind of pink, go pink. Having more of a blue day? Go for it. Are the adjustable colors necessary at all? No. Are they really fun to play around with? Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRyfJl"&gt;More evidence of VW’s quirky designs are the “play” and “pause” pedals. I remember seeing these a few years ago in VW’s ID Buzz electric microbus concept and thinking they seemed really stupid. But now I think I kind of get it. You can’t call it a gas pedal when the car runs on electrons, right? So why not play and pause? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9KoIt5rBOBfIVjItd5gp2mFZ-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331956/B2247047.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dpC6GK"&gt;There are two screens, a 5.3-inch instrument cluster behind the steering wheel and a 12-inch one in the center console. It’s nice to see a pair of screens that don’t completely dominate the interior. The UX is totally fine, but for those who prefer their smartphone’s interface, the ID 4 supports both wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The screens looked great; they were bright and vibrant, and the colors really popped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOowKh"&gt;I didn’t experience an excessive amount of lagginess with the center screen, but there were a few sticky spots, especially while swiping from menu to menu. Those expecting Tesla-level responsiveness will be disappointed. The ID 4 will get over-the-air software updates, so it’s nothing that VW can’t fix in the future. We can only hope that VW has cleared up its software quality-control issues that effectively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess"&gt;delayed the delivery of the ID 3 hatchback&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oSNicM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were a few sticky spots, especially while swiping from menu to menu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvuQzR"&gt;There’s a home button on the left side of the screen for easy access, and the default software felt similar enough to CarPlay that I was fine using either. The screen is also slightly angled toward the driver, which was a nice touch. That said, the ID 4’s default navigation isn’t as clean-looking as Google Maps, as is usually the case with most cars today. There aren’t many physical buttons, but the ones they have had nice haptic feedback to them that felt satisfying to the touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlPVho"&gt;The voice assistant, which is activated by saying “Hello, ID,” was much improved from the last time I drove the ID 4. It was effective at controlling the HVAC system and making other small changes, though I still found I had to repeat myself a lot. The lag time between using the wake words and issuing a command is also still too long, but I can see VW easily improving that in future iterations. Still, it isn’t as advanced as the new Volvos with native Android Auto. But I also don’t expect the German auto giant to be able to match Google’s history of developing artificial intelligence in just a couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVBiId"&gt;There’s also gesture control which allows you to move between menus just by swiping your hand in front of the screen. The less said about this wonky feature, the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBgOFH"&gt;I found the driver’s seat to be very comfortable and the headroom to be expansive. The panoramic sunroof was similar to what’s found in most Teslas these days and was really a joy to sit under. The white leather in the First Edition was a nice touch, and the air vents are real air vents, with open and close knobs, so this might be the car for you if you find Tesla’s digital air vents off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hOmX33"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The less said about this wonky feature, the better&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lhiOyZ"&gt;Tapping through the settings gets you to the camera feature, where you can see a simulated 360-degree image of the car from the top down but not an actual camera image of the car from that angle. You also get the view from the rear-mounted camera, which is expansive. VW uses a good amount of the screen to show you these images, which really helps when reversing or navigating tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R340xV"&gt;The ID 4 uses a front radar, front camera, two rear radars, and eight ultrasound sensors to see the world around it. The driver-assist system isn’t advanced like Tesla’s Autopilot or GM’s Super Cruise, but it does have the standard features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot detection, and pedestrian monitoring. Like most driver-assist systems, the controls aren’t very intuitive, and drivers are recommended to brush up on which buttons do what before attempting to activate it on a busy highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xenG9N"&gt;There’s no driver monitoring system, which is a bummer, but the ID 4 did show me a pop-up message on the instrument cluster reminding me to keep my hands on the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gsgijDd9Tlf9RyvE-fIi8vhI34s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331995/B2247053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JZCWTW"&gt;CHARGE!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qwMCOj"&gt;The ID 4 comes with an 11 kW onboard charger that allows the ID 4 to charge to full in seven and a half hours at a home or public Level 2 charger. As with most EVs, it’s not recommended to charge the ID 4 on a normal 120-volt outlet because the rate of charging is practically glacial. There’s really no point to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4hot7"&gt;At a DC fast-charging station, with 125 kW charging, the ID 4 can go from 5 to 80 percent charged in about 38 minutes. The challenge, of course, is finding a charger that can actually provide that much power; a lot of public chargers only supply about half as many kilowatts, which will obviously make recharging the ID 4’s battery take longer than predicted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8P4OM"&gt;One of the big selling points for the ID 4 is three years of free charging with VW’s Electrify America charging network. Like Tesla, VW has skin in the game when it comes to EV charging infrastructure, which will go a long way in luring shoppers away from the warm embrace of combustion engine familiarity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4SaOu6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three years of free charging with VW’s Electrify America&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pftY4K"&gt;Electrify America has approximately 500 charging stations in the US, with over 2,200 DC fast chargers — though the company expects to install or have under development approximately 800 stations with about 3,500 DC fast chargers by December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzaHTG"&gt;A fast, reliable network of charging stations will go a long way in selling the ID 4 to customers. The $40,000 price tag will help, too. But it’s still going to be tough for VW to siphon buyers away from low-priced alternatives like the Honda CR-V or Toyota Rav4, both of which are in the mid-$20,000 range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SGro3L"&gt;IS THE ID 4 YOU?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cvuHGL"&gt;Volkswagen is currently the second-largest automaker in the world, having just lost the top spot to Toyota. Its first long-range, mass-market EV in the US is something to take seriously. That said, the ID 4 is not for everyone. For some, it will be too expensive. For others, it will lack the devil-may-care attitude of a Tesla or the warm fuzziness of a familiar nameplate like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;the Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhmF09"&gt;For me, it felt right. It handled great, the tech was both low-key and competent, and the joy that went into the design of the ID 4 was very tangible and effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ozqS9"&gt;The ID 3 and 4 are just the first offerings of VW’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/vw-boosts-new-technology-spending-to-66-billion-through-2024?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;$66 billion electrification push&lt;/a&gt;. Forthcoming vehicles will be based on concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;), a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;), and a revamped version of its iconic microbus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;ID Buzz&lt;/a&gt;), for which VW has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;promised a delivery variant&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a coupe version of the ID 4, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291294/vw-id5-ev-electric-suv-coupe-production-volkswagen-2021"&gt;aptly named the ID 5&lt;/a&gt;. All are being built on Volkswagen’s MEB modular electric vehicle platform, which will also underpin a commercial electric vehicle from Ford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo5mmt"&gt;The ID family of vehicles won’t be VW’s first foray into battery-powered drivetrains. VW subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848460/porsche-taycan-electric-sports-car-turbo-price-specs-mile-range-reveal"&gt;Porsche recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; its first all-electric sports car, the Taycan. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;The E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, the first battery-electric SUV from Volkswagen Group-owned Audi, debuted in 2018. Together, these vehicles represent the tip of the spear in VW’s effort to dominate the emerging EV market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipYYGi"&gt;They’re also crucial in helping VW turn the page on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;Dieselgate&lt;/a&gt;, in which VW was accused of installing illegal software in 11 million diesel cars that would help them pass government emissions tests conducted in a lab, then allow the vehicles to produce higher emissions outside of the lab. The company thought it could get away with the deception, but it got caught. Tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements later, VW has a unique opportunity to start to make real amends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BbLrDN"&gt;Volkswagen is calling the ID 4 the “most important vehicle ... since the launch of the Beetle,” and it’s apparent that the company put a lot of effort into making that true. It has a legacy in the US that it wants to maintain and a lot of baggage to overcome. Fortunately, the ID 4 is a really strong contender in a year that is going to be overloaded with electric crossovers. But if the price is any indicator, it’s going to be an uphill battle for VW’s battery-powered crossover to cross over into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZf5eJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdzZq7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gab blames reported hack of 40 million posts on ‘demon hackers’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gab" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFuFQjkW8bu61aE6gx53Yec6csA=/0x0:768x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891218/desktop_gabfidddx.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMBXOl"&gt;Right-wing social media website Gab has reportedly been hacked, and CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1366123617847828483?s=20"&gt;Andrew Torba said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that “demon hackers” were to blame, using a transphobic slur to describe them.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxyGQ6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gab-hack-data-breach-ddosecrets/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;first reported that a hacker&lt;/a&gt;, who goes by “JaXpArO and My Little Anonymous Revival Project,” carried out the hack to expose Gab’s users. Private messages from some 15,000 Gab users were used to create a dataset of more than 40 million posts from the site, including private posts. User profiles, some users’ hashed passwords, and passwords for groups also were affected by the hack, which reportedly used a SQL injection vulnerability to siphon some 70GB of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSsOCa"&gt;Activist data transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), plans to share the data with researchers and journalists but says it is not releasing it publicly due to privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUsa2a"&gt;“In a simpler or more ordinary time, it’d be an important sociological resource,” according to a &lt;a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/GabLeaks"&gt;blog post on the DDoSecrets wiki site&lt;/a&gt;. “In 2021, it’s also a record of the culture and the exact statements surrounding not only an increase in extremist views and actions, but an attempted coup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DzyjD"&gt;DDoSecrets co-founder Emma Best told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; the data was a “gold mine of research for people looking at militias, neo-Nazis, the far right, QAnon, and everything surrounding January 6,” when the US Capitol was attacked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ycz1qT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Since the attack on the Capitol, Gab has seen an 800 percent spike in traffic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bQYi7"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; first contacted Gab about the data breach, &lt;a href="https://news.gab.com/2021/02/26/alleged-data-breach-26-february-2021/"&gt;Torba wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Gab had not confirmed what it called the “alleged breach,” telling users that if the attack had “taken place as described, your passwords have not been revealed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5r0dG1"&gt;Torba later tweeted that the company &lt;em&gt;was,&lt;/em&gt; in fact, being attacked by hackers and was investigating. He said his own account and one for former President Trump were among those compromised. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgzkk7/gabs-real-donald-trump-isnt-really-donald-trump"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump account wasn’t actually affiliated with the former president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0IyrF"&gt;Since the attack on the Capitol, Gab has seen an 800 percent spike in traffic, and its registered user numbers have doubled, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/17/957512634/social-media-site-gab-is-surging-even-as-critics-blame-it-for-capitol-violence"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Anti-Defamation League has &lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-calls-on-us-justice-department-to-investigate-gab-for-possible-criminal"&gt;called for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Gab to determine “whether the social media platform intentionally aided or abetted” people who were involved in the riot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaGUyo"&gt;Torba founded Gab in 2016, styled as a free speech alternative to other social media sites. It gained notoriety in 2018 when a man posted an anti-Semitic message on the site before driving to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html"&gt;Pittsburgh and killing 11 people in a synagogue&lt;/a&gt;. Gab removed the account and cooperated with investigators but was dropped by its hosting platform and PayPal. Its app was kicked out of both Google and Apple’s app stores for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;violating hate speech policies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj1tXp"&gt;Gab did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart drops $35 order minimum for its two-hour delivery service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart profits jump in latest quarter during the coronavirus pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9OLknmGtwkH3HMSnu5UO9CsS_1s=/0x0:4660x3107/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891155/1268140215.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kena Betancur/VIEWpress via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FstpUw"&gt;Walmart is dropping its $35 minimum order requirement to qualify for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243557/walmart-express-delivery-two-hour-groceries-electronics"&gt;Express two-hour delivery service&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer announced on Monday. The move puts Walmart’s e-commerce platform on better footing to compete with Amazon Prime, which has offered customers same-day delivery for certain items in specific markets through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11575076/amazon-prime-now-delivery-web-site"&gt;Prime Now service&lt;/a&gt; since 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pBHyt"&gt;Walmart’s Express service promises two-hour delivery of “Walmart’s food, consumables and general merchandise assortment,” which includes produce, pantry items, household essentials, and other products. It typically costs $10 on top of a standard delivery fee ranging from $7.95 or $9.95, but Walmart waives the delivery fee if you subscribe to its Prime-like Walmart Plus subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kKEjFU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart is catching up to Amazon in the fast delivery department&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHnLf1"&gt;Walmart Express first launched in April of last year, and the company says it’s now available in close to 3,000 locations that reach 70 percent of the US population. Following today’s announcement, Express delivery may actually be a more attractive option than Amazon’s Prime Now, which still has a $35 order limit and is restricted to certain markets. It should, however, be noted that Prime Now is free for Prime members and only $4.99 per order if you don’t meet the order minimum, making it less expensive in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqRkZn"&gt;“Many customers use Express delivery for when they’re in a pinch, whether it be a missing ingredient for a weeknight dinner or a pack of diapers,” Tom Ward, Walmart’s senior vice president of customer product, said in a statement. “Customers told us sometimes the items they needed in a hurry didn’t meet the minimum, so we’re removing it, making it even easier for customers to get what they need when they need it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jit8d4"&gt;Walmart is slowly but surely catching up to the extreme convenience offered by its rival Amazon. Walmart last December &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22024753/walmart-plus-35-dollar-free-shipping-minimum-removed-amazon-prime-competition"&gt;dropped a similar $35 minimum order requirement&lt;/a&gt; for its Walmart Plus free next-day and two-day shipping perk, which put Walmart Plus on par with Amazon Prime in that regard. The retailer has also been expanding its grocery delivery options to better compete with Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods, both of which have been Amazon’s footholds into real-world commerce. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>President Biden denounces ‘anti-union propaganda’ ahead of Amazon union vote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Joe Biden arrives to the Oval Office Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, along the West Wing Colonnade of the White House. (Official White House Photo by Adam Schultz)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/du4Y-FkA2kLlettC2EanWZhDyxU=/0x0:1599x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891084/50987557506_f0ca4ba0c9_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/50987557506/" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Schultz for White House / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MhUh98"&gt;On Sunday night, President Joe Biden released &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1366191901196644354"&gt;a message of support for unionizing Amazon workers&lt;/a&gt; in Alabama, while sternly denouncing anti-union efforts by employers. The message comes in the midst of a contentious union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer. And while Biden stopped short of an explicit endorsement of the fledgling Bessemer union, he was broadly enthusiastic about the benefits of collective bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODFIfe"&gt;“I made it clear during my campaign that my policy would be to support unions organizing and the right to collectively bargain,” Biden said in the statement. “I’m keeping that promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D4We9T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZpUD9KgYc4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvf4YN"&gt;It’s rare for a sitting president to publicly support a union drive, and the statement is careful not to direct workers to vote in favor of unionization, as such statements might violate labor law. Biden never names Amazon directly in the statement, although he does directly name Alabama warehouse workers. He also denounces anti-union efforts in a way many will see as aimed at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UE0ns"&gt;“There should be no intimidation,” Biden says in the video, “no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoZdkz"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which is organizing the Bessemer worksite, applauded the statement. “As President Biden points out, the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is by organizing into unions,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum &lt;a href="https://www.rwdsu.info/potus_bamazon"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “And that is why so many working women and men are fighting for a union at the Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4vlQe"&gt;Amazon has been aggressive in its efforts to prevent the warehouse from unionizing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;inundating Alabama workers&lt;/a&gt; with text messages and worksite posters warning of the downsides of unionization. Last week, workers spotted anti-union ads running on Amazon-owned Twitch, although Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301352/twitch-removes-amazon-anti-union-ads"&gt;withdrew the ads&lt;/a&gt; once their existence was made public. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287191/amazon-alabama-warehouse-union-traffic-light-change-bessemer"&gt;In another incident&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon worked with county officials to alter the timing on a stoplight near the warehouse, making it harder for organizers to approach workers as they left the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfEIUq"&gt;In some instances, those efforts have provoked a backlash against the company. Last week, Amazon’s VP overseeing labor and employment law &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/27/amazon-american-constitution-society-andrew-devore-union/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=theintercept"&gt;abruptly resigned&lt;/a&gt; from the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal group that had recently appointed him to a three-year term. A coalition of members had &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJJVYfvVZrrO_xrae8iA2nMuXCKIpO2Z-DJskxBKAQtFdULg/viewform"&gt;called for his resignation in December&lt;/a&gt;, citing Amazon’s response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;a walkout at a Staten Island warehouse&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
