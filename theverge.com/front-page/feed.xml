    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xqWDa"&gt;Apple’s next iPad Pro may face supply constraints at launch due to issues in production, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s suppliers are said to be having trouble with low manufacturing yields for the new Mini LED display rumored to be the key feature of the new 12.9-inch model; one manufacturer has reportedly paused production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Ae6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373281/chip-shortage-apple-macbook-ipad-delay-nikkei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that iPad production had been delayed by a shortage of displays and display components, though the publication didn’t specify which models had been hit. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1381456421607202820"&gt;According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, the new iPad Pro lineup is still expected to be announced later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk6vNj"&gt;It’s possible, though, that the larger model may have a later shipping date. The smaller model reportedly won’t use the Mini LED display, but other upgrades across the line are said to include a faster processor similar in power to the M1 chip in Apple’s new Macs, as well as an upgraded USB-C port and better cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Cruella, The Woman in the Window, Loki, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlbRlWOPBVCBvFv1ilKOTLEDfg0=/151x0:1572x947/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69110315/cruella.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cruella | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpZrVxvG3mk&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=WaltDisneyStudios" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ewlRu"&gt;So yesterday I watched the first episode of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH18cKTmwZ8&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;Netflix documentary &lt;em&gt;This is a Robbery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; about the 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and the accents alone made me homesick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBVvWb"&gt;For those who did not grow up in the land of dropped R’s: two thieves dressed as cops stole 13 works from the museum, valued at a total of $500 million. The art, which included paintings by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas, and Manet, has never been found and no arrests have ever been made. The museum is &lt;a href="https://www.gardnermuseum.org/organization/theft"&gt;offering a $10 million reward&lt;/a&gt; for information leading to the recovery of the stolen works. I’m trying to avoid spoilers because even though I grew up in Boston and I’m familiar with the story, a few headlines about the doc have teased that it “solves” the case. Very interested to see the filmmakers’ theory of what happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3H7md"&gt;The trailer roundup for this week has villains, shut-ins, and Ghostbusters. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hdCn9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZIaqw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_0GJg_Jnlo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ngEfhO"&gt;The Woman in The Window &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjiK81"&gt;Getting strong &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m01YktiEZCw&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rear Window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vibes from the second trailer for this movie, which was supposed to premiere in theaters last May. Amy Adams stars as Anna Fox, a severely agoraphobic woman who suspects she witnessed the murder of her friend (played by Julianne Moore) in the neighboring building. Some serious gaslighting ensues. &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; also stars Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie, Tracy Letts, and Gary Oldman. It hits Netflix May 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bx9sVK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpZrVxvG3mk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wHepYG"&gt;Cruella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kaz0F7"&gt;This is the second trailer for the upcoming origin story of the villainess from &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians &lt;/em&gt;and it makes me think we’re supposed to be rooting for Cruella? Even though in the original movie she wanted to make a coat out of puppies? And is literally named “cruel devil”? I’m still not totally sold on the whole notion of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899422/joker-movie-review-todd-phillips-joaquin-phoenix-incel-violence-dc-comics-batman"&gt;origin story&lt;/a&gt; for a movie villain (and more are coming), but if Emmas Stone and Thompson are involved (Thompson’s character is the Baroness von Hellman... literally has “hell” right in her name) then it’s worth a look. &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters and on Disney Plus (for an additional fee)  on May 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RE5o13"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9eh37VDAG0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jzUgiB"&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5uBqRG"&gt;OK so this is a character-specific teaser trailer for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZFCF--uRY&amp;amp;t=2s&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sequel with Paul Rudd, introducing us to some cute? Scary? Menacing? Stay-Puft marshmallow... creatures. Mckenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard, Carrie Coon, and some of the original Ghostbusters will be in &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, which is slated for release in theaters November 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z08ffA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW948Va-l10?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eF3Tp0"&gt;Loki &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JAdHYl"&gt;The next spinoff series from Marvel is all about Loki, the trickster god of Asgard, and introduces the Time Variance Authority and Owen Wilson as Mobius. Tom Hiddleston is so good as Loki that perhaps I should retract or at least rethink my earlier statement about movie villains. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; comes to Disney Plus on June 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlr6nZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0gdgE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uKyQn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvdlm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS is a declaration of maximum electric luxury</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/71AiWnqHI83KzaaDTQAom6TyH0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69110274/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A first drive in the automaker’s electrified S-Class sedan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZFiJTa"&gt;Driving the new Mercedes-Benz EQS — essentially, the electric version of the automaker’s esteemed S-Class — almost gave me whiplash. Not because of some driving mishap (the EQS handles wonderfully) but because of how radically different Mercedes’ new luxury EV is from the recent crop of battery-powered vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb3ZXE"&gt;Mercedes has no interest in minimalist electric car design. The stark, button-less interiors of the Tesla Model 3 are fine for those who want to be reminded of a “completely cleared, black-washed Bauhaus living room,” as a &lt;a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/elektroauto-im-fahrbericht-das-model-3-ist-teslas-neues-glanzstueck-1.3866854"&gt;German writer once appropriately described Elon Musk’s mass-market EV&lt;/a&gt;. With the EQS, Mercedes is saying auf wiedersehen to the idea of sparsely appointed EV interiors. It has the largest screen, the highest range (so far), the most features, a truly shocking number of physical touchpoints, the softest headrests… I could go on. This is an all-electric S-Class in the truest sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aXzinO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mercedes is saying auf wiedersehen to the idea of sparsely appointed EV interiors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcIKP"&gt;I got a chance to test out the EQS for a few hours about a week before its official launch, and while it was delightful to drive and I truly appreciated getting to cosplay as a wealthy luxury car guy, I had to wonder what the point was of all this extra stuff. Why do I need a gazillion different colored options for ambient lighting? Why does the front passenger need their own dedicated screen embedded in the dashboard? Why was there a fingerprint scanner &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a facial recognition scanner? How much is too much massage for a driver’s seat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puFCcl"&gt;The obvious answer is that S-Class customers expect the best. But more is not necessarily better. All of this stuff is not inherently bad, but there was a lingering sense that a lot of it was superfluous. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3j9muCo4o0"&gt;To paraphrase the good doctor Ian Malcolm&lt;/a&gt;, Mercedes’ engineers were so preoccupied with whether they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; add a shimmering water effect to the bodies of water in the EQS’s 3D map that they didn’t stop to think if they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_7676CRpaZbDpdJjC9iImYmMeg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434235/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0024.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xs0-me8h-i9tjz9QJ4OqqeJOlqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434234/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1ibnfx"&gt;Let’s get some specs out of the way first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6QzDdh"&gt;The EQS will sprint 0 to 60 mph in a little over 4 seconds and will be top speed-limited to 130 mph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9Slps8"&gt;It will come in two battery sizes: 90kWh and 107.8kWh. By way of comparison, the most powerful Tesla, the long-range Model S, has a 100kWh battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yVlwJZ"&gt;The 107.8kWh battery has an estimated range of up to 770 km (478.5 miles) based on the generous WLTP standard. (The EPA rated range will definitely be lower.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H4EZSn"&gt;The 400-volt architecture is liquid-cooled through special cavities cast into the aluminum battery housing that automatically preheats or cools as needed to speed charging. This could be very useful in priming the battery before it charges, especially in winter temperatures. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XlQBk3"&gt;When plugged into a 200kWh fast charger, the EQS’s battery will add about 300 kilometers (186 miles) in 15 minutes. That’s faster than most of Mercedes’ competitors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZeWnZ"&gt;It will be eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35044132/plug-and-charge-ev-charging-mustang-mach-e/"&gt;Plug and Charge system&lt;/a&gt;, a technological concept initially introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55365.html"&gt;ISO 15118&lt;/a&gt;, the international standard for charging EVs. That means the EQS will be compatible with about 90 percent of the public charging stations in the US without the need to download an app or sign up for an individual charging service. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3UX0Vj"&gt;In electric vehicles, better aerodynamics equal improved range — so the bodywork is ultra-low drag. Mercedes claims the 0.20 drag coefficient as the best in the world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wUdy4v"&gt;It will come in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZSKa0c"&gt;The single-motor configuration will get 329 horsepower with rear-wheel drive, while the dual-motor/all-wheel drive trim level will get 516 horsepower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hvVBL1"&gt;Now let’s talk about the giant pillar-to-pillar 55-inch touchscreen, which Mercedes calls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217267/mercedes-benz-hyperscreen-size-specs-eqs-ces-2021"&gt;the Hyperscreen&lt;/a&gt;. First teased earlier this year, the Hyperscreen is the locus of the automaker’s second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt; that eschews physical buttons in favor of a completely digital (and voice-controlled) user experience. And if you thought it looked big in pictures, I can promise you it’s even bigger in real life. This thing absolutely gobbles up the interior of the EQS.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XAHRf"&gt;But it isn’t one seamless display; it’s actually three separate screens embedded in one solid piece of curved glass. I expected some kind of graphical interplay, much like how you can share windows between a laptop and an external monitor, but the screens remained rigidly segregated from each other. It felt like a missed opportunity for Mercedes to show off its design chops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqjvfQmEI5Q38e3PC5jgn9U1y2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434241/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0035.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqR98UP9NSJAlU8RXOuHRXTxjh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434240/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_gCpvKHjoxwIO_EjMgcVY922CU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434242/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DfkCKf"&gt;That said, it’s very easy to get lost in the pixelated wilderness of the EQS’s Hyperscreen. Mercedes insists the Hyperscreen has been designed to avoid distraction. The operating system uses artificial intelligence to learn which features you use the most, then surfaces those features as individual widgets on the main screen. Ideally, you don’t have to rummage through too many sub-menus to find what you want. The company claims drivers can find “90 percent” of what they’re looking for on the first layer of the screen without having to scroll through menus or use the voice assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rb91Ko"&gt;The voice assistant was fine, but like most in-car systems, there’s a noticeable lag — at least three to five seconds — between asking the question and getting the acknowledgment from the car. It’s not a huge deal, but it did lead to some awkward cross-talk between me and the MBUX system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ3iWv"&gt;The EQS’s map was ludicrously detailed, with the 3D option especially beautiful. But I rarely needed to look at the map for navigation, thanks to the impressive heads-up display (HUD). The HUD uses augmented reality (AR) to project 3D arrows in the driver’s field of vision for turn-by-turn navigation. The arrows stretch out in front of the car and even curve around corners to guide the driver in the right direction. Toggling through the HUD display settings, I came across an option that projects an AR green orb that would glow orange and then red as I accelerated. It was very trippy, but I’m not sure what purpose it served. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tH3Kcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was very trippy, but I’m not sure what purpose it served&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fRxTl6"&gt;Like any good luxury EV, the EQS allows you to factor battery capacity into your route planning. If you want to show up at your destination with, say, 45 percent charge left in your battery, the EQS will suggest a charging station along your route, as well as the amount of time you would need to be plugged in in order to achieve that result. With the EV charging network still rather shambolic, a feature like this can help shave off some of that range anxiety that can accompany EV ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXK2oV"&gt;In terms of processing power, Mercedes says the Hyperscreen is powered by 8 CPU cores, 24GB of RAM, and 46.4GB-per-second RAM memory bandwidth. I didn’t really experience any lag while swiping through menus, pinching and zooming on the map, or typing in locations into the search bar. The type function had a satisfying “clack-clack” sound effect that reminded me a little bit of a Qwerty keyboard on a BlackBerry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93MF7z"&gt;I would need another week with the EQS to truly understand everything that’s going on in the instrument cluster. There is a lot! There are four different displays you can toggle through, and I found the “Understated” display most to my liking. Graphically, it’s gorgeous; the “Sport” display features glowing blue and red parentheses framing what appears to be a misty landscape overlooking a rippled jeweled star? Honestly, what were these Mercedes engineers smoking?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dictXZ"&gt;Like the graphical displays, there’s a lot of customization inherent in the ride quality of the EQS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5SZwxd"&gt;There’s regenerative braking, which Mercedes calls “intelligent recuperation” and is similar to one-pedal driving in most electric vehicles. That means you press the acceleration pedal to accelerate or cruise and release the pedal to brake. When the pedal is released, the regenerative braking kicks in, supplying some power back into the battery. The level of regenerative braking, as well as the weight and feel of the one-pedal system, can be adjusted using the plus or minus paddles behind the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIBYeU"&gt;There are also four driving modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport, and Individual. To toggle between them, you press a button located in the center console next to the start/stop button. This panel felt janky, even slightly loose, like I could pull the whole thing out of the center console if I applied enough force. The same went for the air vents embedded at either end of the Hyperscreen. They felt cheaper than they should in an electrified S-Class. The EQS I drove was a pre-production version, so there’s still a chance to tighten up some of these accessories before final production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nr11xE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They felt cheaper than they should in an electrified S-Class&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9bAgV"&gt;I found Comfort to be the, well, most comfortable driving mode, while Sport certainly offered its fair share of torque-induced thrills. There was nothing jerky about the acceleration, just smooth refinement. The EQS really grips the road while you’re driving, thanks to a low center of gravity provided by the battery pack placed in the floor of the vehicle. The turning radius of the EQS is better than that of the conventional S-Class sedan due to a rear-wheel turning feature that was really amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqexHC"&gt;The regenerative braking was fine but took some getting used to. What’s really impressive was the amount of power it sends back into the battery. Mercedes claims the EQS is the champ here, too, able to regeneratively brake at up to 290kW with all-wheel drive version. That’s better than the 265kW record held by the Porsche Taycan Turbo S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-8jaEb1LUSmRzk0wxCN4qVTUKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434236/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0025.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JnnXlK"&gt;The front and rear section of the EQS was still camouflaged when I drove it. You can probably extrapolate some of the design features of the EQS based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqs-concept-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;Vision EQS concept car&lt;/a&gt; that was released last year. I’m intrigued to learn whether Mercedes keeps the completely digital front grille or goes with something more analog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4SfHr"&gt;The body of the vehicle was unlike any sedan I’ve ever seen before. Mercedes is really throwing down the gauntlet on aerodynamic design, with a sleek, flowing silhouette that almost erases any hint of a traditional sedan form. That will definitely help improve the vehicle’s range and also create a more quiet cabin environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWLbEC"&gt;The door handles can extend and retract, depending on whether you’re getting in or locking up. And all four doors can be opened or closed automatically using either the key fob or the touchscreen. This was probably my favorite feature. Even a small push of the door handle will trigger the automatic closing function. Robot doors! What’s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rXjhsA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automatic doors! What’s not to love?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7O1PG9"&gt;That said, if it gets too quiet, you can always turn the fake ambient motor noise to trick your brain into thinking there’s more going on underneath the hood. The EQS’s fake motor noise, which Mercedes describes as “soundscapes,” wasn’t as noticeable as the kazoo-esque sound made by the Volkswagen ID 4; it was more of a background hum that wasn’t totally annoying. Future soundscapes can be downloaded via an over-the-air software update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNQ1sS"&gt;Speaking of the hood, Mercedes did not include a front trunk, or frunk, in the EQS. Moreover, the area under the hood will be completely inaccessible to EQS owners. There was a weird side compartment right above the front-left wheel where you can refill the windshield wiper fluid, but other than that, the hood is off limits. It’s a very odd choice that I can see rubbing a lot of owners the wrong way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kenjaYsF6F4CBv7dLcV2BU0rfWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22434227/ahawkins_20210404_4511_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiSZtg"&gt;Ultimately, I wasn’t completely seduced by the EQS. It’s a beautiful electric car with so much going on above and below the surface that I feel like I’ll need at least a month in order to sort it all out. The Hyperscreen lives up to its name, for better or worse. And while it will certainly be popular among a certain segment of monied car buyers, the EQS will not revolutionize the electric car market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFXiUg"&gt;That’s because it’s already happened. It’s been nearly a decade since the Tesla Model S was first introduced, nabbing all those early adopters with its sleek blend of technological efficiency and addictively fun driving style. Elon Musk’s company is planning on rolling out a refreshed version of the Model S this year, maybe around the same time that the EQS hits dealerships. But it’s unclear to me what the EQS offers over the Model S other than a more cluttered interior and a higher sticker price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJRQIU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the EQS will not revolutionize the electric car market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vXyzgN"&gt;No question the three-pointed star logo will be all it takes from some interested buyers, but it’s clear that Mercedes is still struggling with the S-Class’ reputation as an “old man car.” &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a33928077/s-class-in-the-age-of-suv/"&gt;A rich old man&lt;/a&gt;, to be sure, but definitely geriatric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="na9Y1E"&gt;The EQS is about to dive into a luxury EV segment that is already very crowded with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13628872/jaguar-ipace-concept-electric-car-suv-unveiled-la-auto-show-2016-photos"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;. Other vehicles will soon follow, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;BMW i4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357789/lexus-lf-z-electrified-concept-car-ev-toyota-electric"&gt;Lexus LF-Z&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt;. Do we really need more luxury electric cars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pm1Na3"&gt;Obviously, no luxury electric segment would be complete without a battery-powered S-Class. Mercedes is widely seen as lagging behind other major automakers in the release of new electric vehicles. The company’s $68,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17818836/mercedes-benz-eqc-suv-ev-specs-photos"&gt;EQC SUV&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to start shipping in the US at the start of 2020, but that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024073/mercedes-benz-eqc-electric-delay-us-launch-2021"&gt;pushed to 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sNUlS6"&gt;Now, it looks like the EQS will actually be Mercedes’ first EV to come to North America. That means there will be a lot riding on it when it does come out. And if the company is going to make good on its promise to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504049/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-sedan-eqe-suv"&gt;release 10 new EVs by 2022&lt;/a&gt;, it really needs to smash that acceleration pedal — or at the very least, turn off the one-pedal driving.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it will send a witness to Senate hearing on app stores after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxvfy5MYV2A2o2l-kYDwt8pylbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69109994/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjupRR"&gt;After several senators criticized the company, Apple said on Sunday it would send its chief compliance officer to an April 21st hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the office of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday demanding that the company send a representative to the hearing, saying Apple was refusing to participate. &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter&lt;/a&gt;, Klobuchar and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) say Apple “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for the hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNWqPC"&gt;But on Sunday, Apple sent a letter to the senators saying it was “surprised” by their letter and that it had intended to participate, but simply sought a change in the date. “We have a deep respect for your role and process on these matters,” the letter reads, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/apple-makes-top-executive-available-at-senate-app-store-hearing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company will make Kyle Andeer— who Apple says has represented the company before the US House of Representatives and several states—available on April 21st. “We look forward to sharing our perspective on our App Store,” the letter states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCfE13"&gt;Lee said in a joint statement with Klobuchar emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Sunday that he was glad Apple had “changed course and agreed to testify before the committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3umhb"&gt;Klobuchar said in the statement the hearing will explore “whether Apple and Google are using their power as gatekeepers to charge high fees and impose restrictions that suppress competition in mobile applications and related markets, and both companies‘ participation in the hearing is necessary.” She added that the companies “have the power to control how and if mobile app developers can reach app users, and ultimately, which apps become successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. Its App Store practices, including the 30 percent fees it charges developers, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers in recent months. Apple also has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;battling with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, which sued the iPhone maker for what it claims are violations of antitrust law. That trial is slated to get underway May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UDXOY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 11th 5:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds statement from Sens. Klobuchar and Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>French lawmakers vote to ban some domestic flights to reduce carbon emissions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PA5C54"&gt;French lawmakers have voted to ban domestic flights on routes that could be taken in a train ride in less than two-and-a-half hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-france-flights-idUSKBN2BY0AO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The vote late Saturday comes as part of France’s larger climate bill, which seeks to reduce its 1990-level carbon emissions by 40 percent over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGgZgs"&gt;Last week, France’s government said it would contribute 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) to recapitalize airline Air France-KLM. The airline warned it is expecting an operating loss of 1.3 billion euros when it reports its first-quarter earnings next month. The airline industry is reeling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a sharp reduction in global travel over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7icPK"&gt;“We know that aviation is a contributor of carbon dioxide and that because of climate change we must reduce emissions,” France’s Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runachershe told Europe 1 radio. “Equally, we must support our companies and not let them fall by the wayside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbVx9N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/back-to-the-future-airline-sector-poised-for-change-post-covid-19"&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Co. analysts estimate&lt;/a&gt; the airline industry will continue to feel the effects of the coronavirus pandemic for several years, predicting that air traffic won’t get back to 2019 levels until 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNBO8G"&gt;The bill to cut back domestic flights goes next to France’s Senate for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse CEO says user data was not leaked, contrary to reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1LE1u1OdUfNNDeO2YjEE2T9XWI=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108912/1232148642.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4eTW0P"&gt;Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison said Sunday that a report claiming personal user data had been leaked was “false.”  &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/clubhouse-data-leak-1-3-million-user-records-leaked-for-free-online/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; a SQL database with users’ IDs, names, usernames, Twitter and Instagram handles and follower counts were posted to an online hacker forum. According to &lt;em&gt;Cyber News, &lt;/em&gt;it did not appear that sensitive user information such as credit card numbers were among the leaked info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzRTqg"&gt;Clubhouse did not immediately reply to a request for more information from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday. But Davison said in response to a question during a town hall that the platform had not suffered a data breach. “No, This is misleading and false, it is a clickbait article, we were not hacked. The data referred to was all public profile information from our app. So the answer to that is a definitive ‘no.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HNpFD"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Cyber News&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374464/linkedin-data-leak-500-million-accounts-scraped-microsoft"&gt;personal data for 500 million LinkedIn users&lt;/a&gt; had been scraped and posted online. The Microsoft-owned company said that no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqEDzU"&gt;That news came just a couple of days after it was discovered that personal data for some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;533 million Facebook users&lt;/a&gt; was leaked online for free. The Facebook leak reportedly included users’ phone numbers, birthdates, locations, email addresses, and full names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z3HPp"&gt;Clubhouse had a monster first year—despite being invite-only and available only on iOS devices— seeing more than 10 million downloads. Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; have all launched or are working on competing social audio platforms, and  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; reportedly has one in the works as well. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0kWpia"&gt;Google is shutting down its mobile Shopping apps for both iOS and Android and directing users to its web Shopping site instead, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/google-shopping-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported. On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-shopping-app-being-killed-off/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xda Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the term “sunset” had been added to several strings of code in the Shopping app, suggesting the apps were being discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxSVpZ"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;9to5 Google&lt;/em&gt; that the apps will continue to function through June. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Within the next few weeks, we’ll no longer be supporting the Shopping app. All of the functionality the app offered users is available on the Shopping tab,” the spokesperson said. We’ll continue building features within the Shopping tab and other Google surfaces, including the Google app.” The &lt;a href="http://shopping.google.com"&gt;shopping.google.com&lt;/a&gt; site will remain active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2C0bS3"&gt;The app allowed users to choose from among thousands of online stores and make purchases using their Google accounts. to quickly shop across thousands of stores and purchase stuff using your Google Account. This user found the Android app to be working normally on Sunday, but some users were already seeing a “something went wrong” message when they tried to use the Shopping app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3lA23j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RIP Google Shopping's mobile app. Google is preparing to sunset it.

    <title>South Korea EV battery makers reach settlement in US trade dispute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SK Innovation Co logo seen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNVSVxaa-7fxRKIiooXAgtOYbqE=/0x384:4608x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108820/1070303268.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BqngrE"&gt;South Korean electric-vehicle battery makers SK Innovation and LG Energy Solution have reached a settlment in a US trade dispute, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-10/ford-vw-battery-supplier-said-to-reach-deal-to-avoid-import-ban?utm_source=url_link&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Under the terms of the agreement, SK will pay $1.8 billion (2 trillion won) in cash and royalties to LG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOtNIP"&gt;In a joint statement the companies said they would “work to help the development of EV battery industry in South Korea and the US. through healthy competition and friendly cooperation,” adding that they would “work together to strengthen the battery network and environmentally-friendly policy that the Biden administration is pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8suLsg"&gt;In February, the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9481d70b-827b-476d-9e0b-21245321e289"&gt;imposed a 10-year import ban&lt;/a&gt; on SK Innovation— due to take effect Sunday— following allegations it illegally obtained technology from rival LG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EOjAq"&gt;The settlement will prevent an import ban on SK Innovation batteries into the US, which would have been problematic for the Biden administration. Ford and Volkswagen both are slated to start production on electric vehicles next year, using batteries made at SK’s plant in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0gJBi"&gt;“This settlement agreement is a win for American workers and the American auto industry,” President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/11/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-electric-battery-dispute-settlement/"&gt;said in a statement Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. “A key part of my plan to Build Back Better is to have the electric vehicles and batteries of the future built here in America, all across America, by American workers. We need a strong, diversified and resilient US-based electric vehicle battery supply chain, so we can supply the growing global demand for these vehicles and components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp0N8A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2nix_zd-RTVqievZhpUQKgS4w_Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108712/ajohnson_210222_4437__005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Stylo 6 is one of the company’s bestselling phones in recent history.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company leaves a void that brands like Motorola and TCL are well-positioned to fill&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zHTSjt"&gt;LG’s exit from the smartphone business felt inevitable in the weeks leading up to it as rumors mounted. When it was finally confirmed, Avi Greengart, a longtime consumer tech analyst and president of Techsponential, noticed a trend toward nostalgia in the reactions to the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zosnHP"&gt;“I’m not getting a lot of people saying ‘What will I do to replace my LG G8X ThinQ?’ I’m getting ‘Aw, my first phone was an LG flip phone, and it was durable and reliable and I loved it.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuJe7t"&gt;As someone who spent many years covering the digital camera market, it’s a very familiar moment to me. We mourn the loss of the brand that gave us our first flip phone or our first camera with a tweet and a broken heart emoji. But truthfully, we moved on long ago, as did most of the rest of the phone- or camera-buying population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t7t3Mw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ChXH3e"&gt;Things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11525306/lg-g5-earnings-q1-2016"&gt;weren’t looking good&lt;/a&gt; for LG’s phone business in 2016 when it introduced the modular G5, and the ecosystem’s failure to take off perpetuated what would become years of losses for the mobile division. In 2020, the smartphone business &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fpdf%2Fir_report%2F20%25204Q%2520Earning%2520Release%2520of%2520LGE.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F11%2F22375938%2Flg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recorded an operational loss of around $750 million for the year&lt;/a&gt;; the company promised to “closely review the direction of the business,” and we know now how that turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHTQMi"&gt;While most shoppers have moved on, there are still gaps left in the market when a Kodak or an LG packs it in. “This is a void. When they do leave, this will be a void,” says Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC’s Mobile Device Tracker division. He says that through last year, LG still held close to 10 percent market share in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84KiyC"&gt;In particular, the company still had a solid foothold in the prepaid device business. Greengart doesn’t think there will be any lack of appetite to snap up that share of the market. “The competition there is brutal. The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.” The company’s Redmi and Poco lineups might be good candidates, with a focus on bringing high-end features and solid performance to affordable handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8l9WYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real question is will US carriers invite a new brand in — someone like Xiaomi would be my longshot.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfyPlb"&gt;Greengart also notes that OnePlus already has a foot in the door at Metro by T-Mobile, the carrier’s prepaid sub-brand. Samsung has already announced that it will sell two of its least expensive A-series phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;the A02s and A12&lt;/a&gt;, through prepaid brands like Cricket and Metro this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWl2U6"&gt;As for the sub-$300 space in general, there’s no shortage of brands ready to pounce. “I would say the two brands that are probably going to take that share going to be Motorola and TCL,” Reith says. He notes that Motorola is already well-positioned to pick up LG’s Latin American customers, which was recently about 30 percent of its mobile phone business. Even on an individual device level, there are obvious heirs: one of LG’s last bestselling devices is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt;, and its sole competitor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt;, is quite frankly a better phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b19Eaj"&gt;TCL has also made it clear in the past couple of years that it’s eager to get its own brand devices into more consumers’ hands, in addition to the phones the company already makes for other brands. Reith says he’s “bullish” on the company’s prospects, as more US shoppers have become familiar with the brand name by way of its TV business. If one thing’s certain, it’s that more than a few companies are in a good position to fill that void LG leaves behind. As Greengart puts it, “Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o55aMP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Undoubtedly there will be plenty of substitutes; in fact there already are.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DH5Gs2"&gt;Although LG only had a small presence in the premium market, there’s a gap left there too — even if it’s mostly symbolic. The few devices the company still sold were an alternative to the two dominant brands in the US: Apple and Samsung. Especially considering the lower cost of entry to the S21 series this year, those remaining customers will likely be easily scooped up by the duopoly. “The market is mostly Apple and Samsung in the United States,” says Greengart. “If it was concentrated before, it’s even more concentrated today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6wpis"&gt;Realistically though, the market had already spoken. LG’s efforts at bold, unusual designs in the premium space never caught on and spelled serious trouble for the business. Reith points to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;the LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; as an example. “To come up with a design like that… it takes so much money for R&amp;amp;D, that when you put that out and it only sells thousands of units — not hundreds of thousands, but &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of units — it’s a big, big loss,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rfzHOP"&gt;LG’s premium devices may have been interesting and unique, but the market spoke, and the company’s mobile phone exit became seemingly inevitable. That’s how these things work, and a multitude of companies are ready to swoop in and pick up where LG left off. But whether you follow mobile tech closely or just have a special place in your heart for your old flip phone, many of us will still take the opportunity to pause and shed a digital emoji tear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly ran secret ‘Project Bernanke’ that boosted its own ad-buying system over competitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSEhvxYAFq6hozN3kqmpgE3Mr3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69108688/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1nPWG"&gt;Google reportedly ran a secret project called “Project Bernanke” that relied on bidding data collected from advertisers using its ad exchange to benefit the company’s own ad system, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-secret-project-bernanke-revealed-in-texas-antitrust-case-11618097760?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. First discovered by newswire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhushitaVasant/status/1379955848118726659?s=20"&gt;service MLex&lt;/a&gt;, the name of the project was visible in an inadvertently unredacted document Google had filed as part of an antitrust lawsuit in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EKR7S"&gt;A federal judge has since let Google refile the document under seal. But according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, “Bernanke” was not disclosed to outside advertisers, and proved lucrative for Google, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the company. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Google in December, alleging that the search giant was using anticompetitive tactics in which “Bernanke” was a major part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skiRF5"&gt;Google wrote in the unredacted filing that data from Project Bernanke was “comparable to data maintained by other buying tools,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The company was able to access historical data about bids made through Google Ads, to change bids by its clients and boost the clients’ chances of winning auctions for ad impressions, putting rival ad tools at a disadvantage. Texas cited in court documents an internal presentation from 2013 in which Google said Project Bernanke would bring in $230 million in revenue for that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaRVoq"&gt;Why Google chose to name the secret project “Bernanke” is not clear. Ben Bernanke, who was chair of the Federal Reserve from 2006 to 2014, is probably the best-known Bernanke in the public sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21R7Dw"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said the complaint by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton “misrepresents many aspects of our ad tech business. We look forward to making our case in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmGMH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 11th 10:54AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Google spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
