    <title>Apple says iMessage on Android ‘will hurt us more than help us’  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBZmZy"&gt;Apple knows that iMessage’s blue bubbles are a big barrier to people switching to Android, which is why the service has never appeared on Google’s mobile operating system. That’s according to depositions and emails from Apple employees, including some high-ranking executives, revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;a court filing&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;as part of its legal dispute&lt;/a&gt; with the iPhone manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVNGvI"&gt;Epic argues that Apple consciously tries to lock customers into its ecosystem of devices, and that iMessage is one of the key services helping it to do so. It cites comments made by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller to support its argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oKuZvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Three questions that will decide Epic v. Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="32yjX7"&gt;“The #1 most difficult [reason] to leave the Apple universe app is iMessage ... iMessage amounts to serious lock-in,” was how one unnamed former Apple employee put it in an email in 2016, prompting Schiller to respond that, “moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tLvPQo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AWdybq"&gt;“iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” was Federighi’s concern according to the Epic filing. Although workarounds to using iMessage on Android have emerged over the years, none have been particularly convenient or reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj5gKJ"&gt;According to Epic’s filing, citing Eddie Cue, Apple decided not to develop iMessage for Android as early as 2013, following the launch of the messaging service with iOS 5 in 2011. Cue admits that Apple “could have made a version on Android that worked with iOS” so that “users of both platforms would have been able to exchange messages with one another seamlessly.” Evidently, such a version was never developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwsUJV"&gt;Along with iMessage, Epic cites a series of other Apple services that it argues contribute to lock-in. Notably, these include its video chat service FaceTime, which Steve Jobs announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOxf9tEXEKQ"&gt;would be an open industry standard&lt;/a&gt; back at WWDC 2010. FaceTime subsequently released across iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but it’s not officially available for any non-Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q968OH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEF7T5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Imposters steal restaurants’ names in delivery app deception</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Proposed Ban On Bluefin Tuna Rejected At World Trade Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/crSKkdQjNjFO_ioyVWIjJ-A910Y=/62x0:2939x1918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098988/97868336.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PU7a0"&gt;Ordering delivery through an app like DoorDash or GrubHub saves the trouble of cooking and lets you be a little picky — you can order from your favorite restaurant. But imagine receiving your food, sitting down to eat, and it tasting... &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. And then, following your gut, you learn that you’ve been duped by a fake, an imposter restaurant that stole its name. For many people ordering from two Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, that exact thing may have happened, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/On-Doordash-these-S-F-sushi-spots-look-like-16078920.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irTysa"&gt;One restaurant, now styled as an izakaya called Chome, originally opened for delivery and takeout in the former location of Blowfish Sushi. Except it didn’t bother to change the name, awning, or logo at the start. Chome, operating as if it were Blowfish Sushi, served sushi to people ordering through apps like GrubHub, Postmates, DoorDash, and Uber Eats using the identity of a restaurant that closed in December 2020. Before it closed, Blowfish Sushi had been serving its neighborhood for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GE5mv"&gt;Blowfish’s former owner, Jason Teplitsky, was not exactly thrilled. “How does someone decide to do something like this? Did they think we all got COVID and died?” Teplitsky tells the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-MTes26QnTrdE7PnbcyWWMjTak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430912/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_3.28.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Wagyumafia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real Wagyumafia is famous for its use of wagyu beef &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WyYK82"&gt;Another fake restaurant, SF Wagyumafia, shares the name of &lt;a href="https://www.wagyumafia.com/"&gt;a famous sandwich shop&lt;/a&gt; known for its $180 wagyu sandwich and locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong. This San Francisco restaurant has no connection with the actual chain, according to the real Wagyumafia, but it was advertising the $180 sandwich. The fake was convincing enough to initially fool one food writer, the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes. When you’re ordering through an app without any real way to gauge what you’re getting into, what can you do but take a restaurant at its word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dPCu7"&gt;At first glance, both these restaurants might seems like &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact"&gt;ghost kitchen schemes&lt;/a&gt; gone awry. They’re seemingly focused on delivery, readily accessible through the most popular apps, and of an unknown origin. But blatantly copying other well-known restaurants to the point that people mistake one for the other, or think a classic has suddenly reopened, seems more like straightforward fraud. The new “Blowfish Sushi” even registered as Blowfish with the city of San Francisco, which makes it seem like the owner knew what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvmEC3"&gt;Teplitsky and the original Wagyumafia are considering legal action, according to the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCALkR"&gt;In response to the concerns over both restaurants’ legitimacy, DoorDash and GrubHub have removed Wagyumafia and Blowfish Sushi from their listings,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/DoorDash-and-Grubhub-removed-imposter-S-F-sushi-16081842.php"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn’t able to find a listing for either restaurant on Postmates or Uber Eats, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyBNPb"&gt;DoorDash, Postmates, GrubHub, and Uber Eats either didn’t respond to our questions about how they verify restaurant listings in the first place, or weren’t able to tell us whether they have any specific protections to keep one restaurant from stealing another restaurant’s name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Xiig"&gt;GrubHub did reply with a generic description of its practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KsmjA0"&gt;We have no tolerance for misconduct or misuse of the Grubhub platform. We have a number of safeguards in place to prevent potentially fraudulent listings on our marketplace and we are constantly improving our processes and testing new features to prevent these situations. In the case of any listings that might be fraudulent, we immediately investigate and remove them from the marketplace if they’re in fact fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DW1LML"&gt;And DoorDash provided something similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="31h5RR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At DoorDash, we work to ensure that we are always offering the highest quality of service to merchants, Dashers and customers. We take these types of allegations seriously and we’ve suspended the Merchants from the platform as we investigate the matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0JO8Gg"&gt;In GrubHub’s case, it says fraud like this isn’t widespread, but says it’s unable to explain exactly how it prevents fraudulent listing because doing so would potentially make its methods no longer useful. Typically these companies check banking and tax information to setup payments, so there are some required details that could potentially corroborate a restaurant’s identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nh67RE"&gt;Fake restaurants aren’t the only surprises potentially awaiting you in food delivery apps: some legitimate brands have also tried to entice diners by changing their name for delivery. Remember, that pizza you purchase from Pasqually’s &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/chuck-e-cheese-pasquallys-pizza-wings-new-menu"&gt;actually comes from Chuck E. Cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG33Q2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 8th, 11:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from DoorDash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtmKaR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch: Elon Musk’s Neuralink says this monkey is playing Pong with its mind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A monkey and his Pong" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HU0SB6icGNQO3h2JSn2c7Kj1ERk=/201x0:1452x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098959/Screen_Shot_2021_04_08_at_5.53.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGGXWp"&gt;Neuralink, Elon Musk’s company focused on developing brain-machine interfaces, has posted a video to YouTube that appears to show a monkey navigating an on-screen cursor using only its mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBKK7B"&gt;Pager, a 9-year-old macaque monkey, had a Neuralink implanted about six weeks before the video was shot, the video’s unnamed narrator says. He was first taught to play video games with a joystick for a banana smoothie reward, delivered through a metal straw. While he was doing this, the Neuralink device recorded information about which neurons were firing — learning, essentially, to predict hand movements by recording which regions fired. After learning the patterns, the joystick Pager used to play was disconnected from the computer. The monkey appears to go on playing the game using only his mind — playing a game of Pong with no joystick whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xhOZdb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neuralink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Neuralink&lt;/a&gt; product will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380315654524301315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3jOnNl"&gt;This style of scientific release is unusual; ordinarily, videos like this are supplementary material to peer-reviewed papers published in scientific journals. Those papers contain data that can be checked by other scientists. It’s believable that a monkey might play video games using a brain implant — after all, a paralyzed man has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/21/8639905/brain-control-robot-arm-paralyzed-quadriplegic"&gt;already used a robotic arm and a non-Neuralink brain implant to drink beer&lt;/a&gt;.  Pong is a classic of brain-machine interfaces — in 2006, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/13/science/13brain.html"&gt;Matthew Nagle did a similar feat with four days’ worth of training&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDoT4V"&gt;In July 2019, Musk said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot"&gt;a monkey had already been able to control a computer&lt;/a&gt; with its brain and the Neuralink implant. Since then, we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;seen demonstrations of the Neuralink technology in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Today, Musk tweeted that Neuralink might let a paralyzed person tweet faster than a person using their thumbs on a smartphone. A later goal, he said in a follow-up tweet, will be to send signals from Neuralinks in the brain to Neuralinks in major body neural clusters, “thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA for US Congresspeople: here’s how to set your Venmo feed to private</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/94MYrHJAyZdxX6objgbbvZj1zcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098920/akrales_171110_2136_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NFeYMI"&gt;Hello, yes, it has come to my attention that Matt Gaetz left his Venmo feed public and &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; has used this public feed to &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gaetz-paid-accused-sex-trafficker-who-then-venmod-teen"&gt;report a salacious story&lt;/a&gt; about his transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75xmWU"&gt;Yeah, you read that right. His Venmo feed was&lt;em&gt; public&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yXxXdf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A public Venmo feed, &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;one with questionable transactions, is a powerful way to amass personal information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N9MeBL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-scary-reasons-you-should-make-your-venmo-account-private-2018-07-17"&gt;People have been warning&lt;/a&gt; about Venmo’s public feeds for quite some time. You can figure out a lot about a person by monitoring their financial transactions through Venmo! In Gaetz’s case, we found out he sent money — $900, in two transactions— to Joel Greenberg, who is accused of sex trafficking. The morning after Gaetz sent money, Greenberg sent three young women sums of money that totaled... $900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjg0Ot"&gt;I didn’t think this need to be said, but here we are: If you have a Venmo account, and you are a congressperson, please do me a solid and go check on your security settings. You might think, “Liz, why would you, a reporter, discourage transparency?” Well, because reporters aren’t the only ones who snoop. Next time it might be a state actor amassing damaging information! A public Venmo feed, &lt;em&gt;especially &lt;/em&gt;one with questionable transactions, is a powerful way to amass personal information — who you spend time with most, what you do together, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gf0Ola"&gt;Here’s how: Go to the Venmo app on your phone. Press on the hamburger menu. Then tap “settings.” Next, tap “privacy.” You will get three options and the one you want is “private” so that only you and the person you’re dealing with get to see the transaction. I guess you could set it to “friends” but you’re a US Congressperson, so you might have friends who’d leak to the press. Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GmmVe"&gt;Now, you need to do something else: hide anything public from the past. Go to “privacy” and under “past transactions,” set everything to private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhNHvv"&gt;This is infosec 101! Please include this article in the next national security briefing. Clearly Congress needs to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHfKTG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Students of color are getting flagged to their teachers because testing software can’t see them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_GdzJe51wmRaLLwooBpDCERW1bs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098820/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zrXZwN"&gt;Proctorio, a piece of exam surveillance software designed to keep students from cheating while taking tests, relies on open-source software that has a history of racial bias issues, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue was discovered by a student who figured out how the software did facial detection, and discovered that it fails to recognize black faces over half the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X4dJ"&gt;Proctorio, and other programs like it, is designed to keep an eye on students while they’re taking tests. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cham_omot/status/1364376131516854275"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; students of color &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/allseeingKHAI/status/1304421435385851904?s=20"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kikyo1506/status/1304441930772656128?s=20"&gt;have issues getting the software&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigLou_42/status/1308943917950398466?s=20"&gt;see their faces&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes having to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JaniceWyattRoss/status/1364032597484056577"&gt;resort to extreme measures&lt;/a&gt; to get the software to recognize them. This could potentially cause the students problems: Proctorio will flag &lt;a href="https://blog.proctorio.com/why-proctorio-does-not-use-facial-recognition/"&gt;them to instructors&lt;/a&gt; if it doesn't detect their face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iDk74f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The software failed to recognize black faces more than half the time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCBHT8"&gt;After anecdotally hearing about these issues, Akash Satheesan decided to look into the facial detection methods that the software was using. &lt;a href="https://proctor.ninja/the-duality-of-obfuscation-feat"&gt;He discovered that it looked and performed identically to OpenCV&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source computer vision program that can be used to recognize faces (which has &lt;a href="https://algorithmia.com/blog/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-software"&gt;had issues with racial bias in the past&lt;/a&gt;). After learning this, he ran tests using OpenCV and a data set designed to validate how well machine vision algorithms deal with diverse faces. &lt;a href="https://proctor.ninja/proctorios-facial-recognition-is-racist"&gt;According to his second blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the results were not good. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPy23_bKbLHttQtw6J1_i9V5Plk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430728/sjuwg8t.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results testing the software Proctorio relies on were not good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wSbt5L"&gt;Not only did the software fail to recognize black faces more than half the time, it wasn’t particularly good at recognizing faces of any ethnicity — the highest hit rate was under 75 percent. In its report, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; contacted a security researcher, who was able to validate both Satheesan’s results and analysis. Proctorio itself also confirms that it uses OpenCV &lt;a href="https://proctorio.com/licenses"&gt;on its licenses page&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn't go into detail about how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHGuGe"&gt;In a statement to Motherboard, a Proctorio spokesperson said that Satheesan’s tests prove that the software only looks to detect faces, not &lt;a href="https://blog.proctorio.com/why-proctorio-does-not-use-facial-recognition/"&gt;recognize the identities associated with them&lt;/a&gt;. Well that may be a (small) comfort for students &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7wxvd/students-are-rebelling-against-eye-tracking-exam-surveillance-tools"&gt;who may rightly be worried about privacy issues&lt;/a&gt; related to proctoring software, it doesn't address the accusations of racial bias at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R51cYl"&gt;This isn’t the first time Proctorio has been called out for failing to recognize diverse faces: the issues that it caused students of color were &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/02/01/u-illinois-says-goodbye-proctorio"&gt;cited by one university&lt;/a&gt; as a reason why it  would not renew its contract with the company. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) even &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/senator-more-transparency-is-needed-by-exam-proctoring-tech-firms/"&gt;called out the company&lt;/a&gt; when talking about bias in proctoring software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laDlFp"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v8mx/coded-bias-netflix-documentary-ai-ethics-surveil"&gt;racial bias in code is nothing new&lt;/a&gt;, it’s especially distressing to see it affecting students who are just trying to do their school work, especially in a year where remote learning is the only option available to some. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another 500 million accounts have leaked online, and LinkedIn’s in the hot seat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Multinational Companies Based In Dublin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_bCNDv2blJTC-LlWn845rVL5Els=/0x0:5991x3994/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098647/1230866122.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGeGCY"&gt;You might still be reeling from the news that personal information from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;533 million Facebook accounts&lt;/a&gt; has been made freely available online. But now there’s &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; huge batch of people’s data floating around the web — including data from LinkedIn, the Microsoft-owned social network confirmed. And the potential scope of the leak is huge: an individual selling the data on a hacker forum claims it was scraped from&lt;em&gt; 500 million&lt;/em&gt; LinkedIn profiles, &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/news/stolen-data-of-500-million-linkedin-users-being-sold-online-2-million-leaked-as-proof-2/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CyberNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6uidu"&gt;In a purported sample of two million of the profiles for sale, LinkedIn members’ full names, email addresses, phone numbers, genders, and more were visible, &lt;em&gt;CyberNews&lt;/em&gt; found. LinkedIn, however, says the data includes information from many places and wasn’t all scraped from the professional-focused social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GLmhG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No private member account data from LinkedIn was included”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7q3K79"&gt;“We have investigated an alleged set of LinkedIn data that has been posted for sale and have determined that it is actually an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies,” reads &lt;a href="https://news.linkedin.com/2021/april/an-update-from-linkedin"&gt;LinkedIn’s statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2aKnH"&gt;The company also contends that “no private member account data from LinkedIn was included” — which perhaps means the scraped data only includes information you’d be able to see on someone’s public page. LinkedIn insists that this was “not a LinkedIn data breach,” which would be technically true if the data was scraped rather than collected by a hacker penetrating LinkedIn’s systems, but doesn’t do much for users whose data is now being sold on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oQHcg"&gt;LinkedIn has yet to tell us if it will notify users whose data was in the dataset. (Facebook, if you were wondering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372707/facebook-responds-533-million-data-leak-notify-users"&gt;doesn’t plan to inform users if they are one of the people whose data leaked.&lt;/a&gt;) If you want to check whether your email or phone number was part of the Facebook data leak, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22367727/facebook-data-breach-haveibeenpwned"&gt;we have instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfxknv"&gt;Italy’s privacy watchdog has started an investigation into LinkedIn, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/linkedin-faces-italian-probe-after-users-data-is-hacked?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This webcam dares to ask: what if the panopticon had flesh?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A hunk of synthetic flesh with an eyeball and eyebrow, plopped on top of a screen where a webcam would go. The eye is looking to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7HevQQW77JOwYuh08Jho02o4Eo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098537/sidelook.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh boy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Marc Teyssier&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZczeC"&gt;Many digital eyes and ears are on us as we move about our daily lives. Surveillance cameras watch us on the street and smart devices listen for us in our homes. What if some of that watching happened through an expressive simulacrum of a human eye?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3PCO6"&gt;Researcher Marc Teyssier took it upon himself to craft such a device, giving a webcam synthetic flesh and a moving eyeball, complete with brow and lashes. Observe: the Eyecam. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A person’s hand tenderly holding a chunk of synthetic flesh with an eyeball in it glancing to the right. There’s a cord coming from the back of it. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8aoPK0OIUIj-_Ws2XHqk5i7IsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430730/hold2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marc Teyssier&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EtwaJR"&gt;You can see it in action – blinking, glancing, emoting – in the video below, which also commands us to use our imaginations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6NyqA8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Eyecam waking up on its own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrfmUS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Eyecam observing every one of your steps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGIhjI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine Eyecam always being there ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nfL3o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;... even when you don’t want it to be there!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZtU2e"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMxr8Nq-w_w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GRAqLq"&gt;If you can get past the uncanny valley creepiness, it is a neat device. Watching the people in the video carry it around in their palms makes it look almost cute. And the project, part of research at the Saarland University &lt;a href="https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/"&gt;Human-Computer Interaction Lab&lt;/a&gt;, does explore interesting questions. How would we interact with our devices if they were more human? How would our behaviors change if the surveillance around us felt that much more tangible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXCKLJ"&gt;If you’d like to make a watchful companion of your own, the Eyecam’s design and software are &lt;a href="https://marcteys.github.io/eyecam/"&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt;, and Teyssier promises a full step-by-step build video is in the works. More details are available at &lt;a href="https://marcteyssier.com/projects/eyecam/"&gt;Teyssier’s website&lt;/a&gt;, along with a plethora of images at each stage of the build process. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pieces of hardware and circuitry assembled in a square, at the bottom is what looks like plastic eyelids on hinges.

    <title>Avengers Campus is finally opening at Disneyland on June 4th, complete with aerial Spider-Man robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knTDzCrd1f05Oa45L8q7Yo5BVT0=/183x0:1659x984/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098528/disney_avengers.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An artist’s rendering of the new Avengers headquarters at Disney California Adventure | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/entertainment/disney-california-adventure/avengers-headquarters/" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RpnPJr"&gt;After being delayed for almost a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Avengers Campus will finally open at Disneyland, specifically at the Disney’s California Adventure park in Anaheim, California on June 4th, &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/04/avengers-campus-at-disneyland-resort-set-to-open-and-recruit-super-heroes-june-4/"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/avengers-campus-will-open-at-disneyland-on-june-4th.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQRfJW"&gt;The new area will bring Marvel Cinematic Universe characters into the physical space. CNBC reported the Avengers Campus will include character meet-and-greets with Thor, Black Panther, Black Widow, and other MCU heroes (and villains). It’ll feature &lt;a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disney-california-adventure/web-slingers-spider-man-adventure/?CMP=ILC-DPFY21Q3wo0408210414210003C"&gt;a new Spider-Man ride&lt;/a&gt; as well as the existing &lt;a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disney-california-adventure/guardians-galaxy-mission-breakout/?CMP=ILC-DPFY21Q3wo0408210414210004C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; rescue mission&lt;/a&gt; — plus the debut of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120300/marvel-spider-man-disneyland-california-avengers-campus"&gt;flying Spider-Man stunt double robot &lt;/a&gt;the company has been teasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17517512/disney-robot-stunt-double-animatronic-superhero"&gt;for years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wIx77G"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jycw3iiQN2w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="61Kkvn"&gt;Here’s the company’s extremely brief video tour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FpCnNY"&gt;“We’ve got the ultimate playground for Marvel,” Disney Parks chairman Josh D’Amaro told &lt;em&gt;CNBC.&lt;/em&gt; “As quickly as Kevin [Feige] and that Marvel team can create characters and create stories, we can integrate them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndyJwM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336234/disneyland-reopen-date-california-residents-only"&gt;Disney’s parks in Anaheim will reopen April 30th&lt;/a&gt; to California residents only. The lengthy park closures have hit Disney’s financials hard; the company &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disneyland-to-furlough-more-employees-including-executives"&gt;laid off thousands&lt;/a&gt; of park employees, and in its most recent fiscal quarter, revenue for Disney’s parks division revenue was down 53 percent, to $3.6 billion, the &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2021/02/q1-fy21-earnings.pdf"&gt;company reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company told investors during a February call that it estimated “the total net adverse impact of COVID-19 on segment operating income in the quarter was approximately $2.6 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike and MSCHF settle Satan Shoe lawsuit, say any ‘confused’ buyers can get a refund</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSCHF / Lil Nas X “Satan Shoes”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nmWBkGg5Y1gJSxAQ4Vs75rcXtiY=/64x0:1984x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69098340/Exbfpl2WgAAQkl8_resized.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: MSCHF&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPs4wV"&gt;Nike and the internet collective MSCHF have settled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;their trademark dispute&lt;/a&gt; over a run of unofficially modified Satan-themed Nike sneakers. Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal. But it apparently includes an offer to let customers return their $1,018 “Satan Shoes” — or a pair of MSCHF’s earlier “Jesus Shoes” — for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PseK3I"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, MSCHF’s attorneys said they were “pleased” with the settlement over the shoes, which were designed in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X. “With these Satan Shoes — which sold out in less than a minute — MSCHF intended to comment on the absurdity of the collaboration culture practiced by some brands, and about the perniciousness of intolerance,” the attorneys said. They said that the artistic message was also “powerfully” communicated by Lil Nas X’s song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” and “dramatically amplified” by Nike’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iLFQM"&gt;“Having already achieved its artistic purpose, MSCHF recognized that settlement was the best way to allow it to put this lawsuit behind it so that it could dedicate its time to new artistic and expressive projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fpm0hP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MSCHF says it’s ‘achieved its artistic purpose’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FuYn1c"&gt;Nike confirmed the settlement in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “MSCHF altered these shoes without Nike’s authorization,” the company said. “As part of the settlement, Nike has asked MSCHF, and MSCHF has agreed, to initiate a voluntary recall to buy back any Satan Shoes and Jesus Shoes for their original retail prices, in order to remove them from circulation. If any purchasers were confused, or if they otherwise want to return their shoes, they may do so for a full refund. Purchasers who choose not to return their shoes and later encounter a product issue, defect, or health concern should contact MSCHF, not Nike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="touzcf"&gt;It’s unclear how many — if any — buyers will return a pair of limited edition shoes whose value has likely been increased by a major publicity campaign around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EavPzk"&gt;Nike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;sued MSCHF over the Satan Shoes&lt;/a&gt; last week, saying the sneakers — which MSCHF embellished with ink, custom stitching, a pentagram charm, and (allegedly) a drop of blood — had tricked buyers and the public into believing Nike was “endorsing satanism.” MSCHF &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361961/mschf-nike-unauthorized-satan-shoe-lawsuit-response-restraining-order"&gt;countered by calling&lt;/a&gt; the shoes a protected artistic commentary on “extreme collab culture,” and it said all but one of the 666 Satan Shoe pairs had already been shipped, with the final slated for a giveaway to Lil Nas X fans. However, Nike won the first round of a court battle, with a judge granting a temporary restraining order against MSCHF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wNfsb"&gt;The Satan Shoes case could have set a precedent for how courts treat “upcycled” and heavily modified designer products. But a quiet resolution makes sense for Nike, which was apparently motivated by adverse publicity and potential damage to its reputation. (It did not file a similar suit when the Jesus Shoes were released in 2019, although it said last week that they also infringed its trademark.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkDYxQ"&gt;Meanwhile, MSCHF will apparently retain ownership of that final pair. “I can say that MSCHF intends to keep the last of the 666 shoes; regrettably, it will not be able to have Lil Nas X give that shoe away, as he was planning to do,” MSCHF’s attorneys said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wz0tme"&gt;Facebook and Instagram were down on Thursday afternoon. The outage appeared to start around 5:30PM ET, with several thousand people &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/"&gt;reporting outages&lt;/a&gt; on DownDetector. The outage is the second one in less than a month from the social media giant; an outage on March 19th took its sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340405/instagram-whatsapp-facebook-messenger-down-outage"&gt;offline for several hours&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook returned a “sorry something went wrong” error message:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTq9ijhz8IEIlwKkaVsxK-QcP1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430835/image__5_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dySLEl"&gt;The company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the cause of the outage; it’s unclear at this time when service will be fully restored. The outage appeared to affect Facebook’s internal websites as well, first noted in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1380274375757242368"&gt;tweet from develope&lt;/a&gt;r Jane Wong. Even Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/status/dashboard/"&gt;outage dashboard&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be having problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdjHJs"&gt;Shortly after 6PM ET, Facebook and Instagram appeared to be coming back for most users, but Facebook’s status page never changed to reflect the outage while it was occurring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifxQcS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE April 8th 6:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds that Facebook and Instagram have appeared to recover from the outage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
