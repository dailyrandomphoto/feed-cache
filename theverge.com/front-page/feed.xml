    <title>Zillow is moving out of the home-selling business </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Zillow Application Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_JbM13RHCqAp8tDFnV50xB8QKxw=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081459/1232667514.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C9xC1Q"&gt;Zillow has announced that it’s winding down the Zillows Offers program, a day after reports surfaced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758176/zillow-offers-ibuyer-housing-market-inventory-investors-real-estate"&gt;it’s selling over 7,000 of the houses&lt;/a&gt; it purchased with the intent of flipping them to would-be home buyers. In &lt;a href="https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Zillow-Group-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results--Shares-Plan-to-Wind-Down-Zillow-Offers-Operations/default.aspx"&gt;a press release announcing its Q3 results&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that Zillow Offers only served “a small portion” of its customers and that the company had “determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what [it] anticipated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA4uDM"&gt;With the program shutting down, the company says it’s reducing the estimated value of the houses it’s purchased in Q3 or will purchase in Q4 by more than $500 million. Zillow also says that winding down the business in the coming months will mean having to let go of almost 25 percent of its employees — almost 2,000 workers, &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/zillow-shutter-home-buying-business-lay-off-2k-employees-big-real-estate-bet-falters"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rkaW8G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just months ago, Zillow was touting Offers as a growing part of its business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gqfBm8"&gt;In August, Zillow’s &lt;a href="https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Zillow-Group-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;Q2 financial documents&lt;/a&gt; told a very different story — the company said that Offers was a particularly notable part of its business and that it had even secured &lt;a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/723050407/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Zillow-Q2'21-Shareholder-Letter_Exhibit-99.3.pdf"&gt;a loan for around $450 million&lt;/a&gt; to “continue funding [its] Zillow Offers growth.” It also touted its mass acquisition of homes as proof that its “pricing models and automation” for making offers was good for people selling their houses. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ymxz/zillow-other-tech-firms-are-in-an-arms-race-to-buy-up-american-homes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that there was an “arms race” between tech companies to scoop up real estate to sell to home hopefuls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NoQwM"&gt;Despite Zillow’s enthusiasm, what benefited sellers didn’t necessarily help out the company.  &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/zillow-shuts-down-home-flipping-business-after-racking-up-losses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company lost over $380 million on its Homes division, which ran Zillow Offers. In its Q3 shareholder letter, the company said that trying to grow Offers at the scale it hoped would be “risky” and said that it’d provided “too little opportunity for return on equity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OXi2iT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zillow Offers had problems under the surface&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyILzf"&gt;There were signs that the program was in trouble — a report on Monday said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758176/zillow-offers-ibuyer-housing-market-inventory-investors-real-estate"&gt;Zillow was looking to offload over 7,000 homes&lt;/a&gt; it had bought, not to individual buyers but investors. In October, &lt;a href="https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/At-Operational-Capacity-Zillow-Offers-to-Focus-on-Signed-Customer-Contracts-and-Current-Inventory-Suspends-Signing-of-New-Contracts-Through-2021/default.aspx"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was going to stop buying houses, citing labor shortages as the reason for its excess inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWqDOr"&gt;Zillow says in its press release and shareholders letter that it plans on focusing on its “core business” of providing a place to browse houses for sale and provide pricing estimates. It even goes as far as saying that its Offers program disappointed 90 percent of the people who didn’t end up selling their homes to the company, possibly hurting that core business by turning people who were in the market off from Zillow. The company doesn’t provide details on how it disappointed those potential sellers when it was offering what it calls a “fair market price.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV delayed again with no release date in sight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RjV5pbQLDez7uCr_h66RGeBUSXY=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081457/ow2__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SXs6pD"&gt;During Activision Blizzard’s third-quarter earnings call, the publisher announced that &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; will now launch later than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHUhAh"&gt;“As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain key creative roles, it has become apparent that some of the Blizzard content planned for next year will benefit from more development time to reach its full potential,” a Blizzard executive said during the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKxxtr"&gt;Activision Blizzard mentioned “higher voluntary turnover” and “the departure of a number of individuals across the company” as factors contributing to this new delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvNEM6"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment suffered a large number of firings and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;high-profile departures&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV &lt;/em&gt;game director Luis Barriga&lt;/a&gt;, after news broke of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;multiple lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; alleging sexual harassment, assault, discrimination, and unfair labor practices. &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394116/overwatch-director-jeff-kaplan-activision-blizzard-departure"&gt;lost its director Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; right before the lawsuits were publicized. These departures have apparently affected Blizzard’s ability to develop and release these highly anticipated games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBoDyD"&gt;While neither &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267131/diablo-4-overwatch-2-release-date-2022-activision-blizzard-earnings"&gt;had concrete release dates&lt;/a&gt;, the company strongly hinted at a 2022 release window. Now it seems both games will likely not release until 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9ch7c"&gt;“While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; than originally envisaged,” Activision Blizzard said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIYn10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnMfzf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard co-lead Jen Oneal steps down three months after taking the role</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sl7X4i1s2cscVNksmyL0vvxWQrY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081433/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AmGx2R"&gt;Jen Oneal is stepping down as a co-lead of Blizzard just three months after taking the role in the wake of the sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Activision Blizzard by the state of California. Mike Ybarra, a former Xbox executive who had stepped into the co-lead role alongside Oneal, will now be the sole lead of the studio, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aT4QdM"&gt;“I want you to hear from me personally that I have made the decision to step away from co-leading Blizzard Entertainment and will transition to a new position before departing ABK at the end of the year,” Oneal said in a &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23738005/a-message-from-jen-oneal"&gt;statement on Blizzard’s website&lt;/a&gt;. “I am doing this not because I am without hope for Blizzard, quite the opposite — I’m inspired by the passion of everyone here, working towards meaningful, lasting change with their whole hearts. This energy has inspired me to step out and explore how I can do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uZ7oHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m inspired by the passion of everyone here, working towards meaningful, lasting change with their whole hearts.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw0Cts"&gt;Blizzard will be making a $1 million grant to &lt;a href="https://www.getwigi.com/"&gt;Women in Games International&lt;/a&gt;, where Oneal is a board member. Before she fully leaves Activision Blizzard, Oneal will work to “determine the first steps around how the grant will be utilized, and its structure,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjKUdr"&gt;Activision Blizzard has undergone significant changes since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the lawsuit was filed in July&lt;/a&gt;. Former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt; (who Ybarra and Oneal replaced) and former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;head of global human resources Jesse Meschuck&lt;/a&gt; left the company in early August. The company’s chief legal officer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686183/blizzard-chief-legal-officer-leaves"&gt;departed in September&lt;/a&gt;. And Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick took a massive pay cut and ended forced arbitration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0nW3E"&gt;In addition to staffing changes, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746780/blizzard-blizzcon-harassment-cancel-warcraft-overwatch-blizzconline"&gt;paused plans for BlizzConline 2021&lt;/a&gt; and made changes to its games to remove references to problematic characters or themes. Blizzard changed the name of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740836/blizzard-overwatch-jesse-mccree-name-change-cole-cassidy"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, who was named after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;former lead designer&lt;/a&gt;, and vowed to remove “references that are not appropriate for our world” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjmkqy"&gt;Activision Blizzard also announced Tuesday that &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo 4&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760118/activision-blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-and-diablo-4-again"&gt;have been delayed again&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you haven’t gotten a Switch N64 controller yet, you’ll have to wait until next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-ulPySXjLcbtlP8tjvL-mFaGWU=/0x20:1194x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081235/114294_switch_nso_n64_controller_lifestyle_2000x2000.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch N64 controller.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v0r6ZG"&gt;The special Nintendo 64 controller for the Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1455558201416425473"&gt;briefly went on sale again&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, but if you missed buying one before they sold out, you won’t get a chance to pick one up until 2022, &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html"&gt;according to the controller’s listing&lt;/a&gt; on Nintendo’s website. We don’t know exactly when it will be back in stock, as all Nintendo says is that “more controllers will be available in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W5nqlwcW-bZABn2A0ZbsKdLXeHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980526/Screen_Shot_2021_11_02_at_1.44.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switch N64 controllers are out of stock until 2022. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1MnZo"&gt;The Nintendo 64 controller was released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728144/nintendo-64-sega-genesis-controllers-switch-online-expansion-pack-buy-order"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the availability of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&lt;/a&gt;, a premium Nintendo Switch Online tier that gives you access to Nintendo 64 games and Sega Genesis games. You don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the controller to play Nintendo 64 titles on your Switch, but players have found that the button layouts for some games &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/n64-games-for-nintendo-switch-online-have-some-issues/1100-6497396/"&gt;don’t translate well&lt;/a&gt; to Joy-Con or the Switch Pro Controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mV0iJ"&gt;If you want to pick up a Nintendo 64 controller when they’re back in stock next year, make sure you’re a member of Nintendo Switch Online, as the controllers are only available to subscribers of the service. The Nintendo Switch Sega Genesis controllers &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/sega-genesis-control-pad.html"&gt;are currently in stock&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing, however, so you might want to pick one up so you can take a nostalgia trip while playing &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Gunstar Heroes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Googler who helped lead 2018 walkout will reportedly join the FTC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn4D1okjhjETHWi5LmoGt9C6e-4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70081183/acastro_180320_1777_cambridge_analytica_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3OFSSD"&gt;Former Google employee Meredith Whittaker could soon be working at the Federal Trade Commission as an AI policy advisor, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/former-google-activist-whittaker-expected-to-join-ftc-as-ai-adviser"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Whittaker may be best known for helping to organize a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;2018 walkout at Google&lt;/a&gt;, where 20,000 employees protested against how the company handled alleged sexual harassment, and for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20695964/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-leaves-company"&gt;leaving Google afterward&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512413/google-employees-walkout-organizers-retaliation-punishment"&gt;retaliated against her and other organizers&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the FTC seems to be in the process of hiring her to help shape regulations around AI and Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqcmYK"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, Whittaker hasn’t been officially appointed yet, as steps like running a background check aren’t complete. If she is hired, though, she’ll bring a good deal of experience — she worked at Google &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/onward-another-googlewalkout-goodbye-b733fa134a7d"&gt;from 2006 to 2019&lt;/a&gt; and has done work around AI ethics since leaving the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFaEuu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whittaker accused Google of only caring about the appearance of ethics debate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xQp8u1"&gt;Besides helping with the walkout, Whittaker also advocated for Google to stop building AI for the military and spoke out against its ethics reviews, saying that it only gave the “appearance of an inclusive debate, rather than seriously contending with the problems in the company.” Upon leaving the company, she said that it was “clear” that it wasn’t a place where she could work toward tech accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wsa4S"&gt;Whittaker has also dealt with difficulties in the public sphere — she worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/15/18309437/new-york-city-accountability-task-force-law-algorithm-transparency-automation"&gt;New York City’s algorithm task force&lt;/a&gt;, which was designed to make sure that the city’s automated systems were equitable and had appropriate oversight and transparency. When NYC ended up releasing the report, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974379/nyc-algorithm-task-force-report-de-blasio"&gt;she called the effort “a waste,”&lt;/a&gt; echoing concerns raised by other members that dissenting opinions weren’t taken seriously or included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XoNm1o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC has struggled to regulate Big Tech but now appears to be gearing up for a fight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nKc6uW"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; points out, though, there are signs that the FTC could be a more hospitable place for her ideas if she actually ends up working there. The regulator’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;new chair, Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, has said she wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690176/ftc-chair-lina-khan-focus-antitrust-consumer-amazon"&gt;focus attention on tech giants and antitrust&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;Amazon has even requested&lt;/a&gt; that she not be involved in cases involving the company because of her past statements about breaking it up. The current administration seems serious about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671880/biden-alvaro-bedoya-privacy-ftc-commissioner-facial-recognition"&gt;nominating experts to work at the agency&lt;/a&gt;, which has struggled to regulate Big Tech in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8O3CH"&gt;If the FTC is looking to bring on industry veterans like Whittaker, it could be a further sign that the agency is getting serious about regulating Big Tech. It could help give some say to people who have the technical knowledge and firsthand experience working at companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, or Meta, even if efforts to change things from within were largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are now available at Walmart (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIV5Tj6iVDIqYuSz-Hj4pHWRF4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075550/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WCirms"&gt;Walmart’s latest PS5 and Xbox Series X restocking event was back for a second day of console restocks at 4PM ET / 1PM PT, but it seems to be over now. Perhaps these near-holiday restocks will be happening with greater frequency than we expected, since Walmart did two consecutive events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAJ2nb"&gt;We expected to see Walmart’s new queueing system in action, which we saw for the first time during the November 1st restock. If you load one of these pages, you’ll get a place in line, and you can keep browsing Walmart’s site as a timer runs down to let you purchase a console, assuming there’s still stock left. However, that new queueing system wasn’t used for the November 2nd restock, for reasons unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wp20Qz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="grcrxs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gdCyAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LH4Kwf"&gt;The consoles may be the main course, but don’t forget to order some extra sides for when you have company over. Here are a few accessories to consider for both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lLE0CZ"&gt;For PlayStation&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Ford’s selling electric crate motors based on the one in the Mach-E</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wcqEAdVyAvHIw8XhvoY8bzgaPU=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080795/All_electric_Ford_F_100_Eluminator_concept_truck_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8AnfG"&gt;Ford has &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/02/all-electric-f-100-eluminator-concept.html"&gt;started selling&lt;/a&gt; an electric crate motor based on the one that powers the GT version of the Mustang Mach-E. The “Eluminator e-crate motor” makes 281 horsepower, 317 pound-feet of torque, and costs $3,900. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZXH8T"&gt;The motor is just the first in a series of EV building blocks Ford says it plans to sell, like battery systems, motor controllers, and inverters, all of which would make it easier to retrofit internal combustion engine vehicles with all-electric drivetrains. Right now, those types of conversions are still mostly limited to specialty shops and hobbyists who often cobble together parts from all sorts of random places in the supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J7fepr-zJu590NAW6x-TqIPptS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980204/Ford_Performance_Eluminator_electric_crate_motor_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oHLWgb"&gt;To promote the new motor, Ford built a one-off all-electric version of a 1978 F-100 pickup truck, which it brought to the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) trade show in Las Vegas. It’s an annual showcase for aftermarket suppliers and custom builders, but it’s increasingly become a place for automakers to tease some wild ideas in the electric vehicle space — like when Ford brought an all-electric Mustang with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20950148/ford-electric-mustang-manual-prototype-stick-shift-lithium-sema-2019"&gt;a six-speed manual gearbox&lt;/a&gt; to the show in 2019, two weeks before the debut of the Mach-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wFvJ1w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10842088"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7CQsFY"&gt;The electric F-100 has two of the e-crate motors for a total of 480 horsepower and 634 pound-feet of torque — the same as the top spec Mustang Mach-E GT Performance — all wrapped in classic Ford truck styling. The inside also borrows from the Mach-E, as the truck has the same 15-inch portrait touchscreen on the dashboard, as well as the same 10.2-inch driver display. The electric F-100 even has a front trunk under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUyyzR"&gt;It’s a gorgeous blend of old and new, and it’s too bad it’s a one-off. But as Ford follows through on its promise to bring more electric drivetrain components to market, it will open the door to more custom builds and retrofits in this same style. There’s already been plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20747528/electric-porsche-912-vintage-restoration-tesla-car-vehicle-ev"&gt;awesome creations despite the cost and effort currently required&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approaching&lt;/a&gt;, the best iPad deals of the year are just around the corner, yet we’re already starting to see some solid discounts for those who can’t wait to grab one now. Whether you’re after the new 2021 entry-level iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or the latest iPad Mini, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnYL1M"&gt;We, of course, will keep an eye out for more deals as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, however, so be sure to keep checking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mEJgRj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday deals: what time sales start at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model. The ones you can currently find in stock, such as at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJrISyuZP4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are full price. Without any significant discounts, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has 64GB of storage instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with 256GB of storage for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant is $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;We’ve previously seen Walmart discounting both Wi-Fi models of the new iPad by $30. Although at the moment they’re sold out, there’s a possibility we could see a similar discount again as we approach Black Friday. However, if you can’t wait until then, Best Buy is selling the Wi-Fi versions of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWvH7LMj0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB&lt;/a&gt; full-priced while taking $30 off of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt;. Both models come with free six-month subscriptions to Apple Music and Apple News Plus. Note these freebies are only available to new subscribers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as its previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs for its time. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s recent “California Streaming” event that starts at a higher price point of $499. Meanwhile, the base 64GB outgoing iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor now is on sale starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWn7uOMT5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$360 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; instead of its typical $400. We have previously seen the 64GB recently drop to $299, so it’s possible this price could only decrease on Black Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntoIEO"&gt;You can also buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWpBeCEve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB variant for $495&lt;/a&gt; instead of $550, which is around $150 cheaper if you compare the old and new models on equal footing when it comes to storage. This could be a great opportunity for anyone who needs more storage or prefers the classic home button, Touch ID, or a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fifth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; will also throw in six months free of Apple Music when you purchase the iPad Mini full-priced from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, however, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward for the most part, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in space grey and sky blue at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is also available for a $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with your choice of many colors marked down to $650 at checkout.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is discounted to $750 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB model is available for $900 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D1148110%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestIPadDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; in both color configurations. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,005, respectively. Best Buy will also throw in six-month Apple News Plus and Apple Music subscriptions for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Some similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. The 256GB model is $949 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,100 instead of $1,300 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,300 instead of $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Oculus Quest update will help to prevent accidental dog punching</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest Space Sense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0XTHzrnbPSrMaAm1a_d3BAFwGw=/0x0:1997x1331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080621/spacesenseoculus.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Watch out, kid. You’re in my guardian.” | Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdGNmX"&gt;Fresh off of Meta’s Connect 2021 keynote, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751009/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-oculus-quest-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; was announced for Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fa-smarter-guardian-android-phone-notifications-and-improved-voice-commands-in-latest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; the latest set of software feature updates arriving on Quest and Quest 2 headsets starting today. The biggest addition is Space Sense, a feature that goes a step beyond the passthrough guardian by showing you in real-time when your safe VR space has been intruded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro6HZe"&gt;It’s a practical update that aims to keep you safer, along with the other people and things in your home, too. Pets sometimes like to come over to you while a VR headset is on because it looks, to them, like you’re just standing or sitting there getting excited about something. The blog post over at Oculus’ site says that Space Sense can detect things like people, large pets (sorry to small pets), and other objects that might have found their way into your passthrough guardian zone. These things will be highlighted in your headset, “surrounded by a pink-ish glow,” says Oculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiimkF"&gt;This is a great addition. But, we’ve got to pour one out since this means that the days when you could get away with taking joke selfies next to people VR without them knowing are essentially over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus Quest" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6LzPFDkR15YNOnww5J3yVyBvcZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980016/249331924_868670680684986_2274825082054725571_n.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus Quest headsets can now display notifications from iPhones and Android phones&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9huSGS"&gt;Version 34 of Oculus’ software for the Quest platform adds a slew of new voice commands if you’re someone who prefers to navigate the interface with your voice instead of physical movement. Here’s &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/what-can-I-say-with-voice-commands?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=a-smarter-guardian-android-phone-notifications-and-improved-voice-commands-in-latest-oculus-software-update"&gt;the current list of commands&lt;/a&gt; supported. Oculus also added the option to view Android app notifications while in VR. It first added the option for iOS users in May 2021, letting you pipe in your iPhone’s notifications while in-headset. You’ll need to activate the feature within the Oculus app for your Android phone, then enable it within the app or in your headset’s interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l94Osf"&gt;Lastly, Oculus shared that developers will soon be able to publish mixed-reality apps and games that utilize its Passthrough API on both the Oculus Store and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262794/oculus-update-app-lab-vr-early-access-sideloading"&gt;App Lab&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is the non-curated fork of the Oculus Store that hosts experimental or in-progress titles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749567/facebook-presence-platform-oculus-quest-mixed-reality-api"&gt;Oculus provided more detail around it, along with its ambitious Presence Platform&lt;/a&gt;, during Connect 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fired #AppleToo organizer files labor charge against the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/INY46vctDvgoNd95OBIXuJkYgwM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70080565/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O0HhUg"&gt;Janneke Parrish, a leader of the #AppleToo movement, has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company, alleging the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;fired her in retaliation for organizing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubzf2D"&gt;Parrish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;created the #AppleToo platform&lt;/a&gt; to help colleagues air their concerns with Apple’s culture of “pervasive sexism” and pay equity, according to the complaint. Then, in October, she was fired, allegedly for failing to comply with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;workplace investigation into leaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9emqc"&gt;Parrish says the company terminated her based on “false and pretextual reasons” — namely because she “spoke up regarding her personal experiences regarding workplace concerns and helped give voice to her co-workers’ concerns in a workplace where such issues have been systematically siloed, suppressed, and unaddressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhM1VW"&gt;“It seems like all the tech companies are using the same playbook,” says labor attorney Laurie Burgess. “They get rid of outspoken organizers by asserting they are responsible for a leak without any proof or documentation that that person was indeed responsible. My client denies having leaked this information.” Burgess is also representing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22751847/netflix-employees-dave-chappelle-file-charges-nlrb"&gt;fired and suspended Netflix organizers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as prominent Google organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoiwGm"&gt;This is the seventh unfair labor practice charge that has been filed against Apple since August. Last month, former senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-ceo-s-anti-leak-edict-broke-the-law-ex-employee-alleges?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;accused Tim Cook of violating the National Labor Relations Act&lt;/a&gt; when he warned employees that “people who leak confidential information do not belong here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4auhi"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple software engineer, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;filed a complaint in September&lt;/a&gt; alleging the company stopped employees from engaging in protected activity when they tried to discuss their pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfGsTl"&gt;An employee on the AppleCare team, Apple’s version of customer service, filed a charge on September 28th alleging they were unlawfully fired. This charge has not been previously reported. The employee’s identity is not known at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa0mbe"&gt;The NLRB is currently investigating claims against the tech giant. If it finds they have merit, it can try to secure a settlement. The labor board can also issue its own complaint if settlement talks fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLmubA"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
