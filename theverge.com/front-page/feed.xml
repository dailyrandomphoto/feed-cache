    <title>Amazon’s new MMO delayed for the fourth time, but this time by just one month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5FWQt"&gt;Amazon Games has delayed &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming MMO, from August 31st to September 28th, the studio announced on Wednesday. The delay — the game’s fourth —  comes shortly after the end of &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/new-world-closed-beta"&gt;a closed beta&lt;/a&gt;, which wrapped up on August 3rd at 2:59AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2d0l2"&gt;The team will be “making some improvements” based on what players found in the beta, taking time to “smash bugs, improve stability, and polish the game,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playnewworld/status/1422969580394319877"&gt;according to a post on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cZDRe"&gt;“This was not an easy decision to make,” the team said. “We know this isn’t the first time we’ve changed our launch date in pursuit of quality, and that it can be disappointing to wait a bit longer. But we want to be sure we deliver you the highest quality game possible at launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4NwR4S"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AUG2BN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; was first set to release in &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/history-and-magic-collide-in-mmo-new-world-releasing-may-2020/"&gt;May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, then was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-04-09-amazon-delays-launch-of-mmo-new-world-to-august-due-to-coronavirus"&gt;delayed to August 25th, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;to spring 2021&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;to August 31st&lt;/a&gt;, and now the new September 28th date. And the game hasn’t been the only Amazon Games title with a bumpy history. Hero shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible &lt;/em&gt;went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20"&gt;from launch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;to closed beta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;to eventually being canceled&lt;/a&gt; across the span of a few months in 2020. &lt;em&gt;Breakaway&lt;/em&gt;, a competitive fantasy brawler, was announced in 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17187836/amazon-game-studios-breakaway-status-canceled"&gt;but was canceled in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;, a version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;to be played right on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and developed in partnership with Bandai Namco, was announced in May 2020 for a June 2020 release, but the game still isn’t out yet and isn’t listed on Amazon Games’ website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJafy3"&gt;Bandai Namco told me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440891/amazon-games-pac-man-live-studio-twitch-bandai-namco"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; “is not quite ready to launch yet” and that it was working to determine a release date. I happened to ask this week if there was any update, but the company said it still does not have any news to share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook can project your eyes onto a VR headset, and it’s exactly as uncanny as it sounds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook’s prototype for “reverse passthrough VR,” a system for creating the illusion of eye contact while wearing a VR headset." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16XI0TT2ThWtjkxYNUUxSN4J5W0=/96x0:1104x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679043/Reverse_passthrough_VR_hero_image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeYFOQ"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs wants to help people see your eyes while you’re in virtual reality — even if the results sit somewhere between mildly unsettling and nightmarish. Earlier this week, FRL released a paper &lt;a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/reverse-pass-through-vr/"&gt;on “reverse passthrough VR,”&lt;/a&gt; a recipe for making VR headsets less physically isolating. Researchers devised a method for translating your face onto the front of a headset, although they emphasize it’s still firmly experimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBzfou"&gt;“Passthrough VR” refers to a feature that displays a live video feed from a headset’s cameras, letting users see the real world while they’re still wearing the device. Facebook’s Oculus Quest platform, for instance, shows users a passthrough feed when they step outside their VR space’s boundaries. It’s useful for quickly dropping out of VR, and it can also enable a form of augmented reality by adding virtual objects to the camera feed. But as FRL notes, the people around a headset user can’t make eye contact, even if the wearer can see them perfectly. That’s awkward if bystanders are used to seeing their friend or co-worker’s uncovered face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra8cy"&gt;FRL scientist Nathan Matsuda decided to change this. &lt;a href="https://research.fb.com/blog/2021/08/display-systems-research-reverse-passthrough-vr/"&gt;A blog post explains&lt;/a&gt; that Matsuda started in 2019, when he mounted a 3D display onto an Oculus Rift S headset. The screen displayed a virtual rendering of his upper face, and custom-rigged eye-tracking cameras captured where Matsuda was looking, so his avatar’s eyes could point in the same direction. The result was basically Matsuda wearing a telepresence tablet showing a copy of his own face — which is arguably just as awkward but with a more intriguingly postmodern twist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="FRL scientist Nathan Matsuda wearing a custom Oculus Rift S headset fitted with a flat 3D display on the front, displaying his upper face." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q47OoHzgIORQKPH4-MjNX-SnyqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761139/Image_1_v2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prototype of Facebook’s reverse passthrough system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yaO5hF"&gt;According to the blog post, FRL chief scientist Michael Abrash — quite understandably — didn’t find the idea very practical. “My first reaction was that it was kind of a goofy idea, a novelty at best,” he notes. “But I don’t tell researchers what to do, because you don’t get innovation without freedom to try new things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmZzam"&gt;Matsuda ran with the concept, and over the next two years, he led a team in developing a svelter design. The team’s prototype headset — which it revealed ahead of next week’s SIGGRAPH conference — adds a stack of lenses and cameras to a standard VR headset display. The stereo cameras capture an image of the face and eyes inside the headset, and their motion is mapped onto a digital model of the face. Then, the image is projected onto an outward-facing light field display. That display creates the illusion of looking through the lenses of thick goggles and seeing a pair of eyes, although in reality you’re still seeing a real-time animated copy. If the wearer jumps back into full VR, the display can go blank to signal that they’re no longer engaging with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q1nCrA"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Facademics%2Fvideos%2F200861371993198%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="210" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8vlPDc"&gt;The result is a pair of octagonal goggles that would look right at home in a Terry Gilliam film. FRL used a simple rendering of a virtual face, but it also showed off the system with its more realistic Codec Avatars, as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oaJylV"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Facademics%2Fvideos%2F526686541937428%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DuI0sD"&gt;FRL acknowledges that the system’s individual components aren’t all revolutionary. HTC already has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323093/htc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price"&gt;face tracking add-on&lt;/a&gt; for its Vive Pro headsets; it maps movement onto an avatar inside VR, not an outward-facing screen, but the principle is similar. This week’s paper focuses on the potential of light field displays and the system’s opportunities for better in-person social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWBxUi"&gt;HoloLens-style projection glasses theoretically leave your face much clearer than passthrough displays — although a lot of those glasses have darkened lenses, and &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/facebook-reality-labs-research-reverse-passthrough-prototype/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Road to VR &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, projected light on clear lenses can also block your gaze. But as companies like Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;reportedly experiment with&lt;/a&gt; passthrough designs, Facebook’s new research shows that solid screen isn’t necessarily a barrier to eye contact... of a sort.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is getting its own exclusive podcasts, starting with Batman</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“Westworld” Comic Con Panel 2019" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31DF5gI0BTUb-rB5Uowcb7GR-YY=/0x183:3000x2183/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678957/1163281017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HyqVVO"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxPodcast080421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; team wants its app to not just be the place people find big movie premieres but podcasts, too. The company announced today that it’s planning to release its new Batman podcast, &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Audio Adventures&lt;/em&gt;, as an in-app exclusive, meaning it won’t make its way to other podcasting apps or be available through an RSS feed. The scripted show, which features Jeffrey Wright as Batman and Rosario Dawson as Batwoman, will premiere this fall, although no exact date was provided.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIxBQH"&gt;In a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Joshua Walker, chief strategy officer at HBO Max, says the decision to make &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Audio Adventures &lt;/em&gt;exclusive has to do with the show being a scripted original series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHtu5O"&gt;“For scripted originals our working theory now is that they should sit aside our other scripted original content exclusively within the HBO Max environment,” Walker says. “But because we’re early days on scripted original audio content we do look at this as something that we’ll learn from, and we’ll see how it develops over time as we go from here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynSKr6"&gt;The show won’t include ads and will be part of HBO Max subscribers’ included content. (It won’t cost extra to access the audio.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELFt34"&gt;Along with that news, HBO also announced other new, forthcoming podcasts including a scripted sequel to Issa Rae’s &lt;em&gt;Looking For Latoya&lt;/em&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;We Stay Looking&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a new &lt;em&gt;OC&lt;/em&gt; companion podcast called &lt;em&gt;Welcome to The OC, Bitches&lt;/em&gt;. Both of these will be available on HBO Max, with Walker declining to say definitively whether &lt;em&gt;Looking For LaToya&lt;/em&gt; would be an exclusive or not, given that it’s a scripted original show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEDfTG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s just unclear if anyone wants to listen to their podcasts on HBO Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2HejtD"&gt;HBO is trying to turn its app into a destination for audio, as well as video, but making HBO Max the only place for &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Audio Adventures &lt;/em&gt;is an interesting gamble. The app in its current form is clearly designed for video functionality, and right now, listening to a podcast in the app, like the &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; companion show, requires users to search for it manually — there’s no dedicated podcast landing page. Also, locking your phone shuts off the podcast, and when open, the video player just keeps a static image on-screen advertising the ability to listen to the show on other podcast apps. It’s clearly not a fully built-out podcast experience. The team says it plans to allow for locked phone listening at some point, but didn’t commit to a date when that rollout might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K02S4W"&gt;Still, the strategy behind the exclusivity decision appears to be trying to leverage valuable IP and star power to draw more people to the HBO Max app. It’s just unclear if anyone wants  to listen to their podcasts there, especially if the experience isn’t comparable to actual podcasting apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlm9bJ"&gt;At the same time, it’s easy to see why HBO wants to double down on audio. Its competitors, namely Netflix, have also become more invested in a more robust podcasting strategy. Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/netflix-hires-ex-apple-executive-to-lead-podcasting-operations?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;amp;cmpId=google&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; its first podcast executive, N’Jeri Eaton, previously of Apple Podcasts, last month and uses podcasting as a marketing tool to encourage more people to come to its video app and subscribe. The podcasts are available everywhere, though, presumably to reach people who aren’t already in the Netflix ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8boPKE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Tensor chip is only the first step toward truly great Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kF1UuJnxwutby5scYPamtJdFgFA=/139x0:1612x982/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678910/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_2.33.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xdqRED"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; is shaping up to be the company’s most ambitious smartphone in years, largely due to the new, custom-designed Tensor processor, which aims to catapult Google to the forefront of the smartphone market with the power of Google’s years of machine learning experience. And Google needs it: despite the popularity of Pixels in tech circles, its phones just aren’t popular sellers in the US, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/idc-google-outsells-oneplus-with-7-2-million-pixel-smartphones-in-2019/"&gt;barely moving the needle&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/"&gt;juggernauts like Samsung and Apple&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/"&gt;smaller players like Oppo or Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mA7qIw"&gt;Tensor is Google’s big bet, centered on the AI-boosting TPU that promises to improve photos and videos, search, captioning, text-to-speech, and more. It’s a tall order for any chip, much less one focused mainly on machine learning as its standout feature — but while the Tensor SoC might not launch Google to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone-like heights&lt;/a&gt; just yet, it could be a crucial first step toward turning its Android also-ran into a top contender. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYkC6nm2kiiK0khVjc2DFmxtpp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755114/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd2z5X"&gt;The rest of the SoC is a mystery right now, but it seems like Google will be using third-party designs for things like the CPU, GPU, and modem — meaning that the Pixel 6 will probably feel pretty similar to any other Android smartphone powered by a Qualcomm or Samsung processor for most tasks, instead of some sort of revolutionary upgrade on par with Apple’s A-series powered iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA8xlO"&gt;Google hasn’t given a lot of information about what Tensor’s actual architecture is going to look like for things like the CPU, GPU, modem, or other major components of the SoC beyond the TPU. But based on rumors and the fact that Google isn’t taking the chance to crow about any major customization or advances its made here, it’s likely the case that most of Tensor’s hardware stack will be outsourced designs. Qualcomm and Samsung already do something similar — the Snapdragon 888 uses partially customized versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Arm’s Cortex-X1, A78, and A55 designs&lt;/a&gt;, while Samsung’s Exynos 2100 uses Arm designs for both its CPU and GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1HAgq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-custom-system-on-chip/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; more specifically that the Tensor will likely be some combination of Arm’s Cortex-A78, Cortex-A76, and Cortex-A55 CPU cores and Arm’s standard Mali GPU. Which means that the difference between Tensor and, say, a Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 might not be that major for things like overall CPU or GPU performance. That’s a good category to be in, especially if Google is trying to truly make a flagship device. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UU_zDtDmN0Whd2AQ5rBPEMEVMD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755092/Google_Pixel_6_Pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lzbxuU"&gt;But as Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Rick Osterloh told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “the standard stuff people look at will be very competitive and the AI stuff will be totally differentiated.” The things that make Tensor special and unique aren’t how fast it can run games or how efficient its CPU and battery life is, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaG97I"&gt;That means that Tensor probably also won’t be the magical solution that Android fans have been hoping for: a custom, Google-made chip designed specifically for Android and the Pixel’s hardware to deliver the kind of performance and power that Apple’s been able to offer on the iPhone for years using a similar strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oGrfrX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tensor is just a first-generation product&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AhJ9Zh"&gt;But the good news is that Tensor is just a first-generation product; it’s easy to point at Apple’s custom chips and demand that Google should do the same, but it’s important to remember that Apple’s earliest A-series iPhone chips started in a similar fashion. The A4 and A5 chips featured standard Arm designs for the CPU cores (with some optimization and improvements on top), before Apple switched to fully custom designs in later generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETJxiQ"&gt;Google is rumored to be working with Samsung, which will both be manufacturing the chips — which makes sense, given that it’s one of the only two companies, along with TSMC, currently fabricating 5nm chips (a service it provides for numerous companies, including Qualcomm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqReQH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-custom-system-on-chip/"&gt;Samsung is also rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be working more closely with Google on the actual design of the chips, too, leveraging its Exynos hardware and software in a capacity beyond simply manufacturing. We’ll have to wait until Google reveals more about Tensor to know the extent of that partnership, but it could mean that Google will get some extra help in more substantial custom chip improvements than if it had to reinvent the wheel from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wtqwru"&gt;The idea of a purpose-built machine learning chip in a Pixel phone isn’t a new idea for Google either. The company has put dedicated in-house AI chips in its phones before, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908071/google-pixel-4-xl-photos-video-hands-on-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Pixel Neural Core&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/5/16973286/google-pixel-visual-core-pixel-2-app"&gt;Pixel Visual Core&lt;/a&gt; in the Pixel 2, PIxel 3, and Pixel 4 models, making the Tensor less of a brand-new advancement and more a refinement of its past work. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Pixel 6 has two more fun color choices" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tt0ROElXG4wQo6XFI8EBRn2SZXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755096/Pixel_6_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="300iqP"&gt;Tensor’s TPU does seem to be the next step from that, presumably offering more powerful AI functionality than either of those two previous chips. It’s also more closely integrated with the phone, with Google noting that it’s able to do things like directly route image data through the TPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYy2aC"&gt;Those benefits may be worth the development of a custom SoC — again, we’ll have to wait and see how Google actually implements those AI features, and how substantial of an improvement they are over a standard Android flagship. (A sentiment that, in general, applies to how heavily Google is emphasizing the TPU as the major differentiator in the Pixel 6, something that feels like a tricky thing to actually sell customers on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xDRfM"&gt;As it stands now, though, the main difference between Tensor and a Snapdragon 888 looks like it’ll just be some fancy neural network tricks. But, much like with Apple’s early in-house chips, Tensor may just be the first step in a longer journey toward a more bespoke Google chip. And that’s a far more exciting concept than subtly better machine learning demos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s Star Wars hotel is just like Westworld: only for the wealthy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMftnanv7QExHesvfglzXqFP8lg=/216x0:1662x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678764/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_1.53.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzpfjR"&gt;Disney has been teasing its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/16/15729120/star-wars-immersive-hotel-westworld-disney-d23-expo-2017"&gt;Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel&lt;/a&gt; for years now, promising an almost &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;-style immersive experience (complete &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418959/disney-real-lightsaber-reveal-video-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel"&gt;with “real” lightsaber props&lt;/a&gt;) that will expand its Galaxy’s Edge theme park into a full-fledged two-day interactive &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; adventure. You’ll sleep in a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-themed room, eat and drink &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-inspired fare, and be surrounded by actors guiding you through your own &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; vacation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUF5IW"&gt;Today, the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fstar-wars-galactic-starcruiser%2Foverview%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609764%2Fdisney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a lot more information&lt;/a&gt; about the practical aspects of the Galactic Starcruiser experience, including a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fstar-wars-galactic-starcruiser%2Fplanning%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609764%2Fdisney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first look at pricing&lt;/a&gt; — and like the fictional &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt; theme park, it looks like Disney’s real world immersive Star Wars hotel will be limited to the extremely wealthy, with a two-night stay &lt;em&gt;starting&lt;/em&gt; at $4,809 for two adults. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GUrOwpecNSOiPtUSyUAznSBmxg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761342/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_10.07.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UawLiM"&gt;That price is just an estimate for an entry-level cabin, and things shake out differently depending on the number of guests in a group (a family of four with three adults and one child comes out to $5,999 for the two-night trip). The ticket includes two nights at the hotel, food and drink (except for “alcoholic and specialty beverages”), admission to Disney’s Hollywood Studios park for a day to visit the Galaxy’s Edge park, and parking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CexsAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See It. Feel It. Live It.  Get the details on Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, a 2-night adventure launching at Walt Disney World in Spring 2022.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Q4WaeIyX9L"&gt;https://t.co/Q4WaeIyX9L&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yqKLOzNHYE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yqKLOzNHYE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Walt Disney World (@WaltDisneyWorld) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WaltDisneyWorld/status/1422908040186114062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx5lWn"&gt;But you’re mostly paying for the immersive &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; experience, which Disney says will offer an in-universe style adventure, complete with roleplaying staff who’ll ask you for help on quests or factions that you’ll be able to join during your trip. Guests will even be allowed (and even encouraged) to dress the part in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; outfits (something that isn’t usually permitted at Disney parks for adult guests). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tpzl6J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s expensive, even by Disney resort standards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6F8Ol"&gt;There’s no way to look at Galactic Starcruiser as anything but an exorbitantly priced hotel, even by Disney standards. For comparison, a two-night stay during the same dates at the company’s Grand Floridian Resort — considered the most expensive and upscale option for staying at the park — along with two days’ worth of tickets at Disney parks for two adults comes to roughly $2,150 when booking directly through Disney, less than half the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fw8V0t"&gt;Obviously, that’s not a perfect comparison, given that Galactic Starcruiser is an all-inclusive stay that includes dining, but it’s clear that Disney is putting a &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt; premium on the immersive experiences that make Galactic Starcruiser unique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnrpyu"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fstar-wars-galactic-starcruiser%2Fexperience-highlights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609764%2Fdisney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sample itinerary&lt;/a&gt; from Disney includes activities like sabacc competitions, lightsaber training, and “unexpected” optional story moments that can pop up during a guest’s stay, which sound interesting enough. Half of one of the two days is dedicated to visiting Galaxy’s Edge and riding the two rides that have been open for months already, although guests will apparently be able to continue their storylines in the existing park from the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFT6VO"&gt;Maybe all that really is worth the incredibly high price of admission. Westworld sure looks popular on the TV show, too, and there are no lightsabers there. But right now, it looks like Disney has created what might be the ultimate &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; experience for fans, and priced it out of reach of all but the most wealthy of them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqOTAE"&gt;The highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bRFJnd"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle (8GB, ad-supported): $120 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$135&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lREHEL"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle (8GB, ad-supported): $170 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$190&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BR7xFN"&gt;Kindle Oasis Essentials Bundle (8GB, ad-supported): $290 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($&lt;s&gt;320&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZV2VTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is the usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for $110. If you buy either Kindle model, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids+ service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Although we’ve seen the Kindle Kids Edition drop to as low as $70 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $110, the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available for the Paperwhite, but you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon is currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $200&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s next-gen PSVR was reportedly detailed at a developer summit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MK7-fj1uqTuCkjNn3iKzrBibqco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678703/jbareham_160930_1240_0017_2016.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s original PSVR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="egGgRr"&gt;More and more details for Sony’s planned next-generation PlayStation virtual reality headset appear to be popping up. According to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnAOWbzBEco"&gt;YouTube channel PSVR Without Parole&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/ps5-vr-headset-hdr-oled-aaa"&gt;further corroboration from &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Sony held a developer summit on Tuesday where it detailed new information about the controllers and game development strategy for the sequel to the PSVR, and seemed to confirm some features that have already been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iZtIX"&gt;Among the new details, the next-gen PSVR controllers (or NGVR controllers, based on what PSVR Without Parole claims is the codename for the device) can reportedly not only detect when you’re holding the controller and touching buttons but also how far away your fingers are. The feature sounds a bit like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer"&gt;the radar detection that Google’s built into its phones&lt;/a&gt; and smart home devices in the past with the Soli chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VOOdPM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnAOWbzBEco?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NaQsCB"&gt;Sony also reportedly told developers it’s looking to pursue a hybrid model for future AAA releases on PlayStation. The goal being having optional VR support for all major releases, similar to what&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14369624/resident-evil-7-ps4-playstation-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18285578/no-mans-sky-vr-preview-sean-murray-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;received on the PS4 and PS5. As far as we know, a console is still required to use the PSVR, but if this plan is true, you could choose to play major AAA titles in VR or on your TV going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v3FZ4"&gt;Sony publicly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;announced the next-gen PSVR in February&lt;/a&gt; and detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;the features of its new controllers&lt;/a&gt; not long after. Taking into account the official information and what &lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;has reported as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429523/playstation-vr-ps5-rumors-eye-tracking-foviated-render-4k-screen-haptics"&gt;the possible specs for the device&lt;/a&gt;, here’s what we know about the next-gen PSVR so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hTK48h"&gt;The next-gen PSVR connects to PlayStation consoles through a single cable, no passthrough box necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ChiF4R"&gt;The headset features higher-resolution OLED displays that offer 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye (for a total 4K resolution) with an improved 110-degree field of view (10 degrees wider than the PSVR).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HvoTKq"&gt;Sony reportedly plans to use flexible scaling resolution in conjunction with foveated rendering enabled by eye tracking, to allow the device to only render what you’re actually looking at. The overall goal being to reduce the strain on the PSVR and PS5 and improve performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Itzae9"&gt;Sony will reportedly use inside-out tracking for the next-gen PSVR, and the company says the device’s controllers will have adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, touch-sensitive buttons, and reportedly the ability to sense the distance between your fingers and the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8FQ6z4"&gt;If all of these features bear out, it seems like Sony’s adopted a fair amount of the new VR standards popularized by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest and Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, and some of the more high-end features of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview"&gt;the Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172700/htc-vive-pro-eye-tracking-virtual-reality-headset-features-pricing-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;HTC Vive Pro&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536263/sony-playstation-vr-2-ps5-release-date-2022-samsung-oled"&gt;According to reporting from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Sony won’t actually launch the new PSVR until holiday 2022, but the company could finalize and announce more details later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3LjFE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colleges across the US and Canada are adopting virtual student IDs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ECONOMY-AUTO-MERCEDES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b43bWA5DvZJ0m9gyOtxGeql0tIk=/0x76:4463x3051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678528/695753658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The University of Alabama will be the first school to exclusively issue mobile student IDs this fall.&lt;/em&gt; | ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vC0XZi"&gt;Apple Wallet has supported contactless student IDs &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2018%2F10%2Fapple-adds-support-for-contactless-student-id-cards-in-wallet%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, with three US universities supporting the feature at launch. The program has been &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F08%2Fapple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gradually expanding&lt;/a&gt; ever since. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fstudent-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-expand-to-canada-and-more-us-universities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; that its virtual IDs will finally arrive in Canada this fall. An unspecified number of additional US universities will adopt it for the first time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO6K5Z"&gt;The University of New Brunswick and Sheridan College will be the first two Canadian schools to use Apple Wallet IDs. The new US roster includes Auburn, Northern Arizona University, University of Maine, and New Mexico State University, in addition to “many more colleges across the country.” &lt;a href="https://news.ua.edu/2021/04/old-swipe-action-cards-deactivating-this-summer/"&gt;The University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, one of the program’s early adopters, will also be the first school to issue exclusively mobile student IDs (to students with eligible devices) this fall. (Those with Android phones can use the digital cards through Google Pay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fl2DdY"&gt;Apple claims that “tens of thousands of college students” will have access to the feature during this upcoming school year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duke was one of the first universities to support virtual IDs in 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3KiTja"&gt;In theory, the virtual student ID should offer all the functionality of a regular student ID — holders can access restricted areas of campus or pay for amenities like food and laundry by placing their iPhone or Apple Watch near a physical reader. Transaction history isn’t shared with Apple or stored on Apple’s servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXmkxl"&gt;The new student ID format is part of Apple’s larger effort to expand Apple Wallet’s functionality. The app can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;store hotel room keys&lt;/a&gt; with the release of iOS 15 and will support driver’s licenses and state IDs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reconciliation could create a new kind of climate job</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bicameral Democrats Call For Civilian Climate Corps To Be Included In Reconciliation Process" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbAJ1wY-bjEqRVI8z9YKWVL-1jY=/0x34:6594x4430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678467/1329721258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks at a press conference urging the inclusion of the Civilian Climate Corps., a climate jobs program, in the budget reconciliation bill, outside of the U.S. Capitol on July 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. Ocasio-Cortez was joined by (L-R) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO), Joe Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and climate activists. | Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OZKWTb"&gt;If Democrats and progressives have their way, tens of thousands — or even millions — of Americans could soon find work planting urban trees, managing forests, and making homes more energy efficient and resilient to the ravages of climate change. They’d form a new “Civilian Climate Corps” that lawmakers and activists are hoping to fund through the budget reconciliation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ehubwh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The idea has picked up significant momentum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wYCzK"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/dems-agree-on-a-climate-corps-now-comes-the-hard-part/"&gt;more than a decade&lt;/a&gt;, different proposals have floated around for a new civilian mobilization focused on climate adaption. Recently, the idea has picked up significant momentum. The most ambitious proposal yet was introduced by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in April. Joe Biden proposed a more pared down Civilian Climate Corps as part of his American Jobs Plan in March, drawing on a range of previous proposals. Most recently, lawmakers have pushed for some form of the corps to be included in upcoming budget reconciliation negotiations, sending a &lt;a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/sites/kaptur.house.gov/files/Civilian%20Climate%20Corps%20Congressional%20Letter%20-%20Kaptur.pdf"&gt;joint letter&lt;/a&gt; to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgUaBx"&gt;The proposals differ in size and scope, but each would put people to work on federally funded projects that can minimize the toll climate change takes on the US. That might mean installing solar panels in Philadelphia, tending to sustainable urban farms in New York City, or building new career pathways for former coal communities in Appalachia. The Climate Corps would be overseen by a new body within the White House, and would also bolster the work of federal agencies like FEMA that already partner with other corps programs. And as the government establishes a new funding stream, the hope is that communities will find new projects and ways to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLe3Aj"&gt;There are already a range of nonprofit groups doing this work, and many are already looking to the Climate Corp proposals as a way to expand. “We’re ready to go,” says Julia Hillengas, executive director of one such program called PowerCorpsPHL. “There’s 130 plus corps across the country. There’s communities that are ripe and primed to start corps … they have all the pieces there, it’s just a matter of being able to get some of that seed funding to get things off the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yavEdA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re ready to go.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CIBxe2"&gt;The idea of a civilian environmental mobilization on New Deal-era concepts was launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to fight the Depression — particularly, the Civilian Conservation Corps launched in 1933, which provided job training and stipends to young men. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/08/01/fdr-cabinet-descendents-new-deal-biden-progressive-500659"&gt;Many in Biden’s staff&lt;/a&gt; have taken cues from Roosevelt as the current president looks to boost the economic recovery and prepare for future shocks from the climate crisis.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSER6A"&gt;Today’s corps programs generally serve two purposes: to accomplish some kind of public good, and to prepare its members for a particular vocation. In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members join “industry academies” focused on stormwater infrastructure, urban forestry, and solar energy. Since Hillengas co-founded the program in 2013, its members have planted more than 11,000 trees — an important &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573081/google-new-tool-hot-cities-trees-climate-change-temperature"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; for cooling down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;city neighborhoods that tend to be hotter&lt;/a&gt; than surrounding, greener areas. Many of their alumni move on to find related work afterward — members in the solar academy, for example, might find work installing or selling solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzIJrh"&gt;A similar program in New York City, called Green City Force, employs public housing residents who have built sustainable farms on public housing properties to provide organic, local produce to other residents. They also retrofit homes to make them more energy efficient, a vocation in which 65 percent of the program’s graduates have gone on to find employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members receive training on installing solar panels." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNx9Z9bAxEfxIM_scd1e2Vnd7pg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761167/solar_training.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members receive training on installing solar panels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pTBMK4"&gt;“What we hear from a lot of corps is this need for institutional support that is equitable and just and robustly funded, for making sure that they have the monetary resources to go out into the community to recruit folks, to give them the training they need, and to put them to work,” says Becca Ellison, deputy policy director at the nonprofit Evergreen Action. Evergreen, environmental activist group Sunrise Movement, and Democratic lawmakers are also asking that 50 percent of the funding and jobs for the Climate Corps go to environmental justice communities. Those are places that have been disproportionately burdened with pollution from industry, and that typically have more low-income residents and residents of color.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjZOGX"&gt;In the long term, advocates hope that climate mitigation and resiliency initiatives could also create new, green career paths for people who otherwise might have found work in coal, oil, or gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4uLg9"&gt;“We can kind of create this new world, this new Appalachia that has vibrant communities with good paying jobs,” says Béla Williams, a sixteen-year-old community organizer from southwest Virginia who joined the Appalachian Conservation Corps this summer. “I think a lot of communities can benefit greatly from opportunities like the Civilian Climate Corps, especially in places that have been ravaged by the coal industry or other extractive industries leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WvQ5G3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can kind of create this new world, this new Appalachia.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HsCuvV"&gt;Advocates are optimistic that the package will include some kind of Civilian Climate Corps — but the size of the program is still up for debate. The Biden administration proposed $10 billion to be doled out over a decade, which might be able to fund up to 20,000 jobs a year by some estimates. Markey, Ocasio-Cortez, and Sunrise Movement have asked for far more — $132 billion to hire 1.5 million Climate Corps members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqj0RD"&gt;“[Markey and Ocasio-Cortez’s] proposal, we believe will signify the beginning of the decade of the green New Deal because it would give millions of good jobs to people,” says Ellen Sciales, communications director for Sunrise Movement. They say the more expensive proposal will also ensure that corps members make at least $15 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjdGVC"&gt;Without that funding, participants may be stuck making less than a living wage. Current members of AmeriCorps-funded programs get paid a minimum stipend of $16,000 a year, although organizations like PowerCorpsPHL often try to raise funds to pay their members more. The hope is that, with economic stimulus still on the White House agenda, the federal government will be willing to put in the necessary funds to make the programs economically sustainable and make climate mitigation part of a sustainable career path for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wKkaG"&gt;“That’s money in young people’s pockets that they’re using to support their families,” Hillengas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh516W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author of this story was previously a member of Public Allies and Jumpstart, corps programs that are part of the AmeriCorps network. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dDzlk"&gt;Some Facebook users stymied by the company’s seemingly impenetrable support channels have turned to an interesting — and expensive — loophole to get access to their locked accounts: buying an Oculus Quest headset, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023801277/your-facebook-account-was-hacked-getting-help-may-take-weeks-or-299"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn’t appear to be a reliable way to get access, as many reports online indicate that the solution didn’t work out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm6Qzh"&gt;The crux of the issue is that it’s often difficult to know if Facebook is receiving support requests when you submit them through its normal channels. From &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jY5bX0"&gt;Facebook tells users to report hacked accounts through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacked"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. The site instructs them to upload a copy of a driver’s license or passport to prove their identities. But the people NPR spoke with said they had trouble with every step of this automated process and wish Facebook would offer a way to reach a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXB0Bi"&gt;“I sent these forms in morning, noon and night, multiple times a day,” [Jessie] Marsala said. “Nobody got back to me, not once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6VM9r2"&gt;Facebook says &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/155050237914643?helpref=faq_content"&gt;on its own support site&lt;/a&gt; that “we have fewer people available to review IDs because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic” and that reviews “may take longer than usual” as a result. And a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that “we also know that we need to keep improving in this area and plan to invest more in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZeyYz"&gt;The breakthrough, for some people, was a tip they found to buy a headset from Facebook-owned Oculus, which has its own customer support system, according to &lt;em&gt;NPR. NPR &lt;/em&gt;spoke with two people who successfully got access to their Facebook accounts after buying an Oculus. But we’ve found a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/on2ykq/buying_an_oculus_to_use_their_tech_support_to/h5psvmr/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/jc7ys6/oculus_support_can_not_help_you_with_facebook/g90tqaq/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/k66izc/facebook_account_issue/gejbaw8/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; indicating that Oculus support &lt;em&gt;hasn’t&lt;/em&gt; delivered a smoother support experience, so there’s no guarantee that it might work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb4prU"&gt;And even if you are thinking of buying an Oculus Quest 2 to try to get some support help, you can’t actually get one right now — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596076/facebook-oculus-quest-2-storage-upgrade-foam-face-mask-recall"&gt;Oculus has paused sales until August 24th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
