    <title>The Google Store is open again, and Pixel 6 delivery dates are all over the place</title>

  &lt;p id="DqywpW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;Pre-orders for Google’s new line of phones&lt;/a&gt; started at the same time as their launch event, but for most of us, trying to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has meant seeing nothing but error screens. Some unsteadiness is to be expected given the sudden demand, but at 1PM ET, the doors opened, and Google’s store seemed to fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGyn0z"&gt;As of 5:40PM ET, Google says the store is operational again, and many of us have been able to put orders through. According to a spokesperson, “The Google Store was temporarily down but is now back up. We apologize for the inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zzX7D"&gt;However, as &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/19/pixel-6-shipping-date-flux/#more-461552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, being able to submit an order is only part of it. Availability of different devices and projected delivery dates have continued to move around, with little consistency about what’s available and when it might show up at your front door. Some people are reporting delivery dates stretching into 2022 for the Pixel 6 Pro, while others have been able to secure orders scheduled to arrive in early November.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="feOHQ5"&gt;Since then, things have improved, but more than an hour later, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisPirillo/status/1450522739442262018"&gt;most of us&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1450527567593758721"&gt;only seeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1450507803504881666"&gt;one error code after another&lt;/a&gt;. If you can get through, you can select to use the new Pixel Pass or add on a 30W phone charger. The fast wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, however, says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmY7tH"&gt;A quick scan of social media revealed that some people were able to complete purchases for the new Pixel 6 in the first hour or two they were available. For the rest of us, at least we’ve had time to learn patience while searching for a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch OLED, RTX 3090, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X refrigerator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jyKvTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 19th, 5:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the store is functional again, and added a statement from a Google spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spec showdown: Google’s new Pixel 6 vs. Samsung, Apple, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3dW1tEyzjUOCkXkveTllSgei3S4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018000/cwelch_211015_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gqqDWH"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;its fall event on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, which feature its custom Tensor processor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;the first big camera upgrade for Google’s phones&lt;/a&gt; since the Pixel 3. Since the Pixel 6s are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder now&lt;/a&gt;, let’s take a look at how Google’s new phones compare on paper to their Android and iPhone competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8OO9p"&gt;At this point, how Google’s Tensor custom chip will perform is the biggest question mark — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; it’s comparable to the Snapdragon 888, but that’s not even Qualcomm’s most powerful chip today, and Qualcomm is &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;holding an event in November&lt;/a&gt;, potentially to show off &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;even newer chips&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, though, as we’re working on putting the Tensor through its paces to see how it performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhC82S"&gt;With that in mind, let’s see how the mid-range Pixel 6 compares to some of its competitors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TW6y6Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DtgE2c"&gt;Observant readers may have noticed that Samsung’s due to refresh its mainstream Galaxy S lineup in a few months. While that’s perhaps not a concern for someone looking to buy a phone &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, it’s something worth keeping in mind if you’re willing to wait a bit for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXPiol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung could bring the heat in a few months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S6XKUN"&gt;Today, though, the Pixel 6 is less expensive than its competitors and would physically tower over most of them. It’s actually bumping up against the &lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/em&gt; in terms of dimensions, which is great news if you like big phones — and not so great if you prefer more compact ones, like the original Pixel or iPhone Mini. While the Pixel 6’s battery is no slouch capacity-wise, it is a bit curious that Google didn’t choose to make it bigger. Though again — the phone starts at $599, so there’s only so much complaining you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFvWPR"&gt;Let’s move on from the mid-range phones and take a look at the higher-end offerings from Google, Apple, and Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3uzdo8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMP0f9"&gt;As with the regular Pixel 6, the Pro’s price does it a lot of favors, especially when many of its competitors are playing in the $1,000-and-up range. We’re also seeing Google join the megapixel race that’s been kicked off among Android phone manufacturers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;finally ditching the 12MP sensor that’s been featured on Pixels for so long&lt;/a&gt; (though we’ll have to test them out to see how the images actually look). The Pixel 6 Pro also has a top-tier amount of RAM for multi-taskers, and its battery is nothing to sneeze at either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of3Wgw"&gt;Overall, it’s a phone that checks a lot of the boxes for a flagship Android phone — it has mmWave 5G, a 120Hz 1440p display, and promising camera specs. As always, though, stay tuned for the full review to find out if the Pixel 6 Pro is equal to (or, dare I hope, better than) the sum of its parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnAUXB"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Pixel 6 and the Pro or are currently rocking a lower-end Pixel and are wondering if it’s time for an upgrade, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"&gt;check out our Pixel comparison article here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox will soon automatically mute your speakers when you plug in headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUwkVmkFKb8cr-7jjvFTV1nrT_s=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017902/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3eqym"&gt;Microsoft is testing a feature that automatically mutes your speakers when you plug in headphones, fixing one of my biggest pet peeves with playing games on Xbox. The feature is rolling out &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/19/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2111-211017-2200/"&gt;to Xbox Insiders on the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring&lt;/a&gt;, which means it will very likely be available more broadly in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AXc6F"&gt;Right now, when you plug in headphones to your controller on Xbox, your speakers stay on, too, which means if you want to have the audio just play in your headphones, you have to separately turn down the volume on your speakers. The PS5, on the other hand, handily mutes speaker audio when you plug in headphones, and I’m glad Microsoft is following suit by working on a similar feature for Xbox. The option to atuomatically mute speaker audio will appear in a revamped audio settings menu, according to Microsoft’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6qi7a"&gt;This new Skip-Ahead build also includes a new accessibility feature: color blind filters. “While some games implement similar filters individually, this new feature applies globally to everything on Xbox Series X / S, including all games, movies, apps, menus, etc.,” Microsoft said in its blog. “It also supports multiple forms of color blindness, and the filters can be adjusted to your preference without impacting performance, screenshots, or game clips.” The company first talked about this feature during its Xbox Accessibility Showcase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22702660/xbox-games-accessibility-feature-tags"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is shifting the way it ranks its most popular titles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/re4cATA64_ZbkC5VqIfaVWbx6ME=/563x0:3443x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017846/SquidGame_Season1_Episode1_00_44_44_16.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image from Netflix’s popular title &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8lJc8j"&gt;Netflix will change the public-facing metrics it uses to rank the most popular titles on its streaming service, the company announced Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PGuLq"&gt;In the past, the company has ranked titles based on the completion of at least the first two minutes of a film or TV show in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;first 28 days&lt;/a&gt; on the service. More recently, however, the company has released rankings based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;total number of hours&lt;/a&gt; a movie or series is viewed — a metric it will shift to moving forward beginning later this year, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FINAL-Q3-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzeZBK"&gt;“There is some difference in rankings [...] but we think engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction,” the company said. “It also matches how outside services measure TV viewing and gives proper credit to rewatching.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LULOSE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix says hours viewed “is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6jVCvu"&gt;The change will not only shift one of its key public ranking systems from viewers to hours viewed but should, in theory, make its rankings a little easier to understand. While the company does track things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924954/netflix-viewers-numbers-metrics-data-stranger-things-tuca-bertie-oa-renew-cancel"&gt;completion of its titles&lt;/a&gt; internally, the 2-minute metric was confusing and had the potential to misrepresent the true success of a series or film (for example, if an account holder watched &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the first two minutes but then bailed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gP94ea"&gt;Additionally, the company said, “we will start to release title metrics more regularly outside of our earnings report so our members and the industry can better measure success in the streaming world.” Transparency around streaming figures — and the accuracy with which services track their titles — has been called for by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611516/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-streaming-services-transparency"&gt;industry figures&lt;/a&gt; who say that streaming services aren’t forthright about success metrics, complicating everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22731087/hollywood-union-reaches-contract-agreement-iatse-avoids-strike"&gt;cast and crew payouts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;contract negotiations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAyd9acUZ4Xd6vaUg0dSgPLbqgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883359/Netflix_Code_Conference_V2.001_X3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Code 2021&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TlZlYg"&gt;Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;last month at CodeCon&lt;/a&gt; shared rankings of Netflix’s top titles based on both the 2-minute metric and the hours watched metric, and a side-by-side comparison showed that — while overlap was certainly visible — the different metrics changed the title rankings noticeably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlO68h"&gt;What’s certain is that by many of its metrics, its Korean drama &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; has been a massive success on the platform. Citing internal documents, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/squid-game-season-2-series-worth-900-million-to-netflix-so-far?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;Bloomberg reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that the company estimated “89% of people who started the show watched at least 75 minutes (more than one episode), and 66% of viewers, or 87 million people, have finished the series in the first 23 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFhrHL"&gt;Last week, the company announced the series had become its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;biggest ever series at launch&lt;/a&gt;. In its shareholders letter on Tuesday, the company revealed that a “mind-boggling” 142 million households globally had tuned into the show, based on its 2-minute metric. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How corrosive valves may have delayed the launch of Boeing’s Starliner</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 Prelaunch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7V4AX1V94hJ6eqCcUDo4SeWtRw=/0x0:4459x2973/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017823/1234402998.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boeing’s Starliner seen rolling out to its launchpad, ahead of the August delay&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by /NASA via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MuRDpK"&gt;Boeing says it is narrowing down the source of the issue that delayed the launch of its new Starliner spacecraft this summer, blaming the problem on excess water and humidity causing the vehicle’s valves to stick ahead of the flight. The company plans to extensively study the problematic valves over the months ahead and implement design changes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718002/boeing-starliner-test-flight-delayed-nasa-2022"&gt;with the hope of launching Starliner again in mid-2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYQrEh"&gt;Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner is a new passenger spacecraft, designed to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. Before Starliner can carry a crew, however, NASA wants Boeing to launch a successful flight of the vehicle without people on board, to prove the spacecraft can safely go through all the motions of a typical launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vp8KGb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boeing’s attempts to launch an uncrewed Starliner have hit quite a few speed bumps &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHU6rr"&gt;But Boeing’s attempts to launch an uncrewed Starliner have hit quite a few speed bumps along the way. The company launched the vehicle without a crew for the first time in December 2019, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;a series of software glitches&lt;/a&gt; prevented the spacecraft from reaching the right orbit needed to meet up with the International Space Station, and flight controllers had to bring the vehicle back earlier than planned. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing hoped to try again in early August 2021&lt;/a&gt;, by launching another empty Starliner. But just hours before liftoff, the company found that a number of Starliner’s valves, used to transport oxidizer — a critical propellant needed for the flight — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;weren’t in the right alignment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsYKCb"&gt;In an update today, Boeing officials said that 13 of the 24 oxidizer valves would not behave properly, sticking in the wrong position. While Starliner was still on the launchpad, Boeing was able to free up nine of the 13 sticky valves, but four stubbornly wouldn’t move correctly. That prompted Boeing to return Starliner back to the factory for a closer look. Since then, engineers have dissected three of the valves, which helped them figure out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner ahead of launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CnkJEN"&gt;“We were able to eliminate a number of those items such as wiring or bad instrumentation of giving a faulty reading,” Michelle Parker, vice president and chief engineer at Boeing, said during a press conference on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKpYrv"&gt;Ultimately, Boeing thinks that some of the oxidizer inside the valves actually escaped, leading to the stickiness. The valves are sealed with Teflon, and it’s known that oxidizer can sometimes permeate through Teflon material, according to the company. Boeing said Teflon is “chosen because it’s compatible with the oxidizer,” while other seal materials are not. The theory is that when the oxidizer escaped, it mingled with extra moisture and humidity at the launch site, causing the valves to slightly corrode. And this corrosion is why Boeing couldn’t get the valves to move as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjrSOW"&gt;Since the launch delay, Boeing says it has freed up 12 of the 13 stuck valves using a combination of extra heating and higher voltages. The Starliner team is keeping one valve stuck intentionally in the meantime, as they determine what kind of fixes they can put in place to ensure this doesn’t happen again. That might include the addition of extra heaters in the valves. Additionally, Boeing removed two of the valves and is sending them to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, where they’ll undergo CT scans for even more stringent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="USOKLw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This was one of those things that had to absolutely work, or else we would not fly.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k2i7T0"&gt;Perhaps most concerning is that Boeing still doesn’t understand why the problem didn’t present itself ahead of the flight. The company claims that engineers did plenty of testing on the valves before the vehicle was on the launchpad, and the equipment worked as expected. “We had no indication that there was going to be any problem with these valves,” John Vollmer, Boeing’s program manager for Starliner, said. Vollmer claims Boeing added oxidizer into Starliner 46 days ahead of the flight, but they expected to be able to add the liquid up to 60 days ahead of the mission without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQVGMi"&gt;If Boeing does fly Starliner in the middle of next year, the company hopes to fly the vehicle with its first passengers toward the end of 2022. “[Our objective] is to get back to flight safely — and I stress safely — as soon as possible,” Vollmer said. “So everything we’ve done up to this point, and the path that we’re developing going forward, is going to enable us to meet that goal and getting back to fly safely.” Meanwhile, NASA’s other Commercial Crew provider, SpaceX, has already begun regularly flying astronauts to and from the International Space Station, with another launch coming up on October 31st. When Starliner starts flying, the plan is for SpaceX to fly crews once a year and for Boeing to fly crews once a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvH5ci"&gt;When asked what would have happened if Starliner had launched with the sticky valves, Boeing said that such a scenario could never have occurred, because flight controllers must check the valves before flight. “This was one of those things that had to absolutely work, or else we would not fly,” Vollmer said. “So, this is not an issue of, if we had launched and not known this. We absolutely knew that these valves would be in the right position before launch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite adds some melange with new Dune crossover</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMij9QI8R2BYJPeQDOnhSwxLa9Y=/0x0:1532x1021/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017727/fortnite_dune_loading_screen_jpg_1920x1080_3581f4b9432f.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lo8Ia7"&gt;Epic Games is once again proving that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by adding two playable characters from &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; to its hit battle royale shooter. Starting Tuesday at 8PM ET, you’ll be able to buy &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/paul-atreides-and-chani-travel-from-planet-dune-to-the-fortnite-item-shop"&gt;virtual &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; avatars of Paul Atreides and Chani&lt;/a&gt; modeled after Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, the actors who play them in the upcoming movie. There are a handful of other &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;-themed items you can pick up as well, including an ornithopter glider and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KohxK0_agqg"&gt;Sand Walk emote&lt;/a&gt; that mimics how the characters walk to avoid detection by gigantic sandworms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8VhuX"&gt;The tie-up arrives just a few days before &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s premiere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551728/dune-movie-release-date-delayed-again-warner-bros"&gt;in theaters and on HBO Max on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. While it doesn’t seem as if sandworms will actually be making an appearance in the game (to my great disappointment), there’s plenty of new spooky stuff to check out during &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s newly announced Halloween event, which runs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733240/fortnite-fortnitemares-2021-halloween-event-ariana-grande"&gt;from Tuesday until November 2nd&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is ready to admit it was wrong about the future of laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m12jFAfSID_WEfiedS0EpLEa7mE=/1x0:1911x1273/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017538/Apple_MacBook_Pro_Ports_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports, ports, glorious ports.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hjCdN"&gt;There’s plenty to be excited about when it comes to Apple’s new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros. As well as souped-up Pro and Max versions of the already capable M1 chip that Apple debuted last year, they also include numerous quality of life improvements like the return of MagSafe, a row of function keys rather than an OLED Touch Bar, and of course, a full selection of ports that won’t have users reaching for a dongle if they just want to import some photos from an SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYTmsh"&gt;In fact, Apple was so enthusiastic about these “new” features, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that it was the one that killed most of them off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13490774/apple-macbook-pro-review-2016-13-inch-laptop"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CN7cuC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ecOgaI"&gt;“Users value the full-height function row on the standalone Magic Keyboard, and we’ve brought it to the MacBook Pro,” Apple’s Shruti Haldea said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/exM1uajp--A?t=1957"&gt;as she explained the decision to ditch the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;, the touchscreen OLED strip Apple so enthusiastically introduced five years ago. “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/exM1uajp--A?t=1989"&gt;Having a wide range of ports can make life a lot easier for pros&lt;/a&gt;,” Haldea continued, concisely summarizing what professional users have been saying for roughly half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZNF2i9fNRbLByiY1cLh5Kwg-9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939123/msedge_gtjccFwnty.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Mac product line manager Shruti Haldea introduces the new MacBook Pro — including a physical function row!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nxLP4M"&gt;MagSafe, the convenient magnetic charging connector, is also returning to laptops after Apple stopped including it on its laptops in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97eR2f"&gt;Although it’s obviously backtracking, I think Apple is absolutely making the right call with all three of these changes. For the vast majority of users, a proper function row is far more useful than a software-based Touch Bar that failed to catch on with developers; a bevy of easily accessible ports make life easier for Pros and average Joes alike, and MagSafe is faster to connect than a USB-C cable and can prevent your laptop from being damaged when someone trips on the power cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DwJg1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All three features feel like the right call&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pL4riF"&gt;But it’s hard to ignore the broader context of these improvements, which is that they effectively bring the company’s 2021 MacBook Pros back in line with the features they were already offering from 2012 to early 2016. Arguably, the primary reason these new MacBooks are being greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm now is that Apple made the wrong bet on where laptop design was headed back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RppqPt"&gt;The MacBook’s transition to USB-C arguably started with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;2015 13-inch MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, which included just two ports: one USB-C port to handle charging, display output, and connecting of any and all accessories and one 3.5mm headphone jack. But it was with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13436750/apple-macbook-pro-announced-laptop-price-release-date-specs"&gt;2016 refresh of the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s commitment to an exclusively USB-C laptop future became truly apparent. Rather than the collection of Thunderbolt, USB Type-A, HDMI, and SD card ports that previous models had included, the 2016 MacBook Pro lineup included a choice of either two or four USB Type-C / Thunderbolt ports, alongside a headphone jack. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/5/13523372/usb-c-macbook-adapter-donglelife-problems-thunderbolt"&gt;dongle era&lt;/a&gt; had begun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="macbook pro 2016" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8VEWSXvGr9NzOdoclpv_oiaLnzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7390289/vpavic_161031_1256_0096.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro, and its sadly necessary USB-C adaptors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rD7InI"&gt;Apple was one of the earliest adopters of what was, at the time, a very new connector. And going all-in on USB-C was basically unheard of. At the time, USB Type-A was still dominant on laptops and desktops, while Android manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/2/12344688/samsung-galaxy-note-7-announced-price-release-date-specs"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt; were only just starting to switch away from Micro USB in their flagship phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OSJjQ"&gt;Most people know what happened next: owners were forced to invest in adapters for all their old peripherals. Their laptop itself may have gotten slightly slimmer and lighter, but for pro use on the go, any space or weight saved in a backpack or briefcase was tempered by the added bulk and complexity of the extra accessories you needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z1fiCu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An end to adapters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHiVKJ"&gt;We all know what ended up happening, but I think an interesting question to ask is what Apple &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; was going to happen after it transitioned wholesale to USB-C. For what it’s worth, the company seemed, at the time, to have been genuinely caught off guard by the anger from users having to buy endless adaptors to connect basic accessories and, shortly after the release of its 2016 MacBook Pros, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13524272/apple-cutting-usb-c-adaptor-prices-macbook-pro"&gt;cut prices across swathes of its USB-C adapter lineup&lt;/a&gt; to help users “transition” to the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sgIaW"&gt;To me, this suggests Apple thought #DongleLife was going to be a temporary transitional phase rather than the new normal it eventually became. For an example of the kinds of accessories it thought would become commonplace in the future, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13440158/apple-event-lg-ultrafine-5k-displays"&gt;5K display from LG&lt;/a&gt; it announced onstage at the same event, which it said was designed to pair with the new MacBook Pro. The display used a single Thunderbolt 3 cable for video, power, and data and also acted as a USB hub, thanks to a trio of additional USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEP4cX8xXGWzaN321Mhlyhf2RTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938876/HKN62_AV5.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s 5K monitor, announced onstage alongside the MacBook Pro 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pshcOR"&gt;Had monitors like these quickly become commonplace, we would have ended up with a future where users could dispense with many of these bulky dongles and adaptors and have the convenience of plugging into a static desk setup with just a single cable. But while some monitors did, what generally happened was that monitors continued to ship with a mix of HDMI and DisplayPort connectors, and users were forced to use adapters whenever they wanted to connect. Not to mention, plenty of people happily use the same monitor for far longer than the laptops they plug into them, particularly when they’re secondary displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAHSZx"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company to have made a bet on USB-C that didn’t quite pay off. In 2018, a consortium of companies that included AMD, Nvidia, Oculus, Valve, and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17583362/virtuallink-vr-headsets-oculus-valve-microsoft-connect-usb-c-cable"&gt;announced VirtualLink&lt;/a&gt;, a USB-C connection standard for VR headsets that could allow them to be powered and broadcast data over a single cable. But although the USB-C port appeared on Nvidia’s 20-series graphics cards, the standard was beset by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525827/valve-index-virtual-reality-usb-c-virtuallink-dongle"&gt;silly dongles and adaptors&lt;/a&gt; (sound familiar?) and had been dropped by the time the 30-series rolled around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAkeRP"&gt;It’s easy to see Apple ditching ports as a cynical cash grab in an attempt to drive sales of its own dongles and USB-C accessories. But a more generous reading is that Apple got its bet on the future wrong. It thought it could outsource a laptop’s ports to desk-based accessories like monitors and docks to make its laptops slimmer and more compact. But that ecosystem never seems to have taken off or become ubiquitous, and what happened instead was that people were forced to carry around endless adapters for simple tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wouG49"&gt;I have a couple of theories why Apple’s vision never became a reality. One is Macs just don’t have the market share to force a change like this across the whole industry, so manufacturers of monitors and peripherals were forced to stick with older standards from Windows machines for their most mainstream devices. Another is the confusing mess of standards supported by USB-C cables and accessories. Between Thunderbolt and USB’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/27/18243425/usb-3-2-standard-names-connectivity-cables-innovators-forum"&gt;smorgasbord of different versions&lt;/a&gt;, it can be difficult to know if a cable is even capable of making the most out of your device’s charging and data transferring capabilities, or — particularly early on — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10916264/usb-c-russian-roulette-power-cords"&gt;whether it’s going to fry its internals&lt;/a&gt;. It’s far from the easy plug-and-play future Apple seems to have had its sights on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EVCHz"&gt;Or, maybe people are more attached to their older PC accessories than Apple anticipated, particularly when it comes to expensive professional equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x0ViRR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s bet on wireless audio on the iPhone paid off in ways its USB-C laptop bet didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUHPZy"&gt;It’s interesting, in retrospect, to compare Apple’s decision to switch wholesale to USB-C on the MacBook with its decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. This was another decision that generated an equal amount of jokes about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12852098/belkin-apple-iphone-7-plus-adapter-dongle-charge-music"&gt;adaptors and dongles&lt;/a&gt; at the time and raised similar suspicions that the move was a cash grab to help the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12839758/apple-is-biggest-winner-from-killing-headphone-jack"&gt;sell more Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. But, five years later, Apple’s decision appears to have been vindicated, with its competitors following suit. There’s now a thriving ecosystem of third-party wireless headphones, and I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw someone using one of Apple’s Lightning to 3.5mm adaptors (though, with wired headphones &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/wired-headphones-cool-airpods-b1936746.html"&gt;reportedly making a retro-styled comeback&lt;/a&gt;, that could change soon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aar6yt"&gt;Whether that’s because Apple is more dominant when it comes to smartphones or just because the benefits of wireless audio were more obvious to people than USB-C accessories, people seem to have been far more ready to roll with Apple’s annoying headphone jack decision. There’s a valid debate to be had about whether Apple kicked off a trend towards wireless audio or whether its move just turbocharged one that was already taking place, but either way, Apple made a bet that the future of smartphone audio was wireless, and for all intents and purposes, it seems to have paid off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5LB8D"&gt;Although Apple stopped short of calling out its past MacBook designs, this week’s announcement was Apple’s biggest mea culpa &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;since the Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; trash can. The event completed the company’s backtrack on basically every controversial decision it’s made with recent MacBooks, after already having made the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;ditch its controversial butterfly keyboard&lt;/a&gt; in favor of more traditional scissor switches. Apple made the wrong call in 2016, but this week, it thankfully got itself back on track. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zz3GG9"&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;new MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; on October 18th, Apple finally also introduced its&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22435385"&gt; third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which are set to ship on October 26th for $179 and are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22429684"&gt;available for preorder now&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733184/apple-second-generation-airpods-wired-charging-case-price-cut-129"&gt;lowered the cost&lt;/a&gt; of the now-entry-level AirPods 2 from $159 to $129 and will now only sell the version that comes with a wired charging case. As a result, the AirPods lineup now consists of four models of AirPods: the $129 AirPods 2, the $179 AirPods 3, the $249 AirPods Pro, and the $549 AirPods Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVI0Qf"&gt;With such a wide range of AirPods available at various price points, it can be overwhelming to try to figure out which one you should purchase. That’s why we’ve put together this guide comparing the models to each other — so you can find the right fit for you. Note that while we have reviewed most of the AirPods in the lineup, we’ve not yet tested the AirPods 3, but we will soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mTJiJM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple AirPods second-gen review: even more wireless","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"},{"title":"Apple AirPods Pro review: perfect fit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"},{"title":"Apple AirPods Max review: luxurious sound for a luxury price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="IaSfdt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10815614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNdTt1"&gt;The AirPods 3, like the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro, are in-ear wireless earbuds. The AirPods 3 weigh about the same as the AirPods 2 – 4.28 grams and 4 grams, respectively. At 5.4 grams, the AirPods Pro are only slightly heavier. The wireless earbuds all measure about the same as well, with the AirPods 2 offering the greatest length (40.5mm x 16.5mm x 18.0mm). While the AirPods 3 (30.8mm x 18.3mm x 19.2mm) measure about the same in length, they’re wider than the AirPods 2. The AirPods Pro (30.9mm x 21.8mm x 24mm) are wider than both the AirPods 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KuKtX"&gt;The AirPods 3, like the AirPods Pro, are sweat and water-resistant, unlike the AirPods 2 (and the Max). That means you don’t need to worry about them during an intense workout or when it rains. The AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro also offer shorter stems than the AirPods 2, while the AirPods Pro come with replaceable silicone ear tips in three different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro versus the AirPods Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hq12um"&gt;In contrast to the small plastic AirPods earbuds, the AirPods Max are a large over-ear pair of headphones that offers stainless steel earcups with a curvy mesh headband. They weigh in at 384.8 grams and measure 187.3mm x 168.6mm x 83.4mm. While the earbuds only come in white, you can buy the Max in a variety of different colors, including silver, space grey, sky blue, pink, and green. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods 2 made it possible to recharge the case on a wireless pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TogjVJ"&gt;Each device comes with a Lightning-to-USB-C cable and a charging case. However, the kind of charging case differs. The AirPods 2 include a wired charging case (53.5mm x 44.3mm x 21.3mm) that can only be charged with a Lightning cable. Meanwhile, the cases for the AirPods 3 (46.4mm x 54.4mm x 21.4mm) and the Airpods Pro (45.2mm x 60.6mm x 21.7mm) can be charged wirelessly or with the cable. The AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro also now support MagSafe technology, the same magnetic attachment and charging system you can use with the iPhone. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max have their own Smart Case, which is designed to preserve battery charge by putting the headphones into a very low power state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM0hCC"&gt;All of the AirPods are compatible with the latest iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs. However, the AirPods 2 are also compatible with older devices, like the iPhone 5s, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 2, and the 6th-generation iPod touch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Biodu-zsfWv5aKYI9wPm1cEb13s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938890/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_8.29.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods 3 will be available on October 26th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1HiQiX"&gt;All of the AirPods in the current lineup are powered by Apple’s H1 headphone chip now that the AirPods 2 — and not the first-generation, which offered a W1 chip — are the entry-level model. As a result, all support Bluetooth 5.0, and you can launch Siri via a voice command on all of the devices. You’ll also be able to automatically switch between your various Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG2LyU"&gt;The over-ears AirPods Max come with a Digital Control knob borrowed from the Apple Watch and another button you can use to alternate between the Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes. However, there is no power button. In contrast, the earbuds rely solely on touch controls — and even in this, they can differ. To play a tune, skip forward, or answer a phone call on the AirPods 2, you need to double-tap. However, with the AirPods 3, AirPods Pro, and the Digital Crown on the AirPods Max, you just need to click once to pause, play, or answer a call. Meanwhile, you can press twice to skip forward and three times to skip back. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vub7LogNg805GYpulKIm1syQA_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938895/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_8.31.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods 3 offers spatial audio with dynamic head tracking and Dolby Atmos in Apple Music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ou6uo5"&gt;Audio features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AKhVkZ"&gt;As we’ve noted in our reviews — with the exception of the AirPods 3, which we’ve yet to test — all of the AirPods in the lineup offer great sound quality. Each new earbud model offers iterative improvements that enhance the audio experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJP2Ec"&gt;Of course, the AirPods 3, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max offer a lot more in comparison to the older AirPods 2 when it comes to audio technology. All three of the newer models boast support for spatial audio, which should result in an immersive, theater-like sound quality experience. While the AirPods 2 featured limited spatial audio through Apple Music only, the other three include spatial audio for group FaceTime calls, Netflix, and other content as well. The AirPods 3 also offer spatial audio with dynamic head tracking across all Apple devices, as well as Dolby Atmos in Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgwRuU"&gt;The AirPods 3, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max all boast features like Adaptive EQ, which customizes your audio experience, and an intuitive force sensor for media control. Apple says the custom high-excursion Apple drivers found in all three also deliver powerful bass. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max are built with H1 chips in each ear cup, so you get ample bass. The three models also include a custom high dynamic range amplifier that offers clear sound and lengthens battery life (the AirPods Max lacks this latter feature). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8fSD5"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max offer Active Noise Cancellation, which silences background noises so you can better focus on what you’re listening to. These models are also the only ones that offer the option to switch to Transparency Mode, which makes it possible to hear the sounds around you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YuNGcz8IBVQajdFqVk6GHwUE70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173866/DSCF2681_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max offers 44mm drivers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6GEHBn"&gt;As far as call quality is concerned, the AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro all offer dual beamforming microphones — in other words, every set has two mics in each ear cup, with technology designed to reduce outside noises and better focus on your voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKs86B"&gt;However, unlike the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro, the AirPods 2 doesn’t offer inward-facing microphones. That means it’s not able to listen inside of your ear to reduce internal sounds. The AirPods Max, meanwhile, offer nine microphones: eight for active noise cancellation and three for voice pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mVJwTVLkFjyToscJgHNl1jB0Aoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336093/akrales_191030_3763_0378.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Active noise cancelation option on an iPhone paired with the AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QEKtUN"&gt;The AirPods 2, AirPods 3, and AirPods Pro all offer motion-detecting accelerometers that detect taps and speech-detecting accelerometers. The latter recognizes when you’re speaking, working with the beamforming microphones to silence outside sounds and pick up only your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjWSfZ"&gt;Both the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro offer dual optical sensors that help detect when they’re in your ears, although the AirPods 3 doesn’t. Instead, it offers a skin detect sensor, which uses your skin to determine whether your AirPods are in your ears or not and, thus, whether it should play or pause audio. On the other hand, both the AirPods 3 and the Airpods Pro offer an intuitive force sensor for media control — something the AirPods 2 lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5nyc"&gt;The AirPods Max include an optical sensor and accelerometer in each ear cup. The headphones additionally come with a position and a case-detect sensor for each ear to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;automatically detect when they are on a user’s head. The left ear cup also has a gyroscope; all of these sensors combined make it possible to combine dynamic head tracking with spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cMZYNzByXtWocPciu5DPaLatDJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159223/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max offers an H1 chip and sensors in each ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sFRSTg"&gt;As might be expected, the AirPods Max overwhelmingly outperform the rest of the AirPods when it comes to battery life. Apple says they offer up to 20 hours of listening time on a single charge with Active Noise Cancellation or Transparency mode on. With spatial audio enabled, the AirPods Max also offers up to 20 hours of movie playback on a single charge. Meanwhile, Apple says five minutes of charging provides around 1.5 hours of listening time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhi7XR"&gt;In contrast, Apple claims the AirPods 2 offer up to five hours of listening time on a single charge, while the AirPods 3 offer six hours. The tech giant also says the entry-level AirPods offer over 24 hours of listening time with the charging case, just like the AirPods Pro. Despite being cheaper than the AirPods Pro, the AirPods 3 beat them and the AirPods 2, offering up to 30 hours. The AirPods Pro also offer the least amount of listening on one charge — only 4.5 hours and up to five hours with Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency turned off. The Pro additionally offer up to 3.5 hours of talk time with a single charge, while the AirPods 3 offer up to three hours of talk time. In contrast, the AirPods 2 beats both, offering up to five hours of listening time with one charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzO40w"&gt;When it comes to charging case battery life, the AirPods 3 also differ from the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro, offering up to 30 hours of listening time as opposed to the Pro and AirPods 2 providing over 24 hours of listening time. The AirPods 3 also offer up to 20 hours of talk time versus over 18 hours of talk time for the Pro and up to 18 hours of talk time for the AirPods 2. Apple claims both the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro, however, take five minutes to provide about an hour of listening time or an hour of talk time. In contrast, the AirPods 2 need to be in the case for 15 minutes to provide up to three hours of listening time or up to two hours of talk time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="OjwqrU"&gt;Which should you buy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="s4fzuv"&gt;No matter which you buy, each model in the AirPods lineup should offer great sound and call quality. However, which model you should purchase depends upon your needs and budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uDRQK"&gt;Off the bat, if you want over-ear headphones, obviously the AirPods Max are the ones you should buy. They are also the top choice for sound quality and offer features the others don’t, ranging from active noise cancellation to an H1 chip and sensors in each ear cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjmy7B"&gt;On the other hand, if you’re looking for a great pair of earpods, pick up the AirPods 3 or AirPods Pro, especially if you often engage in intense workouts, both of which offer sweat and water resistance. And if you’ve had trouble in the past with earpods slipping out of your ears, you may want to choose the AirPods Pro for their replaceable and customizable ear tips, which is something the AirPods 3 don’t offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ly2Hgf"&gt;If you’re on a tight budget, however, and want something under $200, consider the AirPods 3. Unless you’re truly strapped for cash, it’s worth forking out an extra $50 for the extra perks the AirPods 2 don’t offer, like a MagSafe charging case, greater spatial audio support, improved battery life, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators call on Facebook to shelve Novi cryptocurrency project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHFeW2FGBZgjMAtBllEcTfg6cBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017250/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLWLJd"&gt;Senate Democrats called on Facebook to end its digital wallet and cryptocurrency project in a letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday, saying that the company “cannot be trusted to manage cryptocurrency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UreiCB"&gt;The letter comes hours after Facebook launched Novi, a new digital wallet, as part of a “small” pilot program in the US and Guatemala. Facebook first announced its plans to enter the cryptocurrency industry over two years ago, but the digital currency project, called Libra, was halted after heavy criticism from lawmakers and regulators. The Libra currency was later rebranded as “Diem,” which has yet to be released alongside the new wallet product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ye2gMB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The letter comes hours after Facebook launched Novi&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3MKUj"&gt;In their letter, Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and others wrote, “Facebook is once again pursuing digital currency plans on an aggressive timeline and has already launched a pilot for a payments infrastructure network, even though these plans are incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape — not only for Diem specifically, but also for stablecoins in general.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XELpfy"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday, a Novi spokesperson said, “We look forward to responding to the Committee’s letter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uthzU7"&gt;Without its own currency, Facebook’s Novi wallet will allow users to send and receive money using the Paxos stablecoin in a partnership with Coinbase. Coinbase serves as the custody partner, holding the actual funds involved with the pilot program. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447443250728962?s=20"&gt;In a statement issued Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s David Marcus, head of F2 (Facebook Financial), said that the company still plans to launch Novi with Diem “once it receives regulatory approval and goes live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDEkVH"&gt;In 2019, the House and Senate hauled Zuckerberg in to provide testimony on the Libra project after weeks of back and forth with lawmakers who were largely skeptical of Facebook’s project. The hearing came only a year after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929313/mark-zuckerberg-hearing-congress-libra-calibra-facebook-maxine-waters"&gt;lawmakers questioned the company’s credibility&lt;/a&gt; in light of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofoyEF"&gt;In Tuesday’s letter, the senators invoked these same concerns. “Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient,” they wrote. “We urge you to immediately discontinue your Novi pilot and to commit that you will not bring Diem to market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UckzVd"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; came before the Senate Commerce Committee to testify on the harms Facebook and its other products can inflict on users. Republicans and Democrats shared concerns over how platforms like Instagram could hurt teenagers, and Haugen’s testimony has already been met with legislative proposals to regulate the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voDoaq"&gt;The Novi criticism from lawmakers also arrives as Facebook is bracing itself for more disclosures from Haugen, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154004730707972?s=20"&gt;a Monday Facebook Newsroom tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mP0XzE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10/19/21 at 4:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Novi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sinclair TV stations experienced a massive outage during ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBG)..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DC9WWSqjCGL69m7FFqRo5b3-y0U=/0x14:3848x2579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70017024/1234599696.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDAxHo"&gt;Sinclair, the broadcast group that runs some of the most popular local channels across the US, experienced a nationwide outage during a ransomware attack on October 16th (via &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/sinclair-tv-stations-disrupted-across-the-us-in-apparent-ransomware-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Viewers initially were informed technical difficulties caused the disruption, but the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912752/000119312521300540/d245680dex991.htm"&gt;US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; published a filing from Sinclair two days later, identifying ransomware as the source of the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u06cks"&gt;“Certain servers and workstations in its environment were encrypted with ransomware, and that certain office and operational networks were disrupted,” the report reads. “Data also was taken from the Company’s network. The Company is working to determine what information the data contained and will take other actions as appropriate based on its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzF4Ic"&gt;A person close to the situation tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that as of yesterday, employees still had problems accessing email or signing into systems, but today, those things are restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fLWMg5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US Treasury identified over $590 million in suspected ransomware-related transactions between January and June&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cgvhnG"&gt;Sinclair’s report also notes the company still isn’t up and running at 100 percent. While it’s trying to resolve the issue, there may still be “disruption to parts of the Company’s business, including certain aspects of its provision of local advertisements by its local broadcast stations on behalf of its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJ2vof"&gt;Sinclair operates a massive number of local TV stations, causing the attack to prevent the company from broadcasting local news shows, sports games, and other scheduled content. According to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;, the attack could’ve been much worse, as the bad actors weren’t able to compromise something called the “master control.” Having access to this tool let Sinclair replace some scheduled shows with a national feed — that way, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of its channels were completely down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsxaop"&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; notes, the ransomware attack was preceded by a &lt;a href="https://www.ftvlive.com/sqsp-test/2021/7/7/sinclair-cyber-attack"&gt;call for a password reset across all of Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; following the discovery of a “potentially serious network security issue.” It’s unclear whether that security issue has anything to do with the attack that just transpired. There still isn’t an official count of how many stations were shut down, as well as who exactly was responsible for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tez70y"&gt;Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly common; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616882/gigabyte-technologies-ransomware-attack-data-leak-112-gb-ransomexx"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;CNA Financial&lt;/a&gt; are just some of the high-profile companies targeted this year. According to a report by the US Treasury, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;ransomware payouts in 2021 are on track to beat the combined payouts from the entire past decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
