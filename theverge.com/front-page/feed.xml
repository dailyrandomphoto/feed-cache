    <title>Warner Bros. will release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lsq6E4"&gt;WarnerMedia is pushing even more aggressively into streaming by releasing every single movie in 2021 simultaneously on HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdPM7m"&gt;There are some limitations to the new business model. The movies will only stream on HBO Max for one month before leaving the platform for a period of time. They will also play in theaters, keeping the relationship with movie theater distributors like AMC and Regal. The plan is to run this experiment for one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaDPNy"&gt;The movies Warner Bros. is planning to release include: &lt;em&gt;The Little Things, Judas and the Black Messiah, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Those Who Wish Me Dead, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, In The Heights, Space Jam: A New Legacy, The Suicide Squad, Reminiscence, Malignant, Dune, The Many Saints of Newark, King Richard, Cry Macho &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Matrix 4. &lt;/em&gt;All films will be released in 4K Ultra HD and HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwVOwr"&gt;“We’re living in unprecedented times which call for creative solutions, including this new initiative for the Warner Bros. Pictures Group,” said Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff. “No one wants films back on the big screen more than we do. We know new content is the lifeblood of theatrical exhibition, but we have to balance this with the reality that most theaters in the U.S. will likely operate at reduced capacity throughout 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsVszk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez0zRk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drone footage shows the shocking collapse of the Arecibo Observatory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGfKc6hCahMDKditbfCN1Tfqre4=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449981/arecibo_collapse.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yLpjVs"&gt;Today, the National Science Foundation (NSF) released shocking footage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754959/arecibo-observatory-platform-collapse-dish-puerto-rico-telescope"&gt;the collapse of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. The video, captured on December 1st, shows the moment when support cables snapped, causing the massive 900-ton structure suspended above Arecibo to fall onto the observatory’s iconic 1,000-foot-wide dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ll4nGL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the drone operator was very adept to see what was happening.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7kKJcx"&gt;The videos of the collapse were captured by a camera located in Arecibo’s Operations Control Center, as well as from a drone located above the platform at the time of collapse. The operator of the drone was able to adjust the drone camera once the platform started to fall and capture the moment of impact. NSF, which oversees Arecibo, had been doing hourly monitoring of the observatory with drones, ever since engineers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575025/arecibo-observatory-puerto-rico-decommission-structural-collapse-cable-break"&gt;warned that the structure was on the verge of collapsing in November&lt;/a&gt;. “I think we were just lucky and the drone operator was very adept to see what was happening and be able to turn the camera,” Ashley Zauderer, the NSF program manager for Arecibo Observatory, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D2sk4A"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Arecibo Observatory Collapse|99655" data-volume-uuid="7ab800b8d" data-volume-id="99655" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-16" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ilhJpB"&gt;The footage highlights the moment when multiple cables snapped, causing the platform to swing outward and hit the side of the dish. The collapse also brought down the tops of the three support towers surrounding Arecibo, where the cables had been connected to keep the platform in the air. “The cables that go from the top of Tower 4 to the platform — they’re very faint in the camera view but they’re there,” said John Abruzzo, a contractor at engineering consulting firm Thornton Tomasetti,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;hired by the University of Central Florida. “And so it’s those cables that fail near the tower top first, and then once those fail, the platform then loses stability and starts to come down,” Abruzzo said, describing the first video from the control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saU2ZL"&gt;The collapse of Arecibo didn’t come as a surprise. Following the failure of two support cables in both August and November, engineers had concluded that there was no safe way to repair Arecibo and that the platform could fall onto the dish at any moment. NSF hoped to do a controlled demolition of the telescope before that happened, but the collapse occurred before any kind of action could take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="E9r0Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s very early for us to comment on the replacement.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ime1Rj"&gt;Now NSF is trying to figure out a path forward, which mostly revolves around figuring out how to clean up Arecibo in a safe manner. Engineers need to do a full environmental assessment of the area and figure out how stable the remaining structures are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S62v2"&gt;Replacing Arecibo would be a much longer process, involving decisions from lawmakers. “With regards to replacement, NSF has a very well defined process for funding and constructing large scale infrastructure — including telescopes,” Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s division of astronomical sciences&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;said. “It’s a multi-year process that involves congressional appropriations, and the assessment and needs of the scientific community. So it’s very early for us to comment on the replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter turns off threaded replies because they made conversations hard to read</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eyOqB-ff0RemVulJa5kE7I7cwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449979/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QgdNa"&gt;Twitter has been experimenting with threaded replies for some time as a way to potentially make replies easier to read and follow. But the company has decided to end those experiments because of user feedback, it announced on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHs05V"&gt;“We asked and you let us know this reply layout wasn’t it, as it was harder to read and join conversations,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334544255298232320"&gt;the company wrote in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; published today. “So we’ve turned off this format to work on other ways to improve conversations on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JvPAXT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your feedback shapes Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We asked and you let us know this reply layout wasn’t it, as it was harder to read and join conversations. So we’ve turned off this format to work on other ways to improve conversations on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pA4Yd0QfyW"&gt;https://t.co/pA4Yd0QfyW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334544255298232320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ6v7g"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552671462641664"&gt;follow-up tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the company said threaded replies made conversations harder to read and join and that people wanted more context about who they were talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VOylI6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some learnings:&lt;br&gt;*the new look made convos harder to read &amp;amp; join – we’re exploring other ways to make this easier.&lt;br&gt;*you want more context about who you're talking to – we're working to add this.&lt;br&gt;*you want more control – we’re iterating on our convo settings.&lt;a href="https://t.co/UzS08x4Jcf"&gt;https://t.co/UzS08x4Jcf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552671462641664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsqWwU"&gt;Twitter is also shutting down its beta app, which the company called twttr, designed for experiments like threaded replies. “For now we’re turning [twttr] off so we can work on new tests to improve the conversation experience on Twitter,” the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032"&gt;in another tweet&lt;/a&gt;. People currently using twttr will lose access for now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552672435720193"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cr1Poq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We appreciate the feedback you gave us through this run of our prototype app twttr. For now we’re turning it off so we can work on new tests to improve the conversation experience on Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re using twttr, switch to the main Twitter app to keep up with what’s happening. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH"&gt;https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IZX49V"&gt;Trying to follow more than even a few replies on most tweets can be a headache (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18222558/kara-swisher-jack-dorsey-twitter-interview-conversation-karajack-livetweet"&gt;infamous Twitter conversation&lt;/a&gt; between CEO Jack Dorsey and &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; co-founder Kara Swisher), and threaded replies were Twitter’s attempt to make tracking them more straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSoG0Q"&gt;Twitter first signaled it was considering threaded replies back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17807092/twitter-threading-replies-status-update-product-test-update"&gt;in August 2018&lt;/a&gt;, rolled them out along with twttr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262457/twitter-twttr-beta-app-threaded-replies-hands-on"&gt;in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, added them to the iOS app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117608/twitter-ios-app-replies-design-ui-change-update"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;, and revised how threaded replies looked for some on iOS and the web &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249011/twitter-threaded-conversations-test-ios-web-lines-indents-interface-hiding-like-retweet-buttons"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems the product change was one users didn’t like, so Twitter is reverting back to its old system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSrMN1"&gt;Hopefully, the company comes up with a new solution at some point. But for now, we’ll be stuck scrolling forever on high-reply tweets to figure out exactly what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google fires prominent AI ethicist Timnit Gebru</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2018 - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9VOo-SZaUI2UExi_IMNFQ1jPnw=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449916/1028811892.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White / Getty Images for TechCrunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QIDSeL"&gt;Timnit Gebru, one of Google’s top artificial intelligence researchers, says the company abruptly fired her yesterday. The technical co-lead of Google’s Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team claims managers were upset about an email she’d sent to colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKekMh"&gt;The email, which was sent to the Brain Women and Allies listserv, voiced frustration that managers were trying to get Gebru to retract a research paper. &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;The full text was first published in &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar,” it reads. “Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you ‘it has been decided’ that you need to retract this paper by next week... You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPkBNn"&gt;After the email went out, Gebru told managers that certain conditions had to be met in order for her to stay at the company. Otherwise, she would have to work on a transition plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Megan Kacholia, vice president of engineering at Google Research, said she could not meet the conditions and accepted Gebru’s resignation as a result, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/noted-a-i-ethicist-timnit-gebru-leaves-google-following-tense-email-exchange-f602cdb7fe89"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kacholia added, “However, we believe the end of your employment should happen faster than your email reflects because certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager,” according to Gebru. On Twitter, she claimed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952"&gt;the decision to fire her ultimately came from Google’s head of AI, Jeff Dean&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6JOP9V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apparently my manager’s manager sent an email my direct reports saying she accepted my resignation. I hadn’t resigned—I had asked for simple conditions first and said I would respond when I’m back from vacation. But I guess she decided for me :) that’s the lawyer speak.&lt;/p&gt;— Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334341991795142667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZLjqv"&gt;Gebru is famous for her work on algorithmic bias, particularly in facial recognition technology. In 2018, she co-authored a paper with Joy Buolamwini showing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;error rates for identifying darker-skinned people were far higher than the error rates for identifying white-skinned people&lt;/a&gt;, in part because the datasets used to train algorithms were overwhelmingly white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBMDNy"&gt;News of Gebru’s alleged firing swept through Twitter yesterday, prompting an outpouring of support from colleagues and collaborators. “I have your back as you have always had mine,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jovialjoy/status/1334495010427899906"&gt;Buolamwini tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “You are brilliant and respected. You listen to those others readily ignore. You ask hard questions not to advance yourself but to uplift the communities we owe our foundations. I am proud to call you leader mentor friend sister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuivGR"&gt;Hours earlier, news broke about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;the National Labor Relations Board filing a complaint against Google&lt;/a&gt; for firing two workers last year in the wake of employee organizing efforts. At the time, Google said the employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, had violated security policies and internal systems. But the NLRB found these rules violated labor laws and alleged Berland and Spiers had done nothing wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEopgb"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will remove COVID-19 vaccine misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QVGXI1V9VhaDnxdh1NXVpPNm2zg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449884/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGkJFs"&gt;In an update to their COVID-19 misinformation policy, Facebook will begin removing false claims about COVID-19 vaccines. The update comes as one COVID-19 vaccine has been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/uk/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-uk-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;authorized in the UK&lt;/a&gt; and other authorizations are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;expected to happen soon&lt;/a&gt; in the US and around the world. But some experts say these kinds of policies are coming too late to stop the flow of vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQXaO2"&gt;The policy previously involved removing posts with false information about the virus that could lead to “imminent physical harm.” Facebook is now &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/coronavirus/#misinformation-update"&gt;expanding the policy&lt;/a&gt; to include any posts about vaccines that feature claims which have been “debunked by public health experts.” This includes conspiracy theories — like vaccines containing microchips — and false claims about the safety, efficacy, ingredients, or side effects of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZA85Da"&gt;Facebook says enforcement will not happen overnight, and that as facts about COVID-19 vaccines evolve, the list of claims that constitute removal will be regularly updated. But even with an expanded policy for removing posts, much of the damage of vaccine misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/covid-19-vaccines-face-varied-powerful-misinformation-movement-online-n1249378"&gt;has already been done&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIlhKO"&gt;Anti-vaccination rhetoric has often proliferated in small, private Facebook groups. Hundreds of smaller groups are more difficult to monitor and remove than larger ones, and they can spread anti-vaccination messaging to groups that have no obvious connection to conspiracy theorists. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/tech/covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-social-media/index.html"&gt;Experts worry that the consistent spread&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation throughout the pandemic could make people more hesitant to get a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27Tw5b"&gt;Many major platforms have been under pressure during the pandemic to combat COVID-19 misinformation. When it comes to vaccine-related claims, Facebook is behind YouTube, which began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515796/youtube-covid-vaccine-misniformation-policy"&gt;removing videos with COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; in October. As vaccines begin to roll out, it will be important for these platforms to keep up strict moderation on vaccine-related&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;content.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will ask commenters to rethink posting if their message seems offensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JKI8adtg2Ztzwsbgcg8jXS37J4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449820/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HBFLa3"&gt;YouTube is trying to combat offensive comments that appear under videos by following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286855/twitter-articles-prompt-unread-feature-conversations"&gt;other social media companies&lt;/a&gt; and asking people before they post something that may be offensive: “Is this something you really want to share?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s15mkm"&gt;The company is launching a new product feature that will warn people when they’re going to post a comment that it “may be offensive to others,” in order to give them “the option to reflect before posting,” according to a new blog post. The tool won’t actually stop people from posting said comment. Prompts won’t appear before every comment, but it will for ones that YouTube’s system deems offensive, which is based on content that’s been repeatedly reported. Once the prompt does appear, people can post the comment as they originally intended or use additional time to edit the comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeEwr"&gt;For creators, the company is also rolling out better content filtering systems in YouTube Studio (the backend where creators manage their channel). The new filter will seek out inappropriate or hurtful comments that were automatically flagged and held for review, and remove them from the queue so people don’t have to read them. The new feature will roll out on Android first and in English before appearing elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPSdLv"&gt;There’s no question that YouTube has a problem with hurtful comments on the site, but one of the bigger issues is hateful comments. Through automatic filtering, the company has removed over 46 times more daily hate speech comments since early 2019 than ever before, according to YouTube. Then there’s videos. YouTube claims that of the 1.8 million channels terminated last quarter, more than 54,000 were due to hate speech. Those were the most bans for hate speech content in a single quarter that YouTube has seen, and three times as high than in early 2019 when new hate speech policies went into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zLBwRn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hateful speech and hurtful comments are just some of the problems that greatly affect the creator community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVck9F"&gt;YouTube is also trying to combat other issues affecting creators, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449717/youtube-age-restriction-machine-learning-rollout-kids-content-monetization-creators"&gt;monetization&lt;/a&gt;, bias, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17879652/youtube-creator-youtuber-burnout-problem"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;, and channel growth concerns. To better understand how different communities are impacted, the company will start to ask YouTubers to voluntarily supply information about their gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity beginning in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ks4zXc"&gt;The goal is to use the data to pinpoint how different communities are treated both in terms of discovery on the platform and when it comes to monetization. The LGBTQ creator community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21278050/youtube-lawsuit-lgbtq-google-doj-section-230-trump-executive-order"&gt;has consistently said&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube’s systems automatically demonetize their content or hide their videos, and they have publicly fought against the treatment they receive. YouTube’s teams also want to use the data to find “possible patterns of hate, harassment, and discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsVu1T"&gt;One of the biggest questions is how that data will be used and stored once it’s collected. YouTube’s blog post states that the survey will outline how the information will be applied to the company’s research and what control creators retain over their data. The blog post as it stands does not specify that now. Instead, the company states that information will not be used for advertising purposes. People will also retain the ability to opt out and delete their information whenever they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aa6jQV"&gt;“If we find any issues in our systems that impact specific communities, we’re committed to working to fix them,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7xTav"&gt;There’s no current timeline for when the surveys will roll out, but more information about the project will be released in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Microsoft crushed Slack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euTGg6BbDC8-dN9I1MEiCObXSLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449684/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhCi46"&gt;Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2nd, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad"&gt;published an open letter to Microsoft in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch"&gt;Microsoft’s launch of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDfNQi"&gt;In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding, “We’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;took Teams from zero to 115 million users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6b1wI"&gt;That disparity helps to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html"&gt;Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/"&gt;offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5nRQry"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wzqXxm"&gt;But it also feels like the end of an era, one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work and was often dragged into organizations by early adoption. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2Obsc"&gt;The rise of smartphones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZZcJp"&gt;Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users"&gt;Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users&lt;/a&gt; — a figure then unheard of in enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUzVVw"&gt;It had a great backstory — a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called &lt;em&gt;Glitch&lt;/em&gt; — and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” — or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it — and it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2NpF8"&gt;The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WlwJG9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; that this was the outcome for Slack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uRlRnj"&gt;And yet, if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Une4h"&gt;The thing is, I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants, Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21"&gt;a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xau72"&gt;But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died, and Acompli sold to Microsoft where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain — public companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKNXAY"&gt;Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling — and he also wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work"&gt;a blog post about the Slack acquisition&lt;/a&gt; — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t even want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er... salesforce behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R8FdL"&gt;Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwQ4wc"&gt;“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOuJST"&gt;Levie is bullish on the acquisition because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6nrAt"&gt;“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5KLOrq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable or Notion or Coda?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKVptR"&gt;Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cja2AV"&gt;That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable or Notion or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some — but do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSKlsx"&gt;If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPOuVk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose ‘Sport Open Earbuds’ with ear hooks appear at FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cNDjKx5AEE607MeEioucYXWGgYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449603/BoseOpen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9sTRKY"&gt;It looks like Bose is planning another set of true wireless earbuds to join its QuietComfort and Sport Earbuds. Today, filings for the “Sport Open Earbuds” &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A94109R"&gt;have appeared at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; — with plenty of photos of the unannounced product contained within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJT3e4"&gt;The design makes clear that Bose is going for a fitness-first set of earbuds here, with a completely open, plastic exterior that seems to just rest against your ear. It’s held in place by an ear hook, and there’s a button visible at the bottom of each earbud. A charger for the Sport Open Earbuds is also seen in the filing. The product name is confirmed several times in the documentation and is visible on the labels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlm8b1y6NVGstxUKwo2EMrPF2tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141550/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_12.17.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XLdHwF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Bose for more details on the Sport Open Earbuds. The Sport Earbuds released earlier this year cost $159, but they’ve got an in-ear design with silicone tips. This open alternative could be more targeted at people who don't like how earbuds feel and want greater awareness of their surroundings when running or during other fitness activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48OKJ6"&gt;There’s a lot we don’t know yet about the Sport Open Earbuds like battery life, sweat resistance rating, and how this totally open style will actually &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; compared to the company’s more traditional earbuds. But it might be worth holding off on your next purchase of fitness buds until we get the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon now lets you text Alexa on iOS to ask for things instead of only using your voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bq38Bgg-cWgI9IMVIOFLQouI9q0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449526/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mVMJ7w"&gt;Amazon is testing a new feature for its iOS Alexa app: the ability to type out Alexa commands, instead of having to ask questions or requests by speaking out loud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04yLIB"&gt;“Type with Alexa is a Public Preview feature available to iOS Alexa app customers allowing you to interact with Alexa without using voice, meaning everything you can currently say to Alexa can now also be typed using your Alexa mobile app. Type with Alexa is available to iOS customers in the U.S.,” said an Amazon spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-FQ4-QZGN0KR37kVM7MCFoTkUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141390/Untitled.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5VVPli"&gt;The new feature — &lt;a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/news/type-with-alexa-new-keyboard-feature-2435"&gt;first spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Ambient&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — is available for iOS users in the Alexa app. To access it, simply tap the keyboard icon that now appears on the top left of the main menu of the app. The typed-out commands should work identically to verbal ones, although Amazon notes that it’s still a public preview, and Alexa is “still getting the hang of it.” In other words, there might be a bug or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUhBEU"&gt;Being able to type out your requests to a digital assistant isn’t a new idea (both Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri have offered it for years), but it’s good to see that Amazon is working to offer a similar option for Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd8nbC"&gt;For now, Type with Alexa is available in public preview for iOS users. Amazon has yet to say when it’ll be releasing a final version of the feature or when it will be available on other platforms like Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five new Android features coming this winter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6eGCSbMHKYx4B3aJHEMcWZpaR4=/1304x0:4906x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449450/Android_feature_winter.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New features coming for Google Maps, Gboard, Voice Access, Google Play Books, and Nearby Share.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwKvTW"&gt;Google is rolling out five new Android features in the weeks ahead that enhance Maps navigation, Gboard emoji mashups, Voice Access, Google Play audiobooks, and Nearby Share file sharing. Google is also making Android Auto available in 36 more countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elcP0P"&gt;To start with, Google is giving Maps a new Go tab that lets you quickly navigate to favorite places without entering the address. Pin driving destinations to school or work, for example, and the Go tab will show directions, live traffic and disruptions, and an estimated arrival time. You can also pin your favorite public transport route to see departure and arrival times and any delays right from the tab. Google suggests pinning both driving and public transport options to the same destination to see which will get your there faster. The Go tab will start rolling out to Android and iOS devices “in the coming weeks,” according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o8FaD_OxNSmpuVhWpC0GD6zWN28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140893/maps_go.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quickly access pinned destinations in new Go tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rxB2vT"&gt;Next up, Google is expanding those custom emoji sticker mashups available on Gboard from a few hundred unique combinations to more than 14,000. The so-called Emoji Kitchen now lets you tap two emoji to see suggested combinations, or double a single emoji to see “more intense” variations. Available already on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin"&gt;Gboard beta&lt;/a&gt;, Google says the new Emoji Kitchen will be available on Android 6.0 and above “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jXXm4p"&gt;Google is also making a change that could result in more audiobooks in the Play Store. Google says that it’s providing publishers in the US and UK with a new auto-generated narrator tool than can be used to create audio versions of books that currently lack them. The tool is currently in beta, and should be coming to all publishers in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7AFkob"&gt;Next up, Google is bringing its enhanced &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Voice Access&lt;/a&gt; navigation, already available in Android 11, to all devices globally running Android 6.0 and above. With the help of machine learning, Voice Access allows UI elements such as buttons and labels to be more easily manipulated by voice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bby7YbVM0wtbvxkyB-wZ1IN2MrU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140897/voice_naviation.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating Maps using Voice Access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yYk00c"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353020/android-nearby-share-file-sharing-feature-launch-airdrop"&gt;Nearby Share&lt;/a&gt; functionality will also soon support the direct sharing of Play Store apps with nearby Android users. The apps are sent via whatever method your two phones deem the fastest: Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, WebRTC, or peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. To share an app from Google Play you’ll need to head to the “Share Apps” menu in “Manage Apps &amp;amp; Games” and select the app to share. Your friend must then accept the incoming app. This particular update will start rolling out in “the coming weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ5T3k"&gt;Lastly, Google says that it’s expanding &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/"&gt;Android Auto&lt;/a&gt; support to 36 more countries over “the next few months,” bringing Google’s apps and services to the dashboard of &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/"&gt;compatible cars&lt;/a&gt; for anyone running Android 10 or above (Android 9 users can download the app).&lt;/p&gt;
