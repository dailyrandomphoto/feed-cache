    <title>This scientist shoots trees to study how they migrate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvfXikZzFrayfhGf0IUxW6EJmAk=/15x0:2040x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376928/Container.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZ7xjG"&gt;In Black Rock Forest, just north of New York City, Angie Patterson aims a shotgun at a northern red oak tree. Patterson is a plant ecophysiologist, and the leaves that she’s shooting out of the canopy will give her data to understand how and why trees migrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRzD23"&gt;Trees have been on the move since at least the last ice age. As their native habitats become inhospitable, tree ranges shift, slowly, to areas they can thrive. But climate change is disrupting the process, scientists say. As of 2019, the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/"&gt;IUCN Red List categorized&lt;/a&gt; more than 20,000 tree species as threatened, and upward of 1,400 as critically endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l68bsI"&gt;As scientists scramble to learn more about what drives tree migration, others are planning for the future. To preserve biodiversity, both citizens and researchers are employing interventionist tactics once steeped in controversy like “assisted migration” — taking tree seedlings and planting them in new locations. Rising global temperatures may force wildlife agencies and forest managers to decide what to save and what to leave behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri6H9E"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; video team trekked into the woods with “the shotgun scientist” to learn how and why trees move to new locations. Can we do anything to help the trees? And what tough calls will we have to make if we can’t? Watch our latest video to see what we discovered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify wants to make the yearly Wrapped experience more than a once a year thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25-dFJRDefOwTztI67HJKBUx6YI=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376909/spotifyonlyyou.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s Only You feature will visualize listeners’ data. | Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="frnxic"&gt;Spotify loves when people share its annual Wrapped music breakdown on social media, so it’s making that more of a year-round treat. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-06-02/celebrate-your-unique-listening-style-with-spotifys-only-you-in-app-experience"&gt;is announcing&lt;/a&gt; a new digital experience today called Only You, which will give users personalized playlists in a shareable form. The in-app experience will give users a variety of playlists and data insights based on their music listening habits, and a new feature called Blend will let two friends automatically merge their musical tastes into a playlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhbGzb"&gt;Among the new experience highlights is “Your Dream Dinner Party,” which lets users pick three artists they’d invite to a dinner party with Spotify making a mix for each artist. Another is “Your Artist Pairs,” which highlights unique pairings that show off a listener’s musical range, as well as “Your Audio Birth Chart,’ which gives users their “Sun artist,” or the person they listened to the most over the past six months; their “Moon artist,” which is the artist they listen to that shows off their emotional side; and their “Rising artist,” which is one they’ve recently found. The Audio Birth Chart and Dream Dinner Party will update daily, while the other data visualization aspects of the feature, like Your Artist Pairs, is based on a limited set of time and won’t update regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b3hgEanZoTkZ6N6VSWMoEUFO_xY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554497/Spotify_OnlyYou_InApp_05_DinnerParty.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s Your Dream Dinner Party feature lets people pick the artists they’d want at a dinner party and receive playlists in return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7FOKLV"&gt;None of these features are revolutionary, but people seemingly love seeing visualized data on their listening habits. During Wrapped season last year, when Spotify gives users a year-in-review look at their listening data, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/spotify-technology-soars-to-record-amid-2020wrapped-buzz?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;its stock jumped&lt;/a&gt; 16 percent and the app rose rapidly in the App Store rankings. Clearly, the company is trying to replicate that success and build buzz with another data visualization offering. The idea is, of course, that if you want access to these unique features, you’ll have to sign up and listen on Spotify to do so. Peer pressure works wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Invasive snails on the run leave behind DNA evidence </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mark Abramson, of Heal the Bay, displays a New Zealand mud snail on the tip of his little finger at" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OS-eEs3Onbkx7urVyQZyx85FmkA=/53x0:1948x1263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376714/566073327.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMfTv8"&gt;DNA sleuthing helped scientists spot early outcrops of a spreading snail invasion in Pennsylvania. The method could be used to spot the unwanted critters before they cause serious damage. That way, conservationists can stop them from conquering even more places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGF6zJ"&gt;New Zealand mud snails became a global pest in part because they can reproduce asexually — just one snail in a new area can essentially clone itself until there are 500,000 snails in a single square yard. They’re about the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;length of a pencil eraser so they’re hard to find until there are so many in a location that it’s nearly impossible to stop their spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZI03nk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It opens the door for us to be able to use this technology to detect the snail at a much wider scale”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FIS3oK"&gt;“It’s kind of weird because as an invasive ecologist, I never really want to find this thing,” says Edward Levri, a Pennsylvania State University-Altoona professor and senior author of a new &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-021-02576-7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Biological Invasions&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s sort of an exciting feeling, it opens the door for us to be able to use this technology to detect the snail at a much wider scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmxOug"&gt;Levri and his colleagues successfully used DNA present in the environment (something researchers call environmental DNA or eDNA) to track down the tiny snails. But over the past decade, Levri has spent a lot of time looking for the tiny rascals by turning over rocks and casting nets. “It is an arduous process, and there’s very limited success,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FRVYp"&gt;So this time, he worked with the lead study author James Woodell to collect water samples from eight different locations across Pennsylvania and scour them for the snails’ DNA. Just like humans slough off skin cells in the shower, snails shed DNA in the water. The researchers used a technique called a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to amplify small amounts of snail DNA found in water samples. They use a dye to make the DNA glow so that it can be spotted with a special machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Biologists led by the University of Iowa used a special technique called eDNA to discover an invasive species of tiny snails in streams in central Pennsylvania where the snails’ presence had been unknown.

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Edward Levri&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biologists led by the University of Iowa used a special technique called eDNA to discover an invasive species of tiny snails in streams in central Pennsylvania where the snails’ presence had been unknown. The invasive New Zealand mud snail has spread to the Eastern Seaboard after arriving in the western United States decades ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="okxCKo"&gt;They ultimately found eDNA from the mud snails in five of the eight locations they sampled. Levri has since been able to go back and find an actual New Zealand mud snail at one of those locations. He hasn’t yet found the snails at the other locations — he hasn’t been able to be out in the field as much as he’d like because of the pandemic. While there’s a possibility that some of the eDNA drifted there from other locations, Levri and co-authors hope the state will consider the eDNA findings as enough evidence to take action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jY1grc"&gt;“From the conservation perspective, that’s enough to say, ‘Hey, we should really be more careful with these sites,” says Maurine Neiman, an associate professor of biology at the University of Iowa and another one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3NlG9"&gt;The snails are small enough to hitch a ride on fishing gear unnoticed, which is one way they’ve been able to spread across the US and other parts of the world (they can also tag along on boats). The state could put signs up to warn people who fish at these locations to take extra precautions, like cleaning their waders with certain &lt;a href="https://www.fws.gov/columbiariver/ANS/factsheets/mudsnail.pdf"&gt;disinfectants&lt;/a&gt; before they visit a new fishing location&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(sticking them in the freezer overnight accomplishes the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1kPbFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These snails are tiny, but they seem to have the potential to pack a really big ecological punch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lYv0Ib"&gt;The New Zealand mud snail was first found in Pennsylvania in 2013 at Spring Creek, and now there are “millions” there, according to Levri. That’s bad news for the area’s fish and the people who like to catch them. The snails are difficult to digest and have been known to come out the other end of a fish alive after being eaten. Since they’re a poor source of nutrition, studies have shown that fish that eat them lose weight. The snails also crowd out native snails and aquatic insects. In some cases, the invasive snails make up 90 percent of the invertebrate biomass in a location. That’s “amazing for just one species to do,” says Levri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIo4qR"&gt;“These snails are tiny, but they seem to have the potential to pack a really big ecological punch to these invaded ecosystems,” Neiman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLjcKf"&gt;eDNA could help researchers find the snails a year or more sooner than they otherwise might have. That gives conservationists crucial time to stop the snails before people unwittingly give them a ride to other, snail-free locales. Conservationists haven’t been very successful in getting rid of the snails once they’ve shown up, Levri says, so that’s all the more reason to stop their spread in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Atkk7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZdvQS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valorant is the latest big shooter to get a mobile spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bnLd5oQGKxa5xug793iWlvXfLPc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376560/VALORANT_Viper.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMQuLZ"&gt;Riot is bringing its tactical shooter &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; to mobile devices. There aren’t a lot of details yet — such as when it will launch, on what hardware, or how it will differ from the main game — but Riot says the new version will simply be called &lt;em&gt;Valorant Mobile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4jtMu"&gt;The developer claims that the PC version of the game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21280796/valorant-riot-games-launch-overwatch-league-blizzard-esports-competitive-gaming"&gt;which launched last year&lt;/a&gt;, currently averages 14 million monthly players. Valorant is also coming off of its biggest competitive tournament to date, with an event in Iceland, and Riot says that more than 1 million concurrent viewers tuned in to the finals on May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFUxas"&gt;The news shouldn’t be too surprising. Earlier this year, Riot made a similar move with &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;launching a mobile-focused spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, some of the most popular shooters in the world have moved to smartphones as well; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are both huge hits, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391634/apex-legends-mobile-beta"&gt;a smartphone iteration of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN2tWT"&gt;It also sounds like Riot is looking to build out &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; in other ways. Without getting into details, aside from the mobile version, the developer says that it is “preparing to expand the franchise in order to bring &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; to more players around the world.” Again, this would be following the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; playbook, which currently has expanded into everything from comic books to digital card games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;an upcoming animated series on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky is getting a ‘visual overhaul’ and flying pets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uDZtxoeEMSc-F4xf7dSxyDkmX8U=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376568/No_Mans_Sky_Prisms_Screen_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0eFcw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is getting yet another big update, this time focused on the way the sci-fi adventure looks. The update is called “Prisms,” and developer Hello Games describes it as “a visual overhaul” of the game. It’s available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CS8p2c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:579707"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wG6bI"&gt;The changes include new weather effects, volumetric lighting, furry aliens, skies full of stars, and more. The studio also says that PC and next-gen versions of the game will get “detailed reflections, improved lighting quality, more detailed biomes, and more.” You can get a good rundown in the trailer above. As part of the update, &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is also getting a very cool new feature: flying pets that you can ride. These include giant beetles, flying worms, and huge butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qg5Jcv"&gt;As always, the update is available for free. Thanks to a steady stream of expansions, &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a vastly different game today compared to when it launched in 2016. This year alone has seen added features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22285801/no-mans-sky-companions-pets-update-hello-games"&gt;alien pets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22358926/no-mans-sky-expeditions-update-hello-games"&gt;a new quest structure&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22446499/no-mans-sky-mass-effect-normandy-starship"&gt;the Normandy starship from &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I broke off a tiny piece of the world with a self-flying drone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DXME7X7sOEMN5KMOK5u4oBHxpl0=/0x0:1766x1177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376551/skydio_3d_model.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4vAmLZ"&gt;With photogrammetry, hundreds of still photos can be transformed into an incredibly realistic 3D model of a real place on Earth — assuming you capture them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJh1u8"&gt;This Memorial Day weekend, a self-flying robot cameraman did that entire job for me. I simply designated where to fly and where not to fly, kicked back in a chair, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;Skydio 2 drone&lt;/a&gt; nabbed those photos all by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WyFqoqbLayUf2YkyctAyMB92Ifw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554185/skydio_scan_test_448.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQIi7G"&gt;Today, Skydio is launching &lt;a href="https://www.skydio.com/3d-scan"&gt;Skydio 3D Scan&lt;/a&gt;, an optional software suite for its self-flying drones that lets them build incredibly detailed models for &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more important tasks than my holiday backyard BBQ. We’re talking about scanning bridges that might be in need of structural repair, accident reporting at crash sites, and allowing clients to inspect construction sites from most any angle, anywhere in the world, during and after structures are built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEN172"&gt;Those aren’t theoretical, by the way: Skydio says the North Carolina Department of Transportation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;is using it for bridges&lt;/a&gt;; the Boston Police Department for crime and accident scene reconstruction; and, below, you can see an real-life interactive 3D example of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcv16-lLsA4"&gt;a water treatment plant for an upcoming semiconductor facility&lt;/a&gt; being built in Chandler, Arizona by Sundt Construction, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;presumably for Intel&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YiH4MC"&gt;As you can imagine with that kind of clientele, the feature doesn’t come cheap: $2,999 per year, per drone, for the ability to autonomously grab all those photos given a designated volume that you’d like to capture. That also doesn’t include the drone, a controller, or the software you’ll need to actually stitch the images together: $99+ a month for DroneDeploy, or &lt;a href="https://www.virtuosity.com/product/reality-modeling-worksuite/"&gt;several thousand dollars per year&lt;/a&gt; for Bentley Systems’ ContextCapture, as a couple examples — the embedded Sketchfab models in this post use Bentley’s solution. 3D Scan will come to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418785/skydio-enterprise-drones-x2-x2e-x2d-prices-specs"&gt;the company’s $10,999-and-up Skydio X2 drone&lt;/a&gt; later this summer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L799Un"&gt;Though it’s aimed at professionals with money to spend, a few short sessions showed me you don’t need to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a pro to use 3D Scan, or necessarily even know how to fly a drone. Assuming you’re following all local drone laws, it’s simply a matter of powering up a standard Skydio 2 drone (with two high-capacity microSD cards) and a Skydio controller, then following a series of prompts on a phone. You fly the drone to the top, bottom, and corners of the area you’d like to capture, pick how much detail you want, and then it does the rest on its own — taking pictures with its 12-megapixel front camera while the drone’s other six eyes and navigation system keep it from crashing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eb9eJgWR_KeONwxdlpXAIi9GGa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554227/skydio_scan_sean_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The larger and more detailed your scan, the longer it’ll take, but you can resume after a battery swap — Skydio recommends you don’t stay out longer than four batteries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ystn1"&gt;Like I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;in our Skydio 2 review&lt;/a&gt;, you can trust this drone not to crash, and the 3D Scan mode adds a geofencing feature that can help you keep it from flying into unwanted areas, too. Frankly, I didn’t feel a pressing need to hang onto the controller during my backyard patio scan, so I left it on a table while I watched. The only thing that confused me was knowing when the scan was done: it turns out you have to land the drone, then leave it powered on to finish processing. Then, it was a matter of uploading a couple gigabytes of photos to DroneDeploy or Bentley and waiting for them to process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajXHGtLzvmNORuTP9pJ8bGoNGlU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554226/skydio_scan_sean_004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an AR mode where you can keep track of a virtual Skydio drone as it makes its rounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PKam8Y"&gt;As you’ll no doubt see in the 3D models (or failing that, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcv16-lLsA4"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;), they’re not quite seamless yet — not something you’d want to explore in virtual reality, for instance. (I tried.) Even though I can make out the exact texture of the cement slab and tiles in my backyard, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2F3d-models%2Fmock-helicopter-crash-scene-a9691d3134f04b63bfe57159965d22eb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F2%2F22464280%2Fskydio-2-x2-3d-scan-photogrammetry" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the metal carnage in this Swiss cheese of a busted helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, here are loads of holes and smudges that photogrammetry is just failing to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxfNFR"&gt;Skydio CEO and co-founder Adam Bry admits that 3D isn’t everything, and that some clients will simply use 3D as a guide to all of the individual high-res photos that Skydio also provides. “If you set the closest resolution, you’re talking about something like .5mm per pixel ... it’s enough to see fine cracks in concrete, it’s enough to see rust on a bolt, it’s enough to see details of a skid mark on the ground.” And while he says the system works in indoor environments, it’s currently optimized for flying &lt;em&gt;around &lt;/em&gt;an object you’d like to capture instead of capturing the world around the drone, like you might for an indoor tour. (Skydio is “fairly active” in pursuing inside-out capture as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XMnz5d"&gt;Long term, Bry thinks the automated aerial scanning might come in handy for digitizing the world for other reasons, like augmented and virtual reality, but for now it seemed like simple, detailed 3D structure modeling was a problem Skydio could solve. “There are countless examples of the world’s best drone pilots keeping this mental model of the path they’ve flown,” says Bry. Now, scanning may not need to be about flying, or even programming a path on a map. It’s just another app on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0HcZ1"&gt;Skydio’s holding a special live webinar at the US Space and Rocket Center today at 9AM PT / 12PM ET to show a bit more of what 3D Scan can do. They’ll be scanning some exhibits inside the center, Bry tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti review: more 4K for more of your wallet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Nvidia goes back to 4K for more than $1K&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wpH0tU"&gt;Last year’s Nvidia RTX 3080 was the first GPU to make 4K gaming finally feasible. It was a card that delivered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;impressive performance at 4K&lt;/a&gt;, especially for its retail price of $699 — far less than the 2080 Ti cost a generation earlier. That was before the reality of a global chip shortage drove the prices of modern GPUs well above $1,000. Now that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;street prices of RTX 3080s have stayed above $2,000&lt;/a&gt; for months, Nvidia is launching its RTX 3080 Ti flagship priced at $1,199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyGx46"&gt;It’s a card that aims to deliver near identical levels of performance to the $1,499 RTX 3090, but in a smaller package and with just 12GB of VRAM — half what’s found on the RTX 3090. Nvidia is effectively competing with itself here, and now offering three cards at the top end. That’s if you can even manage to buy any of them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YR5oXC"&gt;I’ve spent the past week testing the RTX 3080 Ti at both 4K and 1440p resolutions. 4K gaming might have arrived originally with the RTX 2080 Ti, but the RTX 3080 Ti refines it and offers more headroom in the latest games. Unfortunately, it does so with a $1,199 price tag that I think will be beyond most people’s budgets even before you factor in the inevitable street price markup it will see during the current GPU shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="azHe6g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10528849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JZsMT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VDgeGo"&gt;If you put the RTX 3080 Ti and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; side by side, it would be difficult to tell the difference between them. They look identical, with the same ports and fan setup. I’m actually surprised this card isn’t a three-slot like the RTX 3090, or just bigger generally. The RTX 3080 Ti has one fan on either side of the card, with a push-pull system in place. The bottom fan pulls cool air into the card, which then exhausts on the opposite side that’s closest to your CPU cooler and rear case fan. A traditional blower cooler also exhausts the hot air out of the PCIe slot at the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwbevl"&gt;This helped create a quieter card on the original RTX 3080, and I’m happy to report it’s the same with the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 3080 Ti runs at or close to its max fan RPM under heavy loads, but the hum of the fans isn’t too distracting. I personally own an RTX 3090, and while the fans rarely kick in at full speed, they’re certainly a lot more noticeable than the RTX 3080 Ti’s.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lnXv1AYl8_3-KO7609hM8N_vK8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553300/twarren_20210601_4611_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HNKVRBYh7T2FeB7eGxL73YVvQmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553307/twarren_20210601_4611_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia has used the same RTX 3080 design for the 3080 Ti Model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AWsjfx"&gt;That quiet performance might have a downside, though. During my week of testing with the RTX 3080 Ti, I noticed that the card seems to run rather hot. I recorded temperatures regularly around 80 degrees Celsius, compared to the 70 degrees Celsius temperatures on the larger RTX 3090. The fans also maxed out a lot during demanding 4K games on the RTX 3080 Ti in order to keep the card cool. I don’t have the necessary equipment to fully measure the heat output here, but when I went to swap the RTX 3080 Ti for another card after hours of testing, it was too hot to touch, and stayed hotter for longer than I’d noticed with either the RTX 3080 or RTX 3090. I’m not sure if this will result in problems in the long term, as we saw with the initial batch of 2080 Ti units having memory overheating issues, but most people will put this in a case and never touch it again. Still, I’m surprised at how long it stayed hot enough for me to not want to touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncSUUK"&gt;As this is a Founders Edition card, Nvidia is using its latest 12-pin single power connector. There’s an ugly and awkward adapter in the box that lets you connect two eight-pin PCIe power connectors to it, but I’d highly recommend getting a single new cable from your PSU supplier to connect directly to this card. It’s less cabling, and a more elegant solution if you have a case window or you’re addicted to tidy cable management (hello, that’s me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hh2v5IyxZ02bGciCADi3lkwg0VA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553012/rtx3080ticase_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti inside my case.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O13Vyi"&gt;I love the look of the RTX 3080 Ti and the pennant-shaped board that Nvidia uses here. Just like the RTX 3080, there are no visible screws, and the regulatory notices are all on the output part of the card so there are no ugly stickers or FCC logos. It’s a really clean card, and I’m sorry to bring this up, but Nvidia has even fixed the way the number 8 is displayed. It was a minor mistake on the RTX 3080, but I’m glad the 8 has the correct proportions on the RTX 3080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Qye70"&gt;At the back of the card there’s a single HDMI 2.1 port and three DisplayPort 1.4a ports. Just like the RTX 3080, there are also LEDs that glow around the top part of the fan, and the GeForce RTX branding lights up, too. You can even customize the colors of the glowing part around the fan if you’re really into RGB lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFLy7N"&gt;Just like the RTX 3080, this new RTX 3080 Ti needs a 750W power supply. The RTX 3080 Ti even draws more power, too, at up to 350 watts under load compared to 320 watts on the RTX 3080. That’s the same amount of power draw as the larger RTX 3090, which is understandable given the performance improvements, but it’s worth being aware of how this might impact your energy bills (and the cost of your PC build to run it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uTuouH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1440p testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="pCan71"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10528861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDWh4p"&gt;I’ve been testing the RTX 3080 Ti with Intel’s latest Core i9 processor. For 1440p tests, I’ve also paired the GPU with a 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G7 monitor. This monitor supports refresh rates up to 240Hz, as well as Nvidia’s G-Sync technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVggVm"&gt;I compared the RTX 3080 Ti against both the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 to really understand where it fits into Nvidia’s new lineup. I tested a variety of AAA titles, including &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and many more. You can also find the same games tested at 4K resolution below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy8DTE"&gt;All games were tested at max or ultra settings on the RTX 3080 Ti, and most exceeded an average of 100fps at 1440p. On paper, the RTX 3080 Ti is very close to an RTX 3090, and my testing showed that plays out in most games at 1440p. Games like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; all have near-identical performance across the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QxGRf"&gt;Even &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; is the same without Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology enabled, and it’s only really games like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; where there’s a noteworthy, but small, gap in performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLCzDZ"&gt;However, the jump in performance from the RTX 3080 to the RTX 3080 Ti is noticeable across nearly every game, with the exception of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which both perform really well on the base RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8xmiGM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10528841"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PokWOs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; performs 15 percent better on the RTX 3080 Ti over the regular RTX 3080, and Metro Exodus also shows a 14 percent improvement. The range of performance increases ranges from around 4 percent all the way up to 15 percent, so the performance gap is very game dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPz7Pr"&gt;Even when using games with ray tracing, the RTX 3080 Ti still managed high frame rates when paired with DLSS. DLSS uses neural networks and AI supercomputers to analyze games and sharpen or clean up images at lower resolutions. In simple terms, it allows a game to render at a lower resolution and use Nvidia’s image reconstruction technique to upscale the image and make it look as good as native 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I370eQ"&gt;Whenever I see the DLSS option in games, I immediately turn it on now to get as much performance as possible. It’s still very much required for ray tracing games, particularly as titles like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; only manage to hit 55fps with ultra ray tracing enabled. If you enable DLSS, this jumps to 72fps and it’s difficult to notice a hit in image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxNLYvsSBuGGQQQCI5UGUMUYeBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553303/twarren_20210601_4611_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti stays quiet during heavy loads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fuzDsT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4K testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EL5Hu5"&gt;For my 4K testing, I paired the RTX 3080 Ti with Acer’s 27-inch Nitro XV273K, a 4K monitor that offers up to 144Hz refresh rates and supports G-Sync. I wasn’t able to get any of the games I tested on both the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 to hit the frame rates necessary to really take advantage of this 144Hz panel, but some came close thanks to DLSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fl9tbH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; manages a 14 percent improvement over the RTX 3080, and &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; also sees a 13 percent jump. Elsewhere, other games see between a 4 and 9 percent improvement. These are solid gains for the RTX 3080 Ti, providing more headroom for 4K gaming over the original RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glZ3xK"&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti comes close to matching the RTX 3090 performance at 4K in games like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;. Neither the RTX 3080 Ti nor RTX 3090 is strong enough to handle &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing, though. Both cards manage around 30fps on average, and even DLSS only bumps this up to below 50fps averages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nh28aS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10528843"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ddaScg"&gt;Most games manage to comfortably rise above 60fps in 4K at ultra settings, with &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; as the only exceptions. Not even the RTX 3090 could reliably push beyond 144fps at 4K without assistance from DLSS or a drop in visual settings. I think we’re going to be waiting on whatever Nvidia does next to really push 4K at these types of frame rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akddde"&gt;When you start to add ray tracing and ultra 4K settings, it’s clear that both the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3090 need to have DLSS enabled to play at reasonable frame rates across the most demanding ray-traced titles. Without DLSS, &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; manages an average of 29fps (at max settings), with dips below that making the game unplayable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jm0hg8"&gt;DLSS really is the key here across both 1440p and 4K. It was merely a promise when the 2080 Ti debuted nearly three years ago, but Nvidia has now managed to get DLSS into more than 50 popular games. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six Siege &lt;/em&gt;are getting DLSS support soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCclsJ"&gt;DLSS also sets Nvidia apart from AMD’s cards. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;AMD’s RX 6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; is fairly competitive at basic rasterization at 1440p, it falls behind the RTX 3080 in the most demanding games at 4K — particularly when ray tracing is enabled. Even the $1,000 Radeon RX 6900 XT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163537/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review-roundup"&gt;doesn’t fare much better at 4K&lt;/a&gt;. AMD’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462659/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-release-date"&gt;answer to DLSS is coming later this month&lt;/a&gt;, but until it arrives we still don’t know exactly how it will compensate for ray tracing performance on AMD’s GPUs. AMD has also struggled to supply retailers with stock of its cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nipbWn"&gt;That’s left Nvidia in a position to launch the RTX 3080 Ti at a price point that really means it’s competing with itself, positioned between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. If the RTX 3090 wasn’t a thing, the RTX 3080 Ti would make a lot more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dSZfGx5PxCAlNYhOiE5WbqB_K0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553306/twarren_20210601_4611_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti comes close to RTX 3090 performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vzizDg"&gt;Nvidia is also competing with the reality of the market right now, as demand has been outpacing supply for more than six months. Nvidia has introduced a hash rate limiter for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining on new versions of the RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and now this RTX 3080 Ti. It could help deter some scalpers, but we’ll need months of data on street prices to really understand if it’s driven pricing down to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4D6Q6o"&gt;Demand for 30-series cards has skyrocketed as many rush to replace their aging GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti cards. Coupled with Nvidia’s NVENC and professional tooling support, it’s also made the RTX 30-series a great option for creators looking to stream games, edit videos, or build games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgdYur"&gt;In a normal market, I would only recommend the RTX 3080 Ti if you’re really willing to spend an extra $500 to get some extra gains in 1440p and 4K performance. But it’s a big price premium when the RTX 3090 exists at this niche end of the market and offers more performance and double the VRAM if you’re really willing to pay this much for a graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKn2oF"&gt;At $999 or even $1,099, the RTX 3080 Ti would tempt me &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more, but $1,199 feels a little too pricey. For most people, an RTX 3080 makes a lot more sense if it were actually available at its standard retail price. Nvidia also has a $599 RTX 3070 Ti on the way next week, which could offer some performance gains to rival the RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SYoio1"&gt;Either way, the best GPU is the one you can buy right now, and let’s hope that Nvidia and AMD manage to make that a reality soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch, Fitbit users with heart conditions get more medical procedures</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2J9zAn"&gt;People with irregular heartbeats who use wearable devices like Apple Watches and Fitbits aren’t overwhelming doctors with worried calls about their hearts, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780408"&gt;new study shows&lt;/a&gt;. But they are more likely to be treated with a heart procedure called an ablation, the analysis found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8OKAk"&gt;The small&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study is one of the first to show how people with existing heart problems use wearables. Devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850660/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-electrocardiogram-health-2018"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; have a heart-monitoring feature that can alert users if they have an irregular pulse. Technically, those features on the Apple Watch are only authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people who &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have underlying heart conditions. But people with heart conditions, including a type of abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, are still able to buy the watch and use those same features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXR9zv"&gt;Cardiologists regularly see patients who have been diagnosed with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;atrial fibrillation bring in data from an Apple Watch or Fitbit, says study author Libo Wang, a cardiology fellow at the University of Utah School of Medicine. “There are a good amount of patients who are using these wearables outside of the FDA cleared indication,” he says. “That was sort of the motivation to start, not raising the alarm, but raising questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iTCdB"&gt;When companies like Apple ask the FDA to authorize a medical device, most of the focus is on making sure that the device does what it promises it can do — without producing too many false positives or negatives. There’s less focus on what users and doctors do with the information. That’s what researchers are studying&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;now, and this new study took an early look at what wearables can mean for people with atrial fibrillation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFCQhi"&gt;The study looked at 125 people with atrial fibrillation who visited University of Utah Health during a 90-day period and who mentioned using a wearable including an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. The team compared them to a group of 500 people with the same condition who didn’t use a wearable but had similar characteristics — including age, socioeconomic status, and the amount of times they typically went to see a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyJ4Wp"&gt;“The people who were wearing wearables didn’t necessarily call into the office more,” Wang says. That was a welcome surprise, he says: many doctors were worried that they’d get more calls from worried patients who had on a device like an Apple Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEOAEs"&gt;Over the 90 days, the group using wearables had a similar average pulse rate as the group that did not — indicating that they ended up with around the same average heart health. But people with wearables did have more medical procedures done during those three months. Specifically, this group was more likely to have an ablation, a type of procedure that creates scars in the heart to restore a normal heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3O7ouU"&gt;The study is small, and just looks at patient visits from one hospital. It also&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;can’t answer the chicken-or-egg question: it’s not clear from this study if the people who wore wearables and had ablations actually had more severe symptoms than the control group and needed the treatment, or if the wearables nudged them to see a doctor prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgZRzP"&gt;It may be that people with heart conditions who decide to buy an Apple Watch do it because they’re feeling more symptoms and want a good way to flag that to a doctor, Wang says. “That may be appropriate, and they may be benefiting from the ‘extra’ ablation.”  Alternatively, patients could see their watch flagging an abnormal heartbeat and worry that their atrial fibrillation is getting worse — even when it isn’t. “That may be a waste of time and risk to the patient,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRYL3C"&gt;Earlier research found that the Apple Watch’s heart feature led to unnecessary doctor’s visits for people who &lt;em&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;have an underlying heart condition. Only 10 percent of people who visited their doctor after getting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an alert from their watch went on to get a new cardiac diagnosis, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYkfHP"&gt;There’s more data on wearables in people without underlying conditions than people with underlying conditions because that’s the group the Apple Watch’s heart monitor was originally tested on. But cardiologists need more information about what the devices mean for people with atrial fibrillation, Wang says — these patients are already using them, and some doctors are even encouraging patients to wear one. He hopes further research can offer more conclusive answers. “We need more clarification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTau8J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS smartwatch  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5WZ1-h_51CjfAOxicSrxfdcoCcc=/0x2:3424x2285/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376245/MKT_HUAWEI_WATCH_3_crop_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei Watch 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GnKvGW"&gt;Huawei has announced its first smartwatches running its own HarmonyOS operating system, the Huawei Watch 3 and Huawei Watch 3 Pro. In theory it’s the third separate operating system Huawei has used for its smartwatches, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/25/9397931/huawei-watch-review-android-wear"&gt;originally ran Google’s Android Wear&lt;/a&gt; (now Wear OS) before introducing its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967136/huawei-watch-gt-fitness-gps-watch-specs-release-date-price-hands-on"&gt;LiteOS software&lt;/a&gt; with more recent devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXiI7C"&gt;Despite the new OS, the Watch 3 offers a similar set of features to Huawei’s previous wearables. New additions includes a redesigned home screen that now consists of a watchOS-style grid of apps rather than a list (though you’re free to switch back to a list if you prefer), and there’s also support for video calling through Huawei’s own MeeTime service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaTaJ9"&gt;Although it’s branded as a HarmonyOS device, the Watch 3’s long battery life suggests its operating system is significantly different from the version of HarmonyOS Huawei is using on its new tablets, and may have more in common with LiteOS on its previous watches. Huawei did not respond to questions about any similarities between HarmonyOS and its existing operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WG0FzI3qx0kbPACiKS26zipB0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554442/1lopY6TxET.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Watch 3 is available in four different styles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fT05po"&gt;The Watch 3’s design doesn’t deviate much from Huawei’s previous smart watches. It’s got a circular 1.43-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 1000 nits. The display is edge-to-edge, so there’s no rotating bezel on this smartwatch. Instead you control it via a rotating crown, similar to an Apple Watch. The watch is available in a couple of different styles including an “active” model with a rubber strap, a “classic” model with leather, and an “elite” version with a metal bracelet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UuHKk1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With a 1.43-inch circular OLED display and a rotating crown&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHH0JG"&gt;For activity tracking, the watch features many of the same sensors as previous models, including heart rate tracking, an Sp02 sensor, and sleep tracking. But new for this version is a temperature sensor, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;Fitbit’s Sense smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; from last year. Huawei says this sensor can continuously track the temperature of your skin throughout the course of the day. Huawei says the watch supports a hundred different workout modes, ranging from running to climbing, cycling, and swimming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LMqXl"&gt;eSIM support returns from the Watch 2 Pro, which means the Watch 3 can also be operated independently from a phone with its own 4G LTE connection. The watch supports making voice calls directly, and there’s also support for video calls via Huawei’s MeeTime service (though there wasn’t any confirmation about whether the watch will work with other video calling services like WhatsApp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxAc8A"&gt;With 4G turned on, Huawei says you should get around three days of battery life from the Watch 3, but that extends to 14 days if you’re willing to turn off 4G and use the phone in “ultra long lasting mode.” Even in this low-power mode, Huawei says you should still be able to track your activity and workouts, and its watch faces will still be animated. When it’s time to charge, the Watch 3 supports Qi wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DIBsGVh68Z9wd4OUqQ6x8sufaTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554458/U3GSZejh25.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei Watch Pro 3 has better battery life and more accurate location tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fVKlZQ"&gt;As well as the Watch 3, Huawei is also announcing the Watch 3 Pro today, which offers up to 5 days of battery life with 4G turned on, and up to 21 days in its long battery life mode. Other improvements include a more premium titanium construction, and more accurate GPS tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DQtGD"&gt;Third-party app support is still a big question mark hanging over Huawei’s first HarmonyOS watches. As always, Huawei promises it’s working with developers on bringing their apps to its devices, and showed off a range of app logos including one for the Emirates airline. But beyond that, there weren’t any app logos for services I recognized, and Huawei hasn’t confirmed support from any of the major music streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkOiIL"&gt;The Huawei Watch 3 will cost £349.99 in the UK, where it releases on June 18th. Meanwhile, the Huawei Watch 3 Pro will cost £499.99 and will be available from June 28th in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9j3RC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 2nd, 8:39AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added UK pricing and release info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDQORn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mm7blU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro with stylus and keyboard cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3m61Jb"&gt;Huawei has announced a trio of new MatePad tablets; a new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, a smaller 10.8-inch MatePad Pro, and a new MatePad 11. Not only are they the company’s first tablets running its own HarmonyOS operating system, but the smaller MatePad Pro and MatePad 11 use Snapdragon chips produced by Qualcomm rather than the Huawei-designed Kirin processors found in its previous devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJa5An"&gt;Between these hardware and software changes, the tablets highlight the challenges that the Chinese technology giant is going through. It’s simultaneously trying to break free of Android, which outside of China is dominated by the Google apps and services that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;Huawei is unable to preinstall on its phones&lt;/a&gt;. But they also speak to the problems US sanctions are causing for Huawei’s Kirin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;processor production&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones"&gt;source chips from competitor Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FCjDZv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two of the new tablets use Qualcomm chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOkjwg"&gt;The 10.8-inch MatePad Pro is equipped with a Snapdragon 870, while the 10.95-inch MatePad 11 is powered by a Snapdragon 865. The flagship 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, meanwhile, is still running Huawei’s own Kirin 9000E processor, and it’s the device Huawei has shared the most information about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5tbEN"&gt;But more interesting than the chips inside is the software these new tablets are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1EloB"&gt;From an end user point of view, the “switch” to HarmonyOS fundamentally doesn’t bring back the missing Google apps and services that have made Huawei’s recent devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;so difficult to recommend&lt;/a&gt; outside of China. Huawei’s AppGallery store offers an increasing array of native apps, and workarounds for some others, but it’s still a far cry from having Google’s suite of apps and services pre-installed on a device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNymVE"&gt;There have been big questions surrounding HarmonyOS ever since an &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; alleged that it’s a glorified open-source Android fork. I can’t speak to its underlying code, but I was able to download &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/android/"&gt;WhatsApp’s official Android APK&lt;/a&gt; and install it on the new MatePad Pro as though I was using an Android device, which suggests &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; is correct. Huawei did not respond to my questions about shared code between HarmonyOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9yG3g5B3jEUM0IrmRkSkITTdXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552890/jporter_20210601_4610_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 12.6-inch MatePad Pro’s webcam is in the bezel on the tablet’s long side, the right place for video calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hutwPr"&gt;With its keyboard cover and M-Pencil stylus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145754/huawei-matepad-pro-5g-tablet-wireless-charging-specs-news-features"&gt;last year’s MatePad Pro&lt;/a&gt; invited obvious comparisons to Apple’s iPad Pro, and this year’s HarmonyOS model packs in a few more features that are eerily reminiscent of Apple’s tablets. There’s a new FreeNote feature that lets you use the M-Pencil to write into dialog boxes and see your handwriting automatically turned into typed text (a feature which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294662/apple-ipados-14-scribble-pencil-handwriting-typed-text-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple introduced last year&lt;/a&gt;) and the tablet’s homescreen now includes a dock with your most used apps (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650197/apple-ipad-os-ipados-multitasking-homescreen-features-wwdc-2019"&gt;ahem&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spXudY"&gt;But with the 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, Huawei deserves some credit for not imitating some of Apple’s less popular design decisions. Its webcam, for example, is built into the bezel on the long edge of the screen, so it’s in the right place for conference calls made in landscape mode, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor#:~:text=I%E2%80%99d,their%20faces"&gt;unlike the iPad Pro’s&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also got a vibrant 1600 x 2560 OLED screen with excellent black levels, while Apple’s lineup is still using variations of LCD panels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQJ4p8wfn9t16shDTQbTOyBW1Io=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552891/jporter_20210601_4610_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also announced today is a new M-Pencil stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ORtlxU"&gt;Huawei’s screen-mirroring technology also returns with the new MatePad Pro. While this previously let you mirror a smartphone’s screen onto the tablet, now you can mirror and interact with the tablet’s screen on compatible Huawei laptops, or use it as an external display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP7cCe"&gt;The 12.6-inch MatePad Pro has a 10,050mAh battery which Huawei claims can playback video for 14 hours on a single charge. It can be fast-charged at up to 40W with a cable, 27W wirelessly, and also offers reverse wireless charging at 10W. Rounding out the specs, there are three rear cameras on the tablet, four mics, eight speakers, Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, and optional 5G support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fctyhg"&gt;Alongside the new tablets, Huawei is also announcing a second-generation of its M-Pencil stylus. The company says the new stylus is more precise, has lower 9ms latency, and also has a platinum-coated transparent nib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnVcbj"&gt;Huawei is yet to confirm pricing or release details for its new tablets in Europe, but said the 12.6-inch MatePad Pro would release in China on June 10th, starting at 4999 yuan (around $783) for the 128GB Wi-Fi model. Meanwhile the 10.8-inch MatePad Pro will start at 3799 yuan (around $595) for the 128GB model and will release on June 10th in China. Huawei didn’t provide exact pricing or release info for the MatePad 11. The second generation M-Pencil will go on sale in China for 599 yuan (around $94) on June 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugl3qJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 2nd, 9:27AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Chinese pricing and release information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
