    <title>ZTE’s S21 competitor arrives in June for $749</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anuhJR"&gt;ZTE announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22384596/zte-axon-30-ultra-5g-specs-launch-us"&gt;Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other devices&lt;/a&gt; last month, and today reveals that the Ultra will go on sale June 4th starting at $749 / €749. Preorders begin &lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/"&gt;directly through ZTE’s website&lt;/a&gt; on May 27th and include a free pair of ZTE’s Livebuds TWS earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSwaoC"&gt;While ZTE has tried some more adventurous things in its other devices that have missed the mark — an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16667508/zte-axon-m-dual-screen-smartphone-review"&gt;early attempt at a dual-screen phone&lt;/a&gt; and the world’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; for starters — the company is playing it straight with the Axon 30 Ultra. The phone is outfitted with cameras aplenty and high-end features, including a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor and a large 144Hz fast refresh rate display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAKyR5"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s sub-$800 price tag positions it to undercut the $800 Samsung S21 and $1000 S21 Plus by a little or a lot, depending on which model you’re looking at and how deeply it’s discounted. Buyers in the US should be aware, though — the Axon 30 Ultra will only work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is limited to one band (B41) on T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford will start rolling out major over-the-air software updates to its vehicles this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEBknvwuPun3bLoO1MIP5uGHbqM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279577/sokane_210125_4386_1929.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVNRXx"&gt;Ford is finally ready to start rolling out over-the-air (OTA) software updates to its vehicles at scale. While Tesla and other automakers have offered OTA updates for years, Ford only delivered its first software updates to select Ford F-150 and Mustang Mach-E customers this year. But the automaker says it’s prepared to rapidly increase the number of vehicles capable of receiving software updates, with the goal of producing 33 million vehicles with the capability by 2028. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLVFyM"&gt;Ford, which is fond of nonsensically attaching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12846440/ford-tough-ford-trucks-ford-tough-ford-tough-truck-ford"&gt;the phrase “Built Ford Tough”&lt;/a&gt; to its products, is playing it cool with the branding this time, simply calling its software updates “Ford Power Ups.” Over the past two months, Ford says over 100,000 F-150 and Mach-E customers have received their first OTA updates. And there will be more to come, including owners of the new Ford Bronco. The automaker is preparing a major update later this year that will include Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AzIBTu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over 100,000 F-150 and Mach-E customers have already received their first OTA updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyRWpG"&gt;With this new update, Ford owners can ask Alexa for a weather update, play music, find the nearest gas station, or provide directions to their favorite destinations. Over 700,000 vehicles in the US and Canada will be eligible for the Alexa update this year, with “millions” more added over the next few years, Ford said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUoSl4"&gt;This isn’t exactly new for some Ford owners. Customers with Alexa accounts have been able to mirror the smart home assistant in their cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/1/15438554/2017-ford-fusion-energi-alexa-sync3-review"&gt;via their smartphones’ mobile connection and data processor since 2017&lt;/a&gt;. This new software update, though, will “embed” Alexa inside the car’s operating system, allowing for a more integrated user experience. And Ford is offering three years of Alexa complimentary, after which subscription fees will kick in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gnSaHE6TNrxrw3DSTyXgpOf0iSM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22510191/F150_Amazon_Alexa_Built_in_01.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXKkuR"&gt;“That experience is a decent one, though it’s not a north star, friction-free experience,” said Ned Curic, vice president of Amazon Alexa Automotive, of the earlier mobile version of Alexa. After the software update, Alexa will be “fully embedded” in Ford vehicles, which should make it a more “delightful experience” for customers, Curic added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvDgTA"&gt;Ford isn’t completely embracing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/2/17413732/tesla-over-the-air-software-updates-brakes"&gt;Tesla ethos&lt;/a&gt; of offering quirky software updates like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199963/tesla-holiday-update-fart-sound-horn-goat-boombox"&gt;fart sounds&lt;/a&gt;. But the automaker is pushing one update later this year that will allow customers to draw and sketch on their vehicle’s touchscreen. Ford said it is exploring ways for customers to share their in-car drawings on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbfjQ4"&gt;The updates won’t just apply to the vehicle’s infotainment system. Ford said it is building out the capability to push updates for up to 110 computer modules within the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HVA1Y-swX2On9qtHjoLoKynfSxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22510218/Ford_Sketch_dark_hidden_easter_egg_02.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf27aJ"&gt;Not all the updates will come for free. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;BlueCruise&lt;/a&gt;, the automaker’s “hands free” highway driving assist system, will be available later this year to select F-150 and Mach-E customers who have purchased the relevant software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Po0Go"&gt;It is certainly the case that legacy automakers have struggled to catch up to Tesla, which has long been the leader in shipping over-the-air updates to its customers to change everything from its Autopilot driver assistance system to the layout and look of its infotainment touchscreen. The idea that a car can be updated similarly to how Apple or Samsung can upgrade or repair the software on a smartphone has proven to be difficult and elusive for most car companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SCy617"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Legacy automakers are still struggling to catch up to Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hut5Fq"&gt;Most car dealers are wary of OTA updates for fear of being cut out of the lucrative service and maintenance process. Basically, if you can fix your car with an OTA update, you don’t need to take it in to the dealership as often. And that means less money for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QsmEe"&gt;Ford said that most of the updates will be “virtually invisible” to its customers and require “little to no action.” Others will require a reboot of the vehicle’s operating system that can be scheduled when it’s most convenient, like overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTVDDk"&gt;“It’s a total reversal of the ownership model where vehicles used to just get older,” said Alex Purdy, head of business operations. “Now Fords will actually get better over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5p9Nc"&gt;Earlier this year, Ford announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;Google’s Android would be used&lt;/a&gt; to power the infotainment systems in “millions” of its cars starting in 2023. That, along with the Alexa software update that will begin rolling out later this year, is proof that Ford is committed to “giving our customers the choice to stick with the technologies and brands they’re already using and love or to try something new,” Purdy said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram blames ‘enforcement error’ for removal of posts about Al-Aqsa Mosque</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QAYsRZLLifV3f5_IUhgzFNGYMCQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279559/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Jj3EY"&gt;Instagram removed and restricted posts related to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem after its moderators confused its name with a group designated as a terrorist organization. In an internal company message &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/instagram-facebook-censored-al-aqsa-mosque"&gt;first obtained by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lead on the company’s Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy team called the removals “enforcement errors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Ke6p"&gt;Facebook, which owns Instagram, provided a copy of the internal post to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In it, the employee wrote: “While Al-Aqsa (الأقصى) refers to a location, it is also unfortunately included in the names of several restricted organizations - by itself, however, this term should not and does not violate our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJuwv1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;News &lt;/em&gt;reports that there is an armed group known as the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades which is deemed a terrorist entity by the United States and European Union, and other groups with similar names are considered parts of its support network by the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8ZmtD"&gt;Removal of the posts comes as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites, has been at the center of clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians. It’s part of a wider escalating crisis that has claimed the lives of at least 72 people in Gaza, including 16 children, and seven people in Israel, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/13/israel-gaza-airstrikes-rockets-hamas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. When trying to share footage highlighting the violence at the mosque, Instagram users found that their posts were being restricted from view or were being removed entirely, according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CABrGz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The blocked hashtag is "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlAqsa?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AlAqsa&lt;/a&gt;" written in Arabic, the third holiest mosque in Islam that Palestinian folks got stun-grenaded &amp;amp; tear-gassed at during their Ramadan prayer earlier today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like blocking "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StatueOfLiberty?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StatueOfLiberty&lt;/a&gt;" when police are brutalizing innocent people there. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nLkoL6xr9R"&gt;https://t.co/nLkoL6xr9R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rami Ismail (رامي) (@tha_rami) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1390881708531142656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o5PdC0"&gt;“To be clear - we have never designated the Al-Aqsa Mosque under our Dangerous Organizations policy, but rather an organization with the name ‘Al-Aqsa,’” the internal Facebook post said. “[A]ny removals based solely on a mention of the name of the mosque are certainly enforcement errors and they never should have happened under our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NWumg"&gt;The post goes on to say that Facebook has a legal obligation to remove posts that support or represent organizations sanctioned by the US, although it will not remove news reporting or condemnation of such groups. The employee said Facebook was updating its guidance to moderators, that it had removed the term “Al-Aqsa” from its moderation list, and that it has replaced it with a more descriptive alias of the sanctioned organization.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon and WNBA strike multi-year streaming deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2021 Las Vegas Aces Media Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vatTTxs16Q2qVZO8t56q39Jy9d0=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278679/1232727770.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeff Bottari/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgqYlQ"&gt;Amazon and the Women’s National Basketball Association have &lt;a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/amazon-and-the-wnba-reach-multi-year-deal-to-stream-16-regular-season-games-and-the-commissioners-cup-championship-on-prime-video/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a multi-year deal that’ll see several games streamed live on Prime Video. It’s the first time Amazon has ever secured exclusive Prime Video rights to pro basketball, following earlier forays into streaming sports content like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17437248/amazon-premier-league-football-streaming-rights"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon’s Twitch has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757665/twitch-international-streaming-partner-usa-basketball-nba"&gt;partnered with USA Basketball&lt;/a&gt; to stream international games from events like the FIBA World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCsTdd"&gt;The WNBA deal includes exclusive international streaming rights for 16 regular season games, as well as the inaugural Commissioner’s Cup game taking place on August 12. The WNBA says this “marks the first time Prime Video has exclusive global streaming rights to a women’s professional sports league,” but the rights don’t extend to every country — China, Japan, the UK, Italy, Spain, Finland, and Germany are all left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoTmMz"&gt;Here’s the schedule of regular season games coming to Prime Video this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7yqUTA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday, May 29 – Atlanta @ New York, 2 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gbrRm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday, June 4 – Dallas @ Seattle, 10 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jI384j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday, June 12 – Chicago @ Indiana, 1 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEvI4L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday, June 16 – Phoenix @ Los Angeles, 10:30 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VEemiD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday, June 22 – Chicago @ New York, 7 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HwpWsE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday, June 30 – Las Vegas @ Los Angeles, 10:30 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iIcKxo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday, July 1 – Connecticut @ Indiana, 7 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DcPW6l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wednesday, July 7 – Phoenix @ Las Vegas, 10 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5ckzkz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday, July 10 – Washington @ Chicago, 8 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y2AiXV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday, August 17 – Minnesota @ Connecticut, 7 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tYgSqn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday, August 20 – Seattle @ New York, 7 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ddpv2s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday, August 26 – Dallas @ Washington, 7 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GBkAzU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday, August 31 – New York @ Minnesota, 8 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NCGMRx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday, September 2 – New York @ Seattle, 10 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NX5113"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday, September 7 – Connecticut @ Dallas, 8 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z64ETK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thursday, September 16 – Los Angeles @ Atlanta, 7 p.m. ET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="y4GrZh"&gt;The WNBA has experimented with several streaming platforms, as well as offering access to live games through its own League Pass service, which is similar to the NBA’s. Beyond Prime Video, the upcoming season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419249/wnba-stream-games-twitter-facebook-oculus-paramount-plus-google"&gt;will feature games streaming&lt;/a&gt; on platforms as diverse as Oculus, Facebook Watch, Paramount Plus, and ESPN’s various apps and networks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Misogynistic’ Apple hire is out hours after employees call for investigation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLsZb23Cc8zgyuyHYIKBzplj7UE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278358/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIq2dM"&gt;Antonio García Martínez is no longer working at Apple hours after employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;circulated a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling for an investigation into his hiring. Martínez, a former Facebook product manager on the ad targeting team, authored a controversial book about Silicon Valley where he expressed misogynistic views on women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpSEnr"&gt;“We are deeply concerned about the recent hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” employees wrote in the petition. “His misogynistic statements in his autobiography — such as ‘&lt;em&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit’&lt;/em&gt; (further quoted below this letter) — directly oppose Apple’s commitment to Inclusion &amp;amp; Diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob9PmH"&gt;More than 2,000 employees signed the petition before it was published by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0Yuvq"&gt;Shortly after the petition began circulating internally at Apple, Martínez’s Slack account was deactivated. The ad platforms team was called into an emergency meeting where it was confirmed Martínez would no longer be working at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BROfl5"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple spokesperson said: “At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A security researcher found Wi-Fi vulnerabilities that have existed since the beginning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPtM0vZbDOp9YHsdxLKiSn9_uJI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278259/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v6vzxE"&gt;The security researcher who discovered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16484824/krack-wifi-encryption-bug-vulnerability-install-patch"&gt;the Krack Wi-Fi vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; has discovered &lt;a href="https://www.fragattacks.com"&gt;a slew of other flaws&lt;/a&gt; with the wireless protocol most of us use to power our online lives (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/update-windows-and-lots-of-other-stuff-asap-fragatta-1846878065"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerabilities relate to how Wi-Fi handles large chunks of data, with some being related to the Wi-Fi standard itself, and some being related to how it’s implemented by device manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niXbxn"&gt;The researcher, Mathy Vanhoef, calls the collection of vulnerabilities “FragAttacks,” with the name being a mashup of “fragmentation” and “aggregation.” He also says the vulnerabilities could be exploited by hackers, allowing them to intercept sensitive data, or show users fake websites, even if they’re using Wi-Fi networks secured with WPA2 or even WPA3. They could also theoretically exploit other devices on your home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHAxZE"&gt;There are twelve different attack vectors that fall under the classification, which all work in different ways. One exploits routers accepting plaintext during handshakes, one exploits routers caching data in certain types of networks, etc. If you want to read all the technical details on how exactly they work, you can check &lt;a href="https://www.fragattacks.com"&gt;out Vanhoef’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bhedN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/wifi-devices-going-back-to-1997-vulnerable-to-new-frag-attacks/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Vanhoef informed the WiFi Alliance about the vulnerabilities that were baked-in to the way Wi-Fi works so they could be corrected before he disclosed them to the public. Vanhoef says that he’s not aware of the vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. While he points out in a video that some of the vulnerabilities aren’t particularly easy to exploit, he says others would be “trivial” to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bya4EV"&gt;Vanhoef points out that some of the flaws can be exploited on networks using the WEP security protocol, indicating that they’ve been around since Wi-Fi was first implemented in 1997 (though if you’re still using WEP, these attacks should be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/8/5982701/cat-hacking-hack-wifi-war-kitteh"&gt;the least of your concerns&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e6khGt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88YZ4061tYw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVXfsh"&gt;Vanhoef says that the flaws are wide-spread, affecting many devices, meaning that there’s a lot of updating to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWh3TC"&gt;The thing about updating Wi-Fi infrastructure is that it’s always a pain. For example, before writing this article I went to check if my router had any updates, and realized that I had forgotten my login information (and I suspect I won’t be alone in that experience). There’s also devices that are just plain old, whose manufacturers are either gone or not releasing patches anymore. If you can, though, you should keep an eye on your router manufacturer’s website for any updates that are rolling out, especially if they’re &lt;a href="https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks/blob/master/ADVISORIES.md"&gt;in the advisory list&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxmjCe"&gt;Some vendors have already released patches for some of their products, including: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="N6Qt4h"&gt;As for anything else you need to do, &lt;a href="https://www.fragattacks.com/#notpatched"&gt;Vanhoef recommends&lt;/a&gt; the usual steps: keep your computers updated, use strong, unique passwords, don’t visit shady sites, and make sure you’re using HTTPS as often as possible. Other than that, it’s mostly being thankful that you’re not in charge of widespread IT infrastructure (my deepest condolences if you, in fact, are).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is using machine learning to make GTA V look incredibly, unsettlingly realistic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emTW_3Rw8JYa2vxj1HeRA_9OVak=/80x0:871x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278039/Screen_Shot_2021_05_12_at_1.20.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M1MlZc"&gt;One of the more impressive aspects of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V is&lt;/em&gt; how closely the game’s San Andreas approximates real-life Los Angeles and Southern California, but &lt;a href="https://intel-isl.github.io/PhotorealismEnhancement/"&gt;a new machine learning project&lt;/a&gt; from Intel Labs called “Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement” might take that realism in a unsettlingly photorealistic direction (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/grand-theft-auto-looks-frighteningly-photorealistic-wit-1846878938"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZUYTs"&gt;Putting the game through the processes researchers Stephan R. Richter, Hassan Abu Alhaija, and Vladlen Kolten created produces a surprising result: a visual look that has unmistakable similarities to the kinds of photos you might casually take through the smudged front window of your car. You have to see it in motion to really appreciate it, but the combination of slightly washed-out lighting, smoother pavement, and believably reflective cars just sells the fact you’re looking out at the real street from a real dashboard, even if it’s all virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vDjXxN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1IcaBn3ej0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jPRV7m"&gt;The Intel researchers suggest some of that photorealism comes from the datasets they fed their neural network. The group offers a more in-depth and thorough explanation for how image enhancement actually works &lt;a href="http://vladlen.info/papers/EPE.pdf"&gt;in their paper (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, but as I understand it, the &lt;a href="https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/"&gt;Cityscapes Dataset&lt;/a&gt; that was used — built largely from photographs of German streets — filled in a lot of the detail. It’s dimmer and from a different angle, but it almost captures what I imagine a smoother, more interactive version of scrolling through Google Maps’ Street View could be like. It doesn’t entirely behave like it’s real, but it looks very much like it’s built from real things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDONKS"&gt;The researchers say their enhancements go beyond what other photorealistic conversion processes are capable of by also integrating geometric information from &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; itself. Those “G-buffers,” as the researchers call them, can include data like the distance between objects in the game and the camera, and the quality of textures, like the glossiness of cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jas7OU"&gt;While you might not see an official “photorealism update” roll out to &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; tomorrow, you may have already played a game or watched a video that’s benefited from another kind of machine learning — AI upscaling. The process of using machine learning smarts to blow up graphics to higher resolutions doesn’t show up everywhere, but has been featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV&lt;/a&gt; and in several different mod projects focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18311287/ai-upscaling-algorithms-video-games-mods-modding-esrgan-gigapixel"&gt;upgrading the graphics of older games&lt;/a&gt;. In those cases a neural network is making predictions to fill in missing pixels of detail from a lower resolution game, movie, or TV show to reach those higher resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqBew2"&gt;Photorealism probably shouldn’t be the only graphical goal for video games to have (artistry aside, it looks kind of creepy), but this Intel Labs project does show there’s probably as much room to grow on the software side of things as there is in the raw GPU power of new consoles and gaming PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The child safety problem on platforms is worse than we knew</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iZOvMOi3lWzUvPfEA8dAqoxnBlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69278003/acastro_180329_1777__brains_science_0001_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B0obHy"&gt;Millions of young children are using platforms years before they turn 13 — and their presence could put many of them in danger. An &lt;a href="https://www.thorn.org/thorn-research-minors-perspectives-on-disclosing-reporting-and-blocking/"&gt;alarming new study&lt;/a&gt; has found that minors in the US often receive abuse, harassment, or sexual solicitation from adults on tech platforms. For the most part, though, children say they are not informing parents or other trusted adults about these interactions — and are instead turning for support for tech platforms, whose limited blocking and reporting tools have failed to address the threats they face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AzAr2"&gt;The report from &lt;a href="https://www.thorn.org/"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization that builds technology to defend children from sexual abuse, identifies a disturbing gap in efforts by Snap, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and others to keep children safe. Officially, children are not supposed to use most apps before they turn 13 without adult supervision. In practice, though, the majority of American children are using apps anyway. And even when they block and report bullies and predators, the majority of children say that they are quickly re-contacted by the same bad actors — either via new accounts or separate social platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FIGDVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to lean into what kids are doing, and beef up the support mechanisms so they’re not putting the onus on the child”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M7yHTA"&gt;Among the report’s key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ocl902"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children are using major platforms in large numbers long before they turn 13&lt;/strong&gt;: 45 percent of children ages 9-12 say they use Facebook daily; 40 percent use Instagram; 40 percent use Snapchat; 41 percent use TikTok; and 78 percent use YouTube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sPdbj9"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children report having online sexual interactions at high rates — both with their peers and people they believe to adults&lt;/strong&gt;: 25 percent of kids 9-17 reported having had a sexually explicit interaction with someone they thought was 18 or older, compared to 23 percent of participants that had a similar experience with someone they believed to be a minor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wCNZuY"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Children are more than twice as likely to use platform blocking and reporting tools than they are to tell parents and other caregivers about what happened&lt;/strong&gt;: 83 percent of 9- to 17-year-olds who reported having an online sexual interaction reacted with reporting, blocking, or muting the offender, while only 37 percent said they told a parent, trusted adult, or peer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8LG1jo"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The majority of children who block or report other users say those same users quickly find them again online&lt;/strong&gt;: More than half of children who blocked someone said they were contacted again by the same person again, either through a new account or a different platform. This was true both for people children knew in real life (54 percent) and people they had only met online (51 percent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="VEguY3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children who identify as LGBTQ+ experience all of these harms at higher rates than their non-LGBTQ+ peers&lt;/strong&gt;: 57 percent of youth who identify as LGBTQ+ said they have had potentially harmful experiences online, compared to 46 percent of non-LGBTQ+ youth. They also had online sexual interactions at much higher rates than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KDeKOf"&gt;
&lt;div id="UAaOio"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="Potentially harmful online experiences by platform" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-SCdPL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SCdPL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dBYQab"&gt;
&lt;p id="jV4LRx"&gt;Thorn’s research comes at a time when regulators are examining platforms’ child safety efforts with increasing scrutiny. In a March hearing, US lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/facebook-google-ceos-blasted-in-congress-over-apps-for-kids"&gt;criticized Facebook and Google for the potential effect their apps could have on children&lt;/a&gt;. And this week, 44 attorneys general wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/attorneys-general-ask-facebook-to-abandon-instagram-for-kids-plans.html"&gt;urging him to abandon a plan to create a version of Instagram for children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUBQW9"&gt;The Thorn report could trigger heightened scrutiny of the way young children use platforms, and the relatively few protections that tech companies have currently put in place to protect them or offer them support. It could also push the industry to collaborate on cross-platform solutions between Facebook, Google, Snap and others that Thorn says are needed to fully address the threats children face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1m3jr"&gt;Taken together, the findings suggest that platforms, parents, and governments need to work harder to understand how children are using technology from the time they are in elementary school, and develop new solutions to protect them as they explore online spaces and express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMEhr9"&gt;“Platforms have to be better at designing experiences,” said Julie Cordua, Thorn’s CEO, in an interview. “Adults need to create safe spaces for kids to have conversations … And then on the government and policy side, lawmakers need to understand kids’ online experiences at this level of detail. You’ve got to dive into the details and understand the experiences of youth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVgjBY"&gt;Data on these subjects is difficult to collect for several reasons, many of them obvious: the topics involved are extremely sensitive, and much of the best information is held within the private companies running the platform. To do its work, Thorn had 1,000 children ages 9 to 17 fill out a 20-minute online survey with their parents’ consent. The survey was conducted from October 25 to November 11, and the margin of sampling error is +/- 3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgFNig"&gt;The findings of the survey tell multiple stories about the current relationship between children and technology. The most pressing one may be that because young children are not supposed to use platforms, companies often do not build safety tools with them in mind. The result is a generation of children, some of them still in elementary school, attempting to navigate blocking and reporting tools that were designed for older teens and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS9opp"&gt; “Kids see platforms as a first line of engagement,” Cordua said. “We need to lean into what kids are doing, and beef up the support mechanisms so they’re not putting the onus on the child. Put the onus on the platform that’s building the experience and make it safe for all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9q2qMG"&gt;
&lt;div id="Ig2bfD"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="Platform usage habits: At least once a day" aria-label="table" id="datawrapper-chart-JHB6E" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JHB6E/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="681"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gunkZ7"&gt;
&lt;p id="D8ibqQ"&gt;An obvious thing platforms can do is to rewrite the language they employ for user reports to more accurately reflect the harms taking place there. Thorn found that 22 percent of minors who attempted to report that their nudes had been leaked didn’t feel like platform reporting systems permitted them to report it. In Silicon Valley terms, it’s a user experience problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7IBlz"&gt;“While minors say they are confident in their ability to use platform reporting tools to address their concerns, when given a series of commonly available options from reporting menus, many indicated that none of the options fit the situation,” the Thorn report says. “Nearly a quarter said they ‘don’t feel like any of these choices fit the situation’ of being solicited for (self-generated nudes) by someone they believe to be an adult (23 percent) or someone they believe to be under 18 (24 percent).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rNPwc8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;platform reporting tools can feel like fire alarms that have had their wires cut&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hp51A6"&gt;Thorn has other ideas for what platforms in particular should do here. For example, they could invest more heavily in age verification. Even if you accept that kids will always find ways into online spaces meant for adults, the sheer numbers can be surprising. Thorn found that 27 percent of 9- to 12-year-old boys have used a dating app; most dating apps require users to be at least 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnV9OV"&gt;Platforms could integrate crisis support phone numbers into messaging apps to help kids find resources when they have experienced abuse. They could share block lists with each other to help identify predators, though this would raise privacy and civil rights concerns. And they could invest more heavily in ban evasion so that predators and bullies can’t easily create alternate accounts after they are blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P93nD4"&gt;In their current state, Cordua told me, platform reporting tools can feel like fire alarms that have had their wires cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IayyC"&gt;“The good thing is, kids want to use these tools,” she said. “Now we need to make sure they work. This is an opportunity for us to ensure that if they pull that fire alarm, people respond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MZ6D4"&gt;Too often, though, no one does. One in three minors who have reported an issue said the platform took more than a week to respond, and 22 percent said they had made a report that was never resolved. “This is a critical window during which the child remains vulnerable to continued victimization,” the report authors say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2G5VB"&gt;The Thorn report found children on every platform where it looked. But some stood out for the frequency with which children reported experiencing harm. The platforms with the highest number of minors reported potential harm were Snapchat (26 percent), Instagram (26 percent), YouTube (19 percent), TikTok (18 percent), and Messenger (18 percent). The platforms where the most minors said they had an online sexual interaction were Snapchat (16 percent), Instagram (16 percent), Messenger (11 percent), and Facebook (10 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZipPU"&gt;I shared Thorn’s findings with these platforms and asked them to respond. Here’s what they told me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v81nrq"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snap&lt;/strong&gt;: “We really appreciate the extensive findings and related recommendations in Thorn’s research. The prevalence of unwanted sexual contact is horrific, and this study will help inform our ongoing efforts to combat these behaviors on Snapchat. In recent months, we have been increasing our in-app education and support tools for Snapchatters, working to revamp our in-app reporting tools, putting in place additional protections for minors, and expanding resources for parents. After reviewing this research, we are making additional changes to make us be even more responsive to the issues raised by the report.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EawlCS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Facebook and Instagram&lt;/strong&gt;: “We appreciate Thorn’s research and value our collaboration with them. We’ve made meaningful progress on these issues, including restricting Direct Messages between teens and adults they don’t follow on Instagram, helping teens avoid unwanted chats with adults, making it harder for adults to search for teens, improving reporting features, and updating our child safety policies to include more violating content for removal. However, Thorn’s research, while good, stopped far short of the global view on this issue when they excluded Apple’s iMessage, which is used heavily by teens, is preloaded on every iPhone, and is bigger than Messenger and Instagram Direct combined.” (Thorn responded to the swipe at Apple by saying it focused on social platforms because that is where many of these inappropriate relationships begin — typically they migrate to messaging apps from elsewhere.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jexte5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;: “YouTube doesn’t&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801999?hl=en"&gt; allow&lt;/a&gt; content that endangers the emotional and physical well-being of minors and we have strict&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268?hl=en"&gt; harassment policies&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting cyberbullying or content that threatens individuals in any way. Additionally, because YouTube has never been for people under 13, we created&lt;a href="https://youtube.com/kids/?gclid=COuXyszeh-MCFR6TxQIdcU4IGA"&gt; YouTube Kids&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and recently announced a&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supervised-experiences-for-families-on-youtube/"&gt; supervised account option&lt;/a&gt; for parents who have decided their tweens or teens are ready to explore YouTube.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pzS08C"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TikTok: &lt;/strong&gt;“Protecting minors is vitally important, and TikTok has taken industry-leading steps to promote a safe and age-appropriate experience for teens. These include setting accounts ages 13-15 to private by default, restricting direct messaging for younger teens, and committing to publish information regarding removals of suspected underage accounts in our Transparency Reports.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="S3NmI3"&gt;While platforms have implemented a variety of partial solutions to the issue of underage access and the harms that can follow, there remains a lack of industry-wide standards or collaboration on solutions. Meanwhile, parents and lawmakers seem largely ignorant of the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otiRpv"&gt;For too long, tech companies have been able to set aside problems related to the presence of children on their platforms simply by saying that kids are not allowed there, and that the companies work hard to remove them. The Thorn report illustrates the degree to which harms remain on the platform in spite of, and even partially because of, this stance. To truly protect children, they will need to take decisive and more coordinated action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1glNBB"&gt;“Let’s deal with the reality that kids are in these spaces, and re-create it as a safe space,” Cordua said. “When you build for the weakest link, or you build for the most vulnerable, you improve what you’re building for every single person.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden signs executive order aiming to prevent future cybersecurity disasters</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XJfGZM"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday implementing new policies aimed to improve national cybersecurity. The executive order comes in the wake of a number of recent cybersecurity catastrophes, such as last week’s ransomware attack that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;took down the Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, the Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities that may have affected north of 60,000 organizations, and the SolarWinds hack that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;compromised nine federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; late last year — each of which were specifically namedropped by the White House in a fact sheet accompanying the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDglsS"&gt;The executive order outlines a number of initiatives, including reducing barriers to information sharing between the government and the private sector, mandating the deployment of multi-factor authentication in the federal government, establishing a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board, and creating a standardized playbook for responding to “cyber incidents.” You can read more about all of the initiatives &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/"&gt;in the White House’s fact sheet here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MvPrJ"&gt;In the past few months, we’ve seen example after example of major IT systems breaking down, whether they allowed for a huge effort like the email server hack from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;state-sponsored Chinese hacking group Hafnium&lt;/a&gt; (the White House promised a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;whole of government response&lt;/a&gt;” to that one), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719056/baltimore-county-public-schools-cancel-class-bcps-ransomware-hack"&gt;a ransomware attack that forced public schools to cancel classes&lt;/a&gt;, or even a pair of breakdowns that appear to have allowed workers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368476/kansas-man-tamper-water-supply-remote-ellsworth-wyatt-travnichek"&gt;remote into their local water supply&lt;/a&gt; and mess things up. The policies outlined in Wednesday’s executive order could create critical infrastructure to help prevent future cybersecurity disasters — or, at the very least, better limit any potential fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Target will stop selling Pokémon cards in stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Target Store Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dE8d_UQKJ2qTeB_-j81lZG4-6ao=/0x0:3966x2644/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69277978/1231463209.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CihKXR"&gt;Target has decided that it’s had enough: the company &lt;a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/target-stores-to-halt-sales-of-all-trading-cards-from-may-14th-forward/"&gt;has officially confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bleeding Cool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it will halt the sales of Pokémon cards throughout the US, starting Friday, May 14th. The retailer cities “an abundance of caution” for the safety of both guests and store employees and notes that it will still be selling the cards on its site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnevIz"&gt;Currently, Pokémon cards (and other trading cards) are having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22413108/pokemon-trading-card-collectors-overwhelm-grading-collecting-rating"&gt;a moment&lt;/a&gt;: people have swamped card grading companies, hoping to get a rating that makes their cards more valuable, and The Pokémon Company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276738/pokemon-trading-card-game-printing-short-supply-high-demand"&gt;has been rushing&lt;/a&gt; to print enough cards to meet the demand. It seems that all the big numbers around the truly rare original cards have caused a lot of excitement around new cards as well. But Target isn’t feeling the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHMz8C"&gt;It’s hard to blame the retailer, as the situation around the trading cards seems wildly out of control. People have &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22417628/pokemon-cards-cereal-general-mills-lucky-charms-cinnamon-toast-crunch-walmart-resell-scalpers"&gt;reportedly been opening cereal boxes in stores&lt;/a&gt; to steal the included Pokémon cards out of them. And someone in Japan even &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/man-arrested-after-failed-pokemon-card-heist-no-team-rocket-members-involved/"&gt;climbed down a rope&lt;/a&gt; to steal almost $9,000 worth of the cardboard cards designed for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EoUuD6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The situation around the trading cards seems wildly out of control&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aY07s0"&gt;Target has recently started limiting how many packs customers are allowed to purchase, and has &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv9dd/target-is-prepared-to-call-the-cops-on-frantic-pokemon-card-hunters"&gt;even threatened to get law enforcement involved&lt;/a&gt; if it found people camping out by its stores for them. There was also an incident at one of the stores where &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/fight-over-trading-cards-outside-brookfield-target"&gt;someone pulled a gun during a fight&lt;/a&gt; about sports cards — which could explain why the halt also applies to MLB, NFL, and NBA cards as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxBzrY"&gt;Before Target’s official statement, some people had seen signs announcing the new policy in the aisles of their local stores, signs which have &lt;a href="https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/target-is-no-longer-selling-pokemon-cards-amid-scalper-crisis-1572507/"&gt;apparently been showing up all over the US&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dMKSV9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, I guess Pokémon, MLB, NFL, and NBA trading cards are no longer going to be sold at Target stores starting this Friday. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pUzbQ9Esey"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pUzbQ9Esey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alan Johnson (@TheAlanJohnson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheAlanJohnson/status/1392549620975169537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
