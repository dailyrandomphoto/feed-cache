    <title>Windows 11 is full of delightful detail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdhOQzt4TyF-I_LZIWvUiJwOmys=/0x100:600x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576125/windows11animations.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SaVnKH"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;Windows 11 preview&lt;/a&gt; has been available for a couple of weeks now, but I’m still discovering new animations and details in this new OS that put a smile on my face. While the new Start menu and centered taskbar are the obvious changes in Windows 11 that you’ll notice straight away, it’s the small animations throughout the OS that really make it feel a lot more fresh and alive than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrYuFo"&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/windows-11-designing-the-next-generation-of-windows-490c02fb6373"&gt;started detailing&lt;/a&gt; some of the design approaches it has used for Windows 11 and its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRHkSraHhTA/"&gt;attention to detail for daily micro-interactions&lt;/a&gt;. That includes things like a checkbox that has an animated tick to subtly let you know when you interact with it, or a settings cog that spins when you hover over it. Plenty of buttons in Windows 11 pop with faint signs of life or bounce as you move around the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s82-gwVEIYem2h081qCsKU98LuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714875/windows11button.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Windows 11 button pops into life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52fLGKG9SrDzD87iCsgj5xww4bE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714879/windows11pop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These tiny animations can be found throughout Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5VXVr"&gt;It’s this attention to detail that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;makes Windows 11 feel fresh and new&lt;/a&gt; but still familiar to use on a daily basis. The animations are often playful but in equal parts useful to provide an important visual cue for what you’re interacting with. Thankfully, they’re not in your face, slow, or annoying, mostly because Microsoft designed them to be calming. “Calmness is much needed in today’s world... Windows 11 facilitates this through foundational experiences that feel familiar, soften formerly intimidating UI, and increase emotional connection,” &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/windows-11-designing-the-next-generation-of-windows-490c02fb6373"&gt;says Microsoft’s design team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7YRvyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 is a new and refreshing approach to an old and familiar home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"},{"title":"Microsoft releases Windows 11 preview, available to download now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5gVYmW"&gt;While the subtle animations might be calming, the choice to center the taskbar and change the Start menu is the more striking change in Windows 11. “After listening to people express a need for more efficiency and less noise when using Start, we designed a cleaner and simpler experience that puts people at the center by prioritizing the apps they love and the documents they need,” says Microsoft’s design team. “It also adapts to modern device form factors and enables easier access for all screen sizes, from a Surface Go to an ultrawide monitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQwMy_37u1vf8OR4648a6ThS55A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714884/windows11startmenucompare.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu versus Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2xCqEK"&gt;Windows 11 also improves the out-of-box experience (OOBE) of when you set up a machine for the first time. The settings you configure are a lot more useful than in Windows 10, including naming your PC and setting up a PC for how you intend to use it. Sometimes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22338205"&gt;it’s the little things that count&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HO5LTJ"&gt;Microsoft has also added rounded corners to most parts of Windows 11, new iconography, and an updated Segoe UI Variable font. Like most of Windows 11, these are subtle changes that you only really start to notice after using the OS for a few days. Microsoft even worked with design studio &lt;a href="https://sixnfive.com/"&gt;Six N Five&lt;/a&gt; to create most of the wallpapers you’ll see in Windows 11. They’re mostly centered to match the Start menu. “We want your journey into Windows 11 to be literally centered from the start,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOjaCl"&gt;The Windows 11 design certainly isn’t perfect, though. It’s a work in progress, but there’s still a lot of inconsistency in this preview that needs to be ironed out. At times, it still feels like Microsoft is mashing together Windows from a decade ago with this modern and simple UI. There’s a lot that goes into overhauling something as big and sprawling as Windows, so hopefully the final product smooths up some of the early and rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why small design decisions can matter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17G7ICTe46Jq7FmIdSSxdFV23Io=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576081/vpavic_4547_20210421_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tci1Is"&gt;While we usually look for major features in a device — speed or sound quality or picture sharpness — sometimes it’s the little things that can make or break your experience with that device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOmJGb"&gt;I realized this recently when I bought myself a pair of Jabra Elite 75t earbuds for day-to-day use. I really liked my new earbuds. But while my previous headset came with a detachable loop that you could use to attach it to a bag or a keyring or whatever, the Jabra case has no way of attaching to anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkyroV"&gt;Now, I wasn’t about to return the earbuds because of this, but it did cause me to growl a little. In order to get that same convenient functionality I had enjoyed with my previous earbuds, I had to buy a cheap silicone cover for the case — one that came with a carabiner that I could hook onto my bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2klN3s"&gt;It also started me thinking about other easily overlooked design features that we may not even think about when we buy a device but become issues once we start using the device on a day-to-day basis. For example, about five seconds after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; hit the market, it was followed by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;veritable onslaught of accessories&lt;/a&gt; (a number of them made by Apple itself) with one purpose and one purpose only: to fix the fact that the AirTag doesn’t come with a hole so that you can attach it to anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A rugged AirTag case from Spigen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rugged AirTag case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2njEARZjRJCslErK-S4v0w2nUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714856/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_11.21.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Aotao&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case with carabiner for the Jabra Elite 75t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx8ONJ"&gt;Of course, you can look at the positive viewpoint: that, as with my Jabra Elite 75t, the lack of a convenient attachment provides a lot of companies with an additional source of income. And after all, what’s another few dollars added to the cost of something as nifty as the AirTag? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpNgAD"&gt;That is until you consider there are design decisions out there that are just as unnecessary but convenient and are included with the device. In fact, some of these are features you may not even know were needed until you realize how useful they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wOKbf"&gt;Here’s an example: I’m one of those people who tends to have a tangle of plugged-in white and black cables in several corners of my home — tangles that I have to search every time I want to, say, use a USB-C cable for my phone or the power cable for my MacBook. Most of the time, I have to pick up one of the cables and follow it to the end to make sure it’s the one I need. However, I can find the cable for my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; laptop in a couple of seconds because the end of the cable has a small LED that is always lit when the other end is plugged into power, making it really easy to find. Dell didn’t have to put that LED in there — but I’m incredibly glad it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA9jmE"&gt;There are loads of other small design pluses that are out there making life just a little bit easier for many of us, like ridges on the bottom of laptops to make it a little easier to carry the thing without dropping it (and simultaneously making it more comfortable to type on) or low-tech shutters that can block off the camera on the Echo Show 8 to provide that extra bit of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbBgSV"&gt;Perhaps the conclusion to be drawn from this is even the smaller design decisions that are made when creating a new tech device can affect our feeling about that product — maybe even enough so that we as consumers might take those decisions into consideration when the next model comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgx5p6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx2Z27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram tests a ‘reshare’ sticker, which actually makes it harder to share posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jz_o5RkCCtK1IYXNf3ACVetbEqE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576046/reshare.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9eRaUr"&gt;Instagram doesn’t want you to spam your friends with all of the posts you come across and like. So today, it’s starting a test to make sharing to Stories slightly trickier. The company is testing a “reshare” sticker that can be placed in Stories. When selected, a “recently viewed” tab will surface and let users choose from posts they’ve seen in the last hour, saved, or posted, which they can then share in their story. They can insert IGTV, reels, and feed video content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW17xu"&gt;You can get an idea of what the test looks like in the image above. Previously, if you wanted to share a feed post to your story, you had to so manually from the post itself. This test will replace that functionality, effectively requiring you to navigate away from the post itself and into the create mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9cIur"&gt;An Instagram spokesperson says the test is designed to make people more “intentional” and “deliberate” about what they post. Presumably, this means they don’t want people to just tap a share button from a post and instead are introducing slightly more friction to do so. At the same time, Instagram likely wants people to engage more with content on the app, and this might raise the bar of what people see and, therefore, get them to tap through on various photos and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zp4Yj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s weather app won’t ever say it’s 69 degrees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8ZFtqx_zBsNmgKO6joOOfjyJKA=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575922/weatherapps_watermarked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A weather forecast on iOS 15 compared to the rounded forecast on iOS 14.6 | Photo: Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M4uruv"&gt;If you’re an iPhone user, the weather is always a particularly nice 70 degrees. Or 68 degrees. Any temperature but 69 degrees, actually, because it turns out that the built-in weather app on some versions of iOS — including the current version, iOS 14.6 — will refuse to display &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/06/why-69-is-the-internets-coolest-number-sex.html"&gt;the internet’s favorite number&lt;/a&gt;, even if the actual temperature in a given location is, in fact, 69 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMr6lM"&gt;It’s not clear if this is a bug or an intentional attempt from Apple to cut down on 69-related humor. The rounding is only visible in the weather app itself: clicking through to Apple’s source data from &lt;a href="http://Weather.com"&gt;Weather.com&lt;/a&gt; will show the proper temperature, as does Apple’s home screen widgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CU5IC3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10650148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPPrmh"&gt;That said, the iOS weather app will refuse to show 69 degrees anywhere in the forecast, whether for the current temperature, the hourly forecast for the day, or the extended forecast. The rounding is specific to the numeral 69, too: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed that other numbers with a 9 in the ones place, like 59 degrees or 79 degrees, display accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kshBrZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vei02X"&gt;It’s not clear when Apple introduced the rounding here. A phone running iOS 11.2.1 shows accurate data of 69 degrees, as did phones running iOS 15, so it’s possible that the issue is specific to Apple’s most recent update (or has been identified and fixed already). Other weather sources, including Dark Sky — which is owned by Apple — have no issue displaying 69 degrees, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heuj6P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Apple for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Barracuda X wireless headset plays nicely with PS5, Switch, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Barracuda X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zuJzYOyFZTw0ebqvnKp2dp7Jdi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575639/cfaulkner_210705_4660_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Barracuda X borrows the sleek design of Razer’s Opus headphones.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9cBpNd"&gt;Razer has introduced the Barracuda X, a multiplatform wireless gaming headset that takes design cues from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;the company’s Opus noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. They’re launching today for $99.99, which is more aggressive than I expected, given that the company usually comes in at a premium price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKOmKi"&gt;The Barracuda X is a big step for Razer in that it’s finally jumping into USB-C connectivity — both in terms of how the headset charges and how it transmits audio wirelessly. Included in the box is a small USB-C wireless transmitter that’s almost identical to the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries has included with some of its headsets since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It allows compatibility with the Nintendo Switch in portable mode, the PS5’s front-facing USB-C port, and some phones and tablets directly through their USB-C ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LGT7f"&gt;Razer includes a five-foot USB-A cable with a USB-C female end that the transmitter can plug into for devices that don’t have a USB-C port, like a PC, PS4, or the Switch’s dock. It can also serve as an extender if there’s some interference between the headset and your USB-C port. None of this is cutting-edge in the headset world at this point, but it’s a broad amount of compatibility for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60JUcI"&gt;The headset also works wired, and includes a 3.5mm cable. The headset isn’t compatible with Xbox consoles due to the fact that they operate on Microsoft’s own wireless protocol, which is unsupported. This is disappointing, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21502286/steelseries-arctis-7p-7x-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-usbc-wireless-gaming-headset"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 7X&lt;/a&gt; includes a similar dongle with a toggle switch to work on Xbox and other platforms. Razer will likely get there at some point, but not today. You can plug the Barracuda X audio cable into your Xbox controller’s 3.5mm jack. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Barracuda X" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4O3ZZEbAnRSgwg5X-dqKXmv0-fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703920/cfaulkner_210706_4660_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C transmitter is relatively low-profile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1CmULe"&gt;This product is the first in the line of Barracuda headsets, and it’s setting a strong precedent  for future iterations. The style of the Barracuda X is a far cry from the likes of the Kraken and the BlackShark V2, looking more like headphones than a gaming headset. Razer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was aiming for a design that appears platform-agnostic, so as to indicate to people that this is a headset that’s likely made for your preferred platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8A2bm"&gt;The Barracuda X weighs 250 grams, and Razer says this is its lightest wireless headset yet. After wearing it for about a week, I can vouch that it’s comfortable to wear after several hours of use. The ear pads are soft and breathable, yet dense enough to create some passable noise isolation. The cups themselves can swivel 90 degrees, which is handy for slimming their profile for storage in a bag. But that swivel feature works backwards when you’re wearing them. For some reason, Razer engineered them to swivel in the opposite direction than I prefer, resting the hard side of the cups against your chest instead of the soft ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mic and all the controls are placed along the edge of the left ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4WUFiL"&gt;In terms of performance, these sound great for a $100 headset. These employ the same “TriForce” driver design &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;originally found in the BlackShark V2 headset&lt;/a&gt;, with three distinct sections for delivering bass, mids, and treble. Though, the drivers are a bit smaller in the Barracuda X: 40mm compared to 50mm in the BlackShark V2 series. I still need to test them a bit more to give a verdict, but &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 rivaled Sony’s Pulse 3D Audio headset — both in terms of sound quality and positional audio capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsjXgK"&gt;Other hardware features to note include a detachable boom microphone (which doesn’t support mic monitoring, unfortunately), and its on-headset controls are all located along the edge of the left ear cup. There’s a mute button, a volume wheel, and a power button, which can serve as a multifunction button when connected to some devices. Tapping it once while connected to my Android phone paused music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOUxYY"&gt;One thing to note is that it’s possible Razer may release a more fully-featured version of the Barracuda. Historically, products with an “X” in the name tend to be the low to mid-end offering, and usually a “Pro” model follows after a few months. It’s tough to say what a Barracuda Pro (if that’s what it’d be named) would offer over this version announced today, but features like Bluetooth, an extra dial for game and chat audio mixing, mic monitoring support, or Xbox wireless compatibility are just a few that are on the table. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Machine learning model from the largest US COVID-19 dataset predicts disease severity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwWxaKeng6za8B_d0QYnCWxcwkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575644/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1eMdQ9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522863/health-data-records-covid-coronavirus-model-nih-privacy-n3c"&gt;centralized repository of COVID-19 health records&lt;/a&gt; built last year is beginning to show results, starting with a &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.16901?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=071321"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published today. The repository is the largest set of COVID-19 records to date, and was built by a team of researchers and data experts last year to help make sense of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RCAq3"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, looked at risk factors for severe cases of COVID-19 and traced the progression of the disease over time. The authors&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;built machine learning models to predict which hospitalized patients would develop severe disease based on information collected on their first day in a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCS2UP"&gt;Using the centralized database, called the National COVID Cohort Collaborative Data Enclave, or &lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c"&gt;N3C&lt;/a&gt;, meant the research team was able to include hundreds of thousands of patients’ records in its analysis. The study used data from 34 medical centers and included over 1 million adults — 174,568 who tested positive for COVID-19 and 1,133,848 who tested negative. It includes records stretching from January 2020 to December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00yL1U"&gt;The analysis shows how treatment for COVID-19 changed over the course of 2020, as doctors tried new treatments and gained more experience with the condition. The percentage of patients who were treated with the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which was promoted by former President Donald Trump before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291694/fda-hydroxychloroquine-emergency-authorization-trump-barda"&gt;proving to be ineffective&lt;/a&gt;, dropped off to nearly zero by May 2020. Use of the steroid dexamethasone ticked up in June, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292765/steroid-coronavirus-survival-data-results-dexamethasone-oxford"&gt;studies showed&lt;/a&gt; it could improve survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JNxWq"&gt;It also confirmed that survival rates for patients with COVID-19 improved over the course of 2020. In March and April, 16 percent of people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 died. In September and October, that dropped to just under 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsKwQH"&gt;People who had higher heart rates, breathing rates, and temperatures when they arrived at the hospital were more likely to need drastic interventions like ventilation. They were also more likely to die. Abnormal white blood cell count, inflammation, blood acidity, and kidney function were also linked to more severe cases. The research team built machine learning models using those and other data points that could predict which patients would get seriously ill. The models could eventually be used as the basis for decision-making tools with additional testing, the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNzShh"&gt;Researchers have been analyzing the trajectory of COVID-19 since the very start of the pandemic. This study has the advantage of pulling from a large and diverse dataset — it’s not restricted to one hospital or one state. In the US, researchers are often limited to studying the medical records from patients at the institutions where they work. That means the number of records they’re able to include in studies can be limited, and they’re not able to easily check if their conclusions would apply in other places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m1Xss"&gt;A resource like N3C, which pulls together records from dozens of institutions, sidesteps those limitations. By now, N3C includes data from &lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/news/releases/2020/access-to-N3C-COVID-19-data-analytics-platform-now-open"&gt;73 health institutions&lt;/a&gt; and has records from over 2 million COVID-19 patients. More than &lt;a href="https://covid.cd2h.org/projects"&gt;200 research projects&lt;/a&gt; using the data are underway, including studies examining risk factors for COVID-19 re-infection and the disease’s impact on pregnancy. It’s not perfect — standardizing information across hospitals is hard, and there may not be complete data on many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C90pPt"&gt;Still, having such a large set of data is invaluable. Researchers are using the resource to run studies that they may not have been able to tackle with just their own institution’s resources, Elaine Hill, a health economist at the University of Rochester working on pregnancy research, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522863/health-data-records-covid-coronavirus-model-nih-privacy-n3c"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last fall&lt;/a&gt;. “It makes it possible to shed light on things we wouldn’t be able to,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s PS5 exclusive Ghostwire: Tokyo is delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tango Gameworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZTVRLW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo, &lt;/em&gt;the paranormal action game from Japanese studio Tango Gameworks, is being delayed to early 2022. Tango Gameworks posted the news &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playGhostwire/status/1414947726731751443"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, saying it will show more of the game in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owtb0V"&gt;“We want to get the game in your hands as soon as possible so you can experience the unforgettable version of a haunted Tokyo that we’ve been hard at work building. At the same time, we’re also focused on protecting the health of everyone at Tango,” the announcement reads. “Our new release window will give us time to bring the world of &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; to life as we’ve always envisioned it.” The game was previously slated for release in fall of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SQCsiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660695/e3-2019-trailers-nintendo-microsoft-square-enix-ubisoft-ea"&gt;was announced&lt;/a&gt; at E3 2019, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21277231/ps5-playstation-5-game-trailers-launch-release-dates-sony-event"&gt;first gameplay&lt;/a&gt; was revealed in June 2020, when Sony touted the game as a timed PlayStation 5 (and PC) exclusive. A few months later, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x"&gt;acquired Tango’s parent company ZeniMax&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; one of two Microsoft-owned but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;initially PlayStation-exclusive games&lt;/a&gt;. The other exclusive, Arkane’s &lt;em&gt;Deathloop, &lt;/em&gt;was also delayed but is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442372/deathloop-preview-arkane-studios-ps5"&gt;scheduled for a September release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSuO0K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostwire&lt;/em&gt; puts players in a Tokyo that’s been nearly deserted by humans and invaded by ghosts. Its executive producer is Tango founder Shinji Mikami of &lt;em&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; fame, although it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ghostwire-tokyo-everything-we-know/"&gt;supposedly less focused&lt;/a&gt; on survival horror than those games. Original &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/9/18659141/ikumi-nakamura-bethesda-e3-2019-ghostwire-tokyo-presenter"&gt;creative director Ikumi Nakamura&lt;/a&gt; stepped away from Tango soon after the initial announcement, later &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ikumi-nakamura-talks-about-her-new-studio-while-explori-1846546822"&gt;saying she’d left&lt;/a&gt; because of health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to teach TikTok what you like to watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PuDcr1tLAEeWDpdHlzoZ2CMRqg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575537/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="grDwtA"&gt;TikTok is a brand-new type of social media platform. Unlike more traditional platforms like Instagram or Twitter where you manually curate your feeds by choosing to follow others — most likely, people you know — TikTok uses an algorithm to curate a highly personalized feed of videos. This algorithm can get shockingly specific as it gathers the videos it thinks you’ll like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqxEOh"&gt;TikTok’s main page is named the For You page — and that really means &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, after I’d been on TikTok for a while, the algorithm figured out that I’m a grown-up emo kid (it was never a phase, Mom) who is trying to learn French, spends too much time playing &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sims 4&lt;/em&gt;, and is also queer. But TikTok’s algorithm didn’t get that shockingly specific by itself. It took time and effort for me to tailor the videos so perfectly to my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuFzb9"&gt;While TikTok does eventually learn the type of videos you like, when an account is brand-new, it can be challenging to find content that appeals to you. At the start, the For You page will typically show mega-viral videos from the app’s most popular users, but if you want to see what other videos and creators are out there, there are a few steps you can follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roarz4"&gt;Use the discover tab to find trending sounds, hashtags, and effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="22GuVn"&gt;When starting out on TikTok, the easiest way to find videos is by looking at what’s trending. At the bottom of the screen next to the upload button is the Discover icon. Tap on it to find a collection of popular hashtags, sounds, and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nchuOo"&gt;By clicking through these videos, finding entertaining content is quick and enjoyable. By saving the sounds or interacting with the videos through likes, sharing, or commenting, the algorithm starts to get an idea of what you like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TikTok’s Discovery page lets you search on hashtags." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CiH0jMLsOjvByrlDdoJNFVLjza4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713500/IMG_8007.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok’s Discovery page lets you search on hashtags.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also find all the videos that use the same sound." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4YVqF9Ii0erD3Rr3fpxdTV3Se2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713512/IMG_8011.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also find all of the videos that use the same sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Bqvmei"&gt;Search for things you like &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rUFnjI"&gt;While you’re in the Discover tab, use the search bar up top to look for topics you enjoy. When I first typed “Science” into the search bar, Tiktok showed me all the top videos for that topic. If I wanted to explore even more, I could have clicked through the options for users, hashtags, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoZFXe"&gt;As opposed to looking at trending sounds and topics, this method is an easy way to find a variety of videos with different hashtags and music. Liking the videos (by clicking the heart-shaped “like” button on the side) and following the creators (by clicking the creator’s icon on the side of the screen and then on the red “Follow” button) will help ensure that the type of content you enjoy comes up on your For You page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the Search bar in the Discovery page to find content you like." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b4FYupn50QQdvmwZgKj1TjcIxrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713504/IMG_8008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the Search bar in the Discovery page to find content you like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can filter your search using the tabs on top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxg-s0tpe2e33A8SLZ7PAnxnOzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714626/IMG_8064.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can filter your search using the tabs on top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JCYuX2"&gt;Click on sounds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zzVzGY"&gt;The more the algorithm learns about you, the more you’ll start to notice trends within whatever TikTok rabbit hole you’ve gone down. A lot of the time, these trends are built around sounds. The sounds can be audio clips from popular media, music, or even audio created by another user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wexCYu"&gt;In the bottom-right corner of a video, you’ll see a rotating circle, and this is where the sound lives. By pressing that, it’s easy to find a trove of other videos that use that sound (if the sound is trending or at least relatively popular). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgYYxs"&gt;Although you’ll only be watching videos that use the same sound, this is a great way to find a large variety of creators that might not have made it to your For You Page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXfg4C"&gt;TikTok can be a great tool to pass the time, socialize, or learn new things. At the start, though, it can take a little time to build up the patterns before the algorithm begins to do the work for you. Just be careful — it’s very easy to accidentally lose three hours of your day watching TikToks without realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Loki built a different reality with retro hardware</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-dF0xE28pPTFHJLIT7ysnJdtJY=/0x0:2412x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69575328/moc1040_102_comp_v012_03038a04.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Production designer Kasra Farahani explains the show’s distinct look&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3WH9Ww"&gt;For me, watching &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; has meant pausing each episode to admire the devices that keep the Time Variance Authority running — all curved silhouettes and comically tiny screens and hazy orange readouts. By the time I asked &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; production designer Kasra Farahani about the show’s prop design inspirations, I’d convinced myself that the TemPad had to be based on a Nintendo DS. It’s all I can think of whenever Mobius (Owen Wilson) flips open the little oblong compact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4i980"&gt;“Actually, the primary piece of research that we were looking at is, there’s this crazy image that I found of a calculator watch on a wrist,” says Farahani, when I ask him about the TemPad’s aesthetic origins. “But the calculator watch is huge, it’s like the size of an iPhone, almost... it’s basically a scientific calculator strapped to [someone’s] wrist.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zqx5OS"&gt;Like its &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1107129/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; sibling &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; takes a slight detour into the outer wilds of Marvel comicdom that don’t just involve beating the crap out of overbearing villains. While the series is very much a Marvel product, from the MCU in-jokes to the one-line zingers, its production design tells a more nuanced story about the multidimensional world that TVA agents Mobius and Ravonna Renslayer live in — a world built on old technology that conjures a romantic past when machines were still curious and funny and even a little bit magical.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wvdci"&gt;“Basically all the computers were custom builds, with a combination of retro televisions and retro computers combined with disparate, other random pieces of tech, all kind of kludged together,” explains Farahani, who plans to post more detailed, up-close photos of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; toys after the last episode airs on July 14th. According to the series’ style guide, the all-powerful TVA has been able to pick and choose different technologies from different timelines as they please. “The conceit behind the technology at the TVA as we imagined it was that... digital technology never existed, and that analog technology just continued to get more and more sophisticated,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="ckuICo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiFYXj"&gt;And yet, with the power to use any kind of technology they want, the TVA still gravitates toward &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube"&gt;cathode ray tube&lt;/a&gt;-style screens, which continue to be major sentimental and historical touchpoints in conversations about &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crt-tube-tv-hot-gaming-tech-retro-games/"&gt;nostalgia&lt;/a&gt; and tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16973914/tvs-crt-restoration-led-gaming-vintage"&gt;preservation&lt;/a&gt;, especially in games. &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s Richard Leadbetter &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-modern-games-look-beautiful-on-crt-monitors"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the beauty and significance of playing modern games on CRT screens, not just because of their low latency and reduced input lag. It seems that even in Earth-199999 — the version of Earth in the MCU — these same feelings prevail, even if the hardware is in service of a monolithic bureaucracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBDuTh"&gt;According to Farahani, the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; design team was big on primitive CRT playback aesthetics, which were mostly green (“there are amber-colored versions of it,” he adds). In the first episode, the TVA paperwork clerk can be seen playing solitaire on his tiny orange-hued monitor, and you get the feeling he isn’t the only desk jockey running games on their work computer. One might wonder what kind of games can be played on the TemPad by bored TVA agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YauTbW"&gt;“We made a decision that there should never be color on the screens, really, that they should be monochromatic... and it’s like an 8-bit look, almost like a first-generation Game Boy,” says Farahani. “So even when you look at ‘video footage’ on the TemPad, it’s been digitized into that monochrome 8-bit look.” (&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; director Kate Herron &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22525909/loki-director-kate-herron-interview"&gt;previously told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the TemPad’s display “was definitely inspired by SNES games and also the old Game Boy Camera.”) Even from a cursory glance at the TVA devices in the first few episodes, it’s easy to get &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; Pip-Boy vibes from some of the old-timey computer interfaces; the TVA’s trademark orange tint is also a neat callback to analog &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SELF-SCAN#"&gt;Burroughs SELF-SCAN displays of the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, which ushered in a memorable era of CRT monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BHGHo"&gt;In creating this vast, faceless bureaucratic machine, the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; design team needed to source enough old hardware to furnish whole offices. “A lot of it was our set decorator Claudia Bonfe and her team [who] found an amazing array of retro televisions,” says Farahani. “Some of these things, they’re old and they’re brittle, so by the time you get them, the amount of modifications that we wanted to do to them, they just wouldn’t hold up. So it was easier in many cases to just fabricate them or build them from scratch.” (There is, however, a prominent &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-are-the-cool-computer-terminals-in-marvels-loki"&gt;Lear Siegler ADM-3A&lt;/a&gt; sitting on the reception desk when we first see the TVA, which could be the real deal.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hI2zoDhXOTMocUU8RBIsY_CDqKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713476/tac1120_104_comp_v006_aa38eee4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mhzdJE"&gt;The team built custom props like the Chronomonitor — the 7-foot-wide screen in the Time Theater — which weighed hundreds of pounds and was constructed from scratch. (Sadly, it’s not functional; playback was done in post). The eye-catching red bubble monitor is another bespoke creation. It’s essentially a remote control for the Holoprojector, which runs off 70mm analog film reels. To preserve the idea that the TVA is an old-school WiFi-free zone, the two are connected with a huge cable that runs across the set. The team also built the hanging monitors that play the Miss Minutes animation and the yellow TVA computers in quantum monitoring, inspired by retro technological form language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fBPb6"&gt;Naturally, the old-school elements also extended to the in-show visuals, from the Miss Minutes cartoon to the Time Theater’s holographic projections. “We tried very hard to keep… almost a photographic quality in terms of aberrations and fuzzy edges and film grain… and having the glitches be analog glitches, not digital types of glitches, which is a very different look,” Farahani says. “These are small details, but they’re super important for us both in the design of the hardware… because all of it in the end contributes to the worldbuilding of the TVA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jaSKBG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Analog technology just continued to get more and more sophisticated”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ioedd"&gt;But what was the kind of world that produced this now-obsolete tech to begin with? Farahani says that, from an industrial design standpoint, the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; crew drew their inspiration from the imaginative, weird window of time that encompasses the post-WWII and Cold War era. “In our fiction, [the TVA is] a bureaucratic organization that was probably super well-funded or incepted, or had been renovated in the post-war era,” he explains. “Imagine that a bureaucracy, or an organization that gets this massive infusion of resources at a certain point, and then doesn’t again for decades, and then they’re just using that same tech, and it’s slowly degrading.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M64aM3"&gt;The idea that a near-omniscient galactic surveillance agency is shuffling along on outdated technology probably hits a little too close to home for people who have struggled with simple government administration processes in the present day. But it’s a tried-and-tested approach to visual storytelling that takes a page from Terry Gilliam’s &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt; (and even, to an extent, his later film &lt;em&gt;Twelve Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;). Even as all this old machinery highlights the inefficacies and archaic qualities of a bloated bureaucracy, there’s still something so intrinsically romantic about watching a TVA clerk — our solitaire-playing, cat-owning buddy who does the processing paperwork — print out reams of dot matrix printer paper with the iconic perforated sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZuaAo"&gt;A somewhat bittersweet effect of watching &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; has been thinking about the technologies — particularly gaming hardware — that we’ve lost to time. Seeing the 8-bit TemPad even brought to mind my old 4-bit Game &amp;amp; Watch collection — small tablet-like LCD-screen handhelds popular in the 1980s, that came in a dualscreen clamshell version for specific games (namely &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt;). A small part of me hopes that &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; has, perhaps unintentionally, prompted viewers to consider the importance of archiving and preserving old things, which is somewhat ironic given the TVA’s tendency to prune everything that doesn’t quite fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uoiqMb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; isn’t so much a story about a fantastical possible future, but a reality that could have been. “I think anachronism is... an important archetype for suggesting a parallel reality,” Farahani says. “It helps to suggest an alternate evolution of parameters, that things just worked out in a slightly different way, in this place.” There may be no magic in the TVA, but for some of us, the idea of a universe where beautiful old machinery still has a place and purpose is the most otherworldly thing of all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos picture frame speaker review: wall of sound</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The latest Symfonisk collaboration is another attempt to camouflage tech in the home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGcJ4x"&gt;Ikea and Sonos are back with the latest product in their collaborative Symfonisk series. The lineup’s purpose is to make technology — in this case, wireless speakers — fit in better with home decor and furnishings. After releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;a table lamp and bookshelf speaker&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, the companies have come up with a third act that doesn’t require any table, shelf, or floor space at all — because it hangs on your wall. The new $200 Symfonisk “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-white-50487329%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22573890%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;picture frame with Wi-Fi speaker&lt;/a&gt;” will be available at Ikea’s stores on July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P95gUR"&gt;The name is a bit of a misnomer since you can’t actually put any of your own pictures or posters inside this frame. “Wall art speaker” would be more accurate, but the end result is another attempt to camouflage gadgets with a more pleasant design that blends in with the rest of your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xj6vM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10649263"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DBsiO7"&gt;The picture frame is designed for mounting and comes with all of the hardware (bracket, screws, etc.) required for that. But you can also just prop it up against a wall and use it that way; Ikea includes silicone feet for this purpose, and there are preinstalled felt pads to keep the frame from causing any wall damage. Whether you hang it up or just stand it up on a shelf, it can be oriented horizontally or vertically. The majority of the product is made from plastic, but the front panel with the artwork is a polyester fabric. Three physical buttons for play / pause and track controls are located behind the left edge of the frame; the Ikea and Sonos branding is a visual cue for where to reach, and they’re easy to feel for after a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb5Mgx"&gt;Ikea’s default art design on the mesh fabric isn’t going to be for everyone. Artist Jennifer Idrizi has said that it’s inspired by the “structure” of music — the fade in and fade out. But on Twitter, the look has been mocked as something that’d be at home in a chain hotel, dentist’s office, or kitschy Airbnb. I don’t envy the challenge of making art that appeals to a wide audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFwJ0iZTwHr6rxucGeG2e0CXtP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712714/cwelch_210709_4665_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t like the default art, you can buy other prints to replace it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z5ohC9"&gt;Ikea plans to sell a range of different art prints for $20 each; swapping between them is as easy as pushing out the panel through the eight cutouts at the frame’s back corners. Some people aren’t going to love &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the selections, and I really wish you could order custom designs of your own photos. Unfortunately, that’s not something Ikea is offering, but the company says it will release new designs regularly. If the Symfonisk frame proves popular, maybe an aftermarket of prints will emerge on Etsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofvNZF"&gt;Another aspect of the picture frame speaker that people have quibbled about is the power cord. A piece of artwork with a cable running down the wall?! I can only speak for myself, but it really hasn’t bothered me in the slightest. The fabric-covered white cord — even the black frame comes with a white cable — is 11.5 feet long, so you’ve got plenty of slack for reaching the nearest outlet. If you don’t need all that length, there’s a little storage nook on the back of the frame where you can wrap up and store unneeded cable (with a Velcro strap to keep everything tidy). If you’re that turned off by the wire, maybe try to work some magic with a recessed outlet or just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cable+concealer&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"&gt;buy something to conceal it&lt;/a&gt; with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FC9Fg3rnmb1SWFxGKrTAD826dRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712717/cwelch_210711_4665_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The visible power cord bothers some, but I didn’t mind it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ssMTrr"&gt;Ikea and Sonos have put a lot of consideration into the frame’s design, and one of my favorite little touches is that there are several different cord routing paths that lead out of the frame, so you can have the power cable come down from the left or right side if dead center doesn’t work for you. It’s also possible to daisy-chain two of the wall speakers together with a cable (sold separately) if you want to keep things looking cleaner and spare a second outlet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JVPheumNqhDqCj2T9VIeF0J0Ky8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712712/cwelch_210709_4665_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The controls are located behind the frame’s left edge and easy to feel for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn8c-VEz78rjts4BIdn9h2w5G4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712715/cwelch_210709_4665_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the frame has built-in cord management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7N5u0"&gt;Since they cost the same, you might be wondering how the picture frame speaker compares to the Sonos One speaker in terms of sound quality. They’re actually remarkably close in performance. It feels like that’s the measuring stick Sonos uses for the Symfonisk line. The bookshelf speaker was 80 percent of the way there (for much less money), but the frame speaker is basically on par with the One — despite the latter having more depth to work with. There’s enough bass to give music the oomph it needs, but your walls aren’t going to be rattling at normal volume levels. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bmPTA3PJD7d-Z7Keny4jA6g085A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712709/cwelch_210709_4665_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t have much desk space to spare, AirPlay 2 support makes the Symfonisk frame a good speaker for any Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rSzSOB"&gt;Much like the One, the picture frame speaker is a rung or two above your average smart speaker (like the Amazon Echo or Apple’s HomePod Mini) in terms of audio quality. Sonos put a waveguide in front of the tweeter to help evenly distribute high-frequency sounds around a room, and in general, the hardware here is sufficient for filling most average-sized spaces. You can also use Sonos’ Trueplay feature in the iOS app to tune the speaker’s output for a particular room’s acoustics. There are no built-in microphones on the picture frame speaker, which is in keeping with previous Symfonisk products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjKMGCJZbmQcVz6stZoUjlOdyj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714459/app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setup is done with the Sonos app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OuJ1Qf"&gt;If you buy two of the Symfonisk wall speakers, they can be used as surrounds for a Sonos Arc or Beam soundbar. Ikea sent me a pair so I could test out how they perform at home theater duty, and I came away impressed. Once you set up the second speaker, the Sonos app automatically asks whether you want to use them for surround purposes with whatever Arc or Beam is already part of your system. Tap a button, and the three devices are grouped together for both TV audio and music. (For music in this setup, you can choose whether the picture frames output a subtle mix — letting the soundbar take the lead — or something more full and substantial.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WfEFoFKbiAavTMP3cMiJ4COEPIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712707/cwelch_210709_4665_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It does stick out from the wall quite a bit, but at least you’re getting good sound in exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nkc1_NmBL2s_WHe49iBHzSr_Rc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712711/cwelch_210709_4665_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonos added a waveguide to the tweeter to more evenly fill a room with sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8I2U7UOmWNF7itFTXFYblpn-So=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712706/cwelch_210709_4665_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea includes an 11.5-foot cord that should be enough to reach an outlet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYXCcI"&gt;Having a picture frame speaker handle surround sound is quite different from a Sonos One; the latter can be placed basically anywhere in your TV room on a shelf or stand for ideal immersion. If you’ve got the right wall situation for two Symfonisk frames behind your couch, you’re probably fine; other layouts might need some experimentation with placement and volume. They sounded great in my bedroom paired with an Arc and my LG CX OLED. There are settings in the Sonos app where you can input how far from you the surround speakers are, and you can also crank up their audio (separate from the soundbar’s volume) if they’re farther back in a room than surrounds ordinarily would be. The sound quality doesn’t disappoint, but you might have to tinker around with settings for the most satisfying results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="oWbcNt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10649840"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4GwGemKyCrT9noi-XHMT5ZXytaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712719/cwelch_210711_4665_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of sound, the picture frame speaker is very close to a Sonos One.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2p1ibx"&gt;The Symfonisk picture frame is fundamentally a Sonos speaker; you can play virtually any music streaming service on it through the Sonos app. It also supports AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect — though there’s no Bluetooth present, nor any 3.5 auxiliary input. You can group it with other Sonos speakers and play different music in each room, or have your whole system play the same thing in tandem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GDDdx"&gt;In terms of functionality and what it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;, nothing about the latest joint effort from Ikea and Sonos is new or unique. And unlike the previous two Symfonisk products, this one isn’t a particularly cheap way into the Sonos ecosystem. It’s purely about the form factor and aesthetic. If there’s a section of your house where a normal speaker just won’t work — or if you live with someone who’s not fond of having very obvious gadgets in every room, maybe this will do the trick. If you immediately jumped at the idea of wall speakers for home theater surround, the picture frame speaker won’t disappoint. You’d just better hope you and Ikea have similar taste in art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIQgGMPcQgVVFPvIMKOefOODmhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712713/cwelch_210709_4665_0011.jpg"&gt;
