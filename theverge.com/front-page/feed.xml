    <title>You probably can’t afford this hideous Gucci Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zCJ8r9t_o-gQirig83J6uHVX_0=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70134849/GUCCI_XBOX__0009_DSCF9034_02_1080x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are only 100 of these Xboxes available.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gucci&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sNo8JN"&gt;Microsoft and the fashion brand Gucci have teamed up on a ridiculously expensive Gucci-themed Xbox Series X that will be released in limited quantities next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvcZXP"&gt;It looks bad, in my opinion; the Gucci Xbox Series X has double G patterns plastered all over it, which I feel ruins the sleek aesthetic of the console’s original design. And it’s completely unaffordable to the average person, costing a cool $10,000, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fst%2Fcapsule%2Fxbox-gucci&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22778685%2Fxbox-series-x-gucci-suitcase" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Gucci’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mg6KEFYaAr83GE89AS5lPqQ3-eU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23010095/Xbox_Gucci_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gucci&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All this for just $10,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OFYc9Y"&gt;With that five-figure sum, you do get a few extras, including two Gucci-themed Xbox controllers, a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (though it’s unclear for how long), and an Xbox-branded suitcase in which to carry the console and controllers. And you’re also buying the exclusivity of having one of 100 of the limited-edition consoles. If you must have it, the console will be available November 17th on Gucci’s website and in select Gucci stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ala9AF"&gt;The Gucci Xbox is the fashion brand’s latest work in gaming, which also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340621/gucci-virtual-25-sneaker-ar-vrchat-roblox"&gt;virtual sneakers for &lt;em&gt;VRChat&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440134/gucci-garden-roblox-experience-metaverse-date"&gt;a surreal Gucci-themed garden for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a partnership with the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fst%2Fcapsule%2F100-thieves-x-gucci&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22778685%2Fxbox-series-x-gucci-suitcase" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gaming organization 100 Thieves&lt;/a&gt;. And Gucci isn’t the only fashion house getting involved with video games; Louis Vuitton designed skins for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20875541/louis-vuitton-league-of-legends-skins-summoners-cup-case"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, while Balenciaga worked with Epic Games to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22679754/fortnite-balenciaga-collaboration-epic-games-unreal-engine"&gt;create a whole world in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Game &amp; Watch is the cutest way to play classic Zelda games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aIih1sWZjQgeaYWu502LAzB_pls=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70134497/GameWatchTLOZ_photo_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zelda&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9l9f9"&gt;It’s not hard to play the original &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; games. With each new hardware release, Nintendo trots out its 8-bit Hyrule adventures again, giving players a chance to relive (and rebuy) the games that started it all. If you’re a Switch Online subscriber, for instance, you can play them right now on your Switch. Even still, there’s something pleasing about Nintendo’s new standalone Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld. It’s a niche little toy that does nothing more than let you play three classic games and keep track of the time. But it does a great job at it — and it’s so darn cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1hqAN"&gt;This latest retread of nostalgia is a sequel of sorts. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"&gt;amidst the height of next-gen hype&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo released a small plastic-and-metal machine that played the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; and doubled as a clock. Game &amp;amp; Watch: &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; is basically the same thing, but, you know, for &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;. It has the same tiny-yet-crisp screen, the same rubbery buttons, and the same metallic front that looks a lot like the original Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld. Visually, the main difference is the bright green color scheme and the words “&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;” printed on the front. Also, when the screen is on, a triforce is lit up on the back, which is a nice, nerdy touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TlfnLQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo’s new Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld proves the company goes its own way","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2JbyZk"&gt;Functionally, though, there’s actually quite a bit more going on here. Yes, the device still serves as a clock with a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; theme; Nintendo even turned the packaging into a stand of sorts, so you can prop it up on a desk. But there’s also a great selection of games. It includes both &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Adventure of Link&lt;/em&gt; from the NES, alongside the Game Boy classic &lt;em&gt;Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;. All three hold up pretty well (provided you can deal with &lt;em&gt;Zelda II&lt;/em&gt;’s punishing combat), and they look, sound, and control great here, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad"&gt;despite Nintendo’s recent emulation woes&lt;/a&gt;. The games all support save states as well, so it’s easy to dip in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQtCUB1M3aBFrVjyzu0MquyQ58A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23009984/GameWatchTLOZ_photo_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oRAXoB"&gt;In keeping with the theme, there’s a slightly remixed version of the mole-smashing Game &amp;amp; Watch game &lt;em&gt;Vermin&lt;/em&gt;, which now stars a stick figure version of Link. Rounding out the package is a deceptive mode called “timer.” Basically, it’s a countdown clock, but it’s also playable, essentially turning it into &lt;em&gt;Zelda II: Arcade Edition&lt;/em&gt;. You choose how long you want to play for (10 minutes is the max), select an &lt;em&gt;Adventure of Link&lt;/em&gt; location, and then spend that period of time trying to kill as many baddies as possible to get a high score. It’s surprisingly engrossing and a great way to kill a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfS758"&gt;Is all of that worth $50? That’s a personal question. There are certainly cheaper and easier ways to play some 8-bit &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;. But, just like with the M&lt;em&gt;ario&lt;/em&gt; Game &amp;amp; Watch, I’ve enjoyed the single-use nature of this machine. When I pick it up, I know what I’m going to do: get lost in Hyrule without distraction. Plus, it’s nice to toss in a bag knowing I have something to do when I need to kill a few minutes while I’m out. It’s something I want, not need — but for dedicated &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; fans, it will likely offer &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;enough for that asking price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genshin Impact’s creators have opened the door for commercial fanfiction writers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Genshin Impact" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/es6wYdrl_PVqtyetcfl4KLB01bs=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133775/50272117098_4902e671b7_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhKjjP"&gt;MiHoYo, the company behind the popular free-to-play game &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has given fanfiction writers the all-clear to create their own stories with the game’s characters or universe — even if they want to make money from their works (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-embraces-fan-creators-rather-than-suing-1847714438"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Commercialized fanfiction has &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction"&gt;long existed in a legal gray area&lt;/a&gt;, and MiHoYo making clear rules about how fans can sell it and physical merchandise is a big move for such a popular video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKW5VF"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/1372702"&gt;update to the rules for fan-made merchandise&lt;/a&gt;, posted on MiHoYo’s community site, the company said that “novels or stories written by fans” won’t need to be officially declared, “whether for profit or not.” That means that creators won't have to fill out any forms letting the company know they intend to profit off of stories written about &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ea2mwZ"&gt;Normally, writers working with popular franchises have to be very careful if they want to sell their work. While listing a physically bound version of your &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;story for sale online &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; won’t get you a cease-and-desist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311788/fanfiction-bookbinding-tiktok-diy-star-wars-harry-potter-twitter-fandom"&gt;some creators have acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that they’re relying on their small size to avoid being shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fm3QQV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Making fanfiction beautiful enough for a bookshelf","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311788/fanfiction-bookbinding-tiktok-diy-star-wars-harry-potter-twitter-fandom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hgvDu5"&gt;While the rules today create a bit of a gray area (does the word “novel” include printed books, or would those fall under physical merch?), it does seem clear that you could sell &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;-themed ebooks without any worries. With MiHoYo’s previous rules around merchandise, it was left unclear whether paid fanfiction of any kind counted as something you would need to seek advance permission from the company to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pikVuc"&gt;Fans selling physical merchandise at conventions or on sites like Etsy have often faced the same fears as fanfiction authors. For some of those people, MiHoYo is updating its policy to be even more lenient — individual fans selling items like T-shirts, cloth dolls, and fan art (but not statues or figurines) inspired by the game can now sell up to 500 units without having to apply for official authorization. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/381519"&gt;they were limited to selling 200 units without permission&lt;/a&gt;, which will remain the case for fan groups selling merch. In an FAQ section &lt;a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/1372702"&gt;of its post&lt;/a&gt;, the company also gives instructions on what to do if you end up going over the limit because you sold more units than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24BkTF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are limitations, but MiHoYo isn’t leaving it to fans to figure out what the company will and won’t allow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PBDwiH"&gt;Of course, there are still limitations on what you can do with &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;’s characters. MiHoYo says you can’t sell items that have actual screenshots from the game in it, you can’t act like the items you’re selling are officially licensed, and you’re not allowed to make anything that harms the reputation of the company or its game. Plus, if you are looking to get permission to sell hundreds of units, you can’t just ask to use all the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSWORs"&gt;While MiHoYo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warframe.com%2Ffan-merchandise-policy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22777194%2Fgenshin-impact-fanfiction-merchandise-rules-creators" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;isn’t the first company&lt;/a&gt; to allow creators to sell their stories and homemade merch, it’s rare that permission is provided so officially. The company isn’t ignoring its fans, letting them do what they want but without any assurances — it’s laying out a clear path for them to create their own work based on the company’s stories and characters. For those with a passion for the series, that’s good news; they can make and sell their own art without worry about getting in trouble for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Manchin blasts union-made EV tax break at Toyota event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rt6denjS1IO7OH8KalmGBGc4kTc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133766/FD7Q40MXsAMPykq.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Joe Manchin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NqLv4q"&gt; Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) wants to kill a $4,500 federal tax credit for union-made electric vehicles because &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/sen-joe-manchin-speaking-toyota-event-west-virginia-calls-union-built-ev-tax-credit"&gt;he thinks they’re “wrong” and “not American.”&lt;/a&gt; And he picked an awfully tone-deaf moment to say this: at an event hosted by Toyota celebrating a $240 million investment in its West Virginia facility, where he accepted three giant novelty checks for charity from the Japanese automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JaMSR"&gt;The $4,500 tax credit proposal would be in addition to the $7,500 federal tax credit that currently exists (and which the White House is trying to extend) for electric vehicles. It would only go to buyers of EVs that were made by a union workforce — meaning pretty much just the Detroit-based automakers. Toyota has &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/545022/toyota-ad-opposes-union-ev-tax-credit/"&gt;vehemently opposed the union-made tax credit&lt;/a&gt; along with Volkswagen and Honda. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-union-bill-tax-incentive-unionized-ev-makers-2021-9"&gt;spoken out against the idea&lt;/a&gt;. While the infrastructure bill is already on its way to President Biden’s desk to be signed, this particular tax credit proposal is part of the Build Back Better reconciliation bill that is still not finalized — so it could still change or be removed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WwPpbg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today I visited Toyota's Buffalo facility to see their new $240M hybrid transaxle line &amp;amp; to honor our Veterans &amp;amp; Gold Star Families. Toyota West Virginia has been a strong partner for 25 years &amp;amp; I thank them for their commitment to employing Veterans &amp;amp; supporting Veterans' orgs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/G1oHKNthU9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/G1oHKNthU9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sen_JoeManchin/status/1458833017036840966?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ylzeDd"&gt;As far as arguments go when it comes to Manchin, this one at least has a consistent logic to it. “The product should speak for itself,” he told &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re a capitalist economy that we are in society, then you let the product speak for itself, and hopefully, we’ll get that, that’ll be corrected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIf2T1"&gt;It’s the &lt;em&gt;Veep&lt;/em&gt;-level optics that stand out, though. Yes, the checks were for charity. But knocking the proposal at the same event held by a major company that also stands opposed to it is almost as bad as explaining why you &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/joe-manchin-leans-over-deck-of-his-yacht-to-tell-protesters-why-hell-oppose-funding-healthcare-expansion/ar-AAP69ej"&gt;don’t support expanded healthcare from atop your yacht&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s pick for FDA chief works at Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Confirmation Hearing Held For FDA Commissioner Nominee Robert Califf" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OsC7UuS5HuEU1vA-2BLFvq6Lhg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133597/497506844.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Robert Califf is expected to be Biden’s nominee for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. | Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JM51QQ"&gt;President Biden has selected Robert Califf as his pick for the next head of the Food and Drug Administration, the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/12/statement-from-president-joe-biden-announcing-his-intention-to-nominate-dr-robert-califf-for-commissioner-of-food-and-drugs/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today. Califf is currently a senior advisor for Verily Life Sciences and Google Health, two divisions of parent company Alphabet. He was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/alphabet-hires-robert-califf-ex-fda-commissioner-for-health-strategy.html"&gt;brought on in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to lead health strategy and policy for the groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0KlOL"&gt;Califf, a cardiologist, previously served as the FDA commissioner during the last year of the Obama administration. He also founded the Duke Clinical Research Institute, which runs clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzNI4x"&gt;“As the FDA considers many consequential decisions around vaccine approvals and more, it is mission critical that we have a steady, independent hand to guide the FDA,” Biden said in a statement. “I am confident Dr. Califf will ensure that the FDA continues its science and data drive decision-making.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvfrMp"&gt;But Califf’s relationships with pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Eli Lilly are already drawing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/12/fda-commissioner-robert-califf/"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; from consumer advocates, and they were an issue for a number of senators during his initial confirmation process in 2016. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted against his confirmation back then and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1459197346659676167"&gt;said in a statement today&lt;/a&gt; that he’ll oppose his nomination again, noting that Califf’s “significant ties to the pharmaceutical industry take us backward not forward.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZ4CFn"&gt;Califf’s ties to Alphabet could also be a conflict as the company pushes more aggressively into the healthcare space. Its health efforts include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534517/california-verily-testing-google-covid-inequity"&gt;Verily COVID-19 testing program&lt;/a&gt; (that fell flat and faced data privacy concerns), a Google tool to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;identify skin conditions&lt;/a&gt;, personal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379846/google-health-record-data-app-android"&gt;health records&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454817/google-hca-patient-data-healthcare-algorithms"&gt;machine learning projects&lt;/a&gt;. Alphabet relies on the FDA to clear medical features on smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436090/fitbit-sense-ekg-heart-fda-clearance-apple-samsung-withings"&gt;like Fitbits&lt;/a&gt; and a test wearable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18188910/alphabet-verily-health-ekg-feature-fda-clearance-clinical-research-google"&gt;from Verily&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fMs5J"&gt;Califf currently advises corporate leaders at Verily and Google Health about the clinical aspects of potential products, a spokesperson for Verily &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/12/fda-commissioner-robert-califf/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not yet clear if he would resign from those positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xiQFC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQtHDU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYdufE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel embraces the Sad Wolverine meme to announce X-Men ‘97, a new animated Disney Plus show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/orNxSkakq9-68q8NpXF_sgy3nA4=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133595/FEAcf4dUcAET6lR.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoGJKG"&gt;The classic&lt;em&gt; X-Men: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; is getting a sequel series on Disney Plus in 2023: the newly announced &lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which “explores new stories in the iconic ‘90s timeline of the original series.” The announcement was made in the most fitting of fashions, of course: the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wolverine-crush"&gt;Sad Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;” meme from the original show. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LdkCbwHwm0WEFw73faODjFqwkJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23009308/FEAcf4dUcAET6lR.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m5DAsR"&gt;Beau DeMayo will be the head writer for the upcoming show, with original &lt;em&gt;X-Men: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; showrunners Eric and Julia Lewald and director Larry Houston &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/this-week-in-marvel-exclusive-interview-x-men-97-animated-series-hits-disney-plus/?linkId=139874009"&gt;set to help consult on the show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3Jg7r"&gt;Additionally, returning cast members Cal Dodd, Lenore Zann, George Buza, Alison Sealy-Smith, Chris Potter, Catherine Disher, Adrian Hough, and Christopher Britton will be part of X-Men ‘97, although &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/this-week-in-marvel-exclusive-interview-x-men-97-animated-series-hits-disney-plus/?linkId=139874009"&gt;Marvel’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; notes that while some of those actors will be reprising their roles, others will be voicing new characters. Jennifer Hale, Anniwaa Buachie, Ray Chase, Matthew Waterson, JP Karliak, Holly Chou, Jeff Bennett, and AJ LoCascio are also set to join the cast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz1B4p"&gt;The revival series isn’t set to debut for a few years (animation takes time!), although the original five-season run of &lt;em&gt;X-Men: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; is already available to watch on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Drz8Og"&gt;The upcoming series is also set to be produced by Marvel Studios, making it the first X-Men-related project from the group since Disney got the rights to the mutant superheroes in its acquisition of 20th Century Fox. However, given that &lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt; will continue the storylines from the original show, it seems unlikely that it’ll be part of the interconnected web of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, despite being produced by Marvel Studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyb1oE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt; will hit Disney Plus sometime in 2023, joining a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22541074"&gt;crowded list of other original Marvel shows&lt;/a&gt; that Disney announced at its Disney Plus Day presentation, including &lt;em&gt;Agatha: House of Harkness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Freshman Year&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2miKH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Friday November 12th, 12:28pm: &lt;/strong&gt;Added additional casting and production details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel reveals Disney Plus slate including Agatha: House of Harkness and Spider-Man: Freshman Year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOv6yY_Ho-wq-49dPdtv6Xr5wmQ=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133556/slack_imgs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dq2ed4"&gt;As part of its Disney Plus Day — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22540942"&gt;which included a number of new releases hitting the streaming service today&lt;/a&gt; — Marvel revealed a big slate of upcoming projects, some new, some previously announced. That includes the official title for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s Agatha spinoff, and a new Spider-Man animated series. Unfortunately there aren’t any new trailers, but instead a whole lot of logos. Here’s the full list, courtesy of Marvel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="500Y36"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Echo&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a series starring Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez, who will be introduced in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m87riT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt;: a series starring Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams, a genius inventor who creates the most advanced suit of armor since Iron Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t8FKGd"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Agatha: House of Harkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;a series starring Kathryn Hahn as her character from &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;. Jac Schaeffer returns as head writer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8cqrxt"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;: a series starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull Talos — characters who first met in &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;. The crossover comic event series showcases a faction of shape-shifting Skrulls who have been infiltrating Earth for years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2Aw9sw"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;: a special written and directed by &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; veteran James Gunn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NZSs1W"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;X-Men ‘97&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;an animated series from Marvel Studios that explores new stories in the iconic ‘90s timeline of the original series. Beau DeMayo is head writer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0wElZu"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt; season 2:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the second season of the fan-favorite animated series. After enlisting the Guardians of the Multiverse to stop Infinity Ultron, The Watcher returns in season 2 of &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; to meet new heroes and explore more strange new worlds in the MCU’s ever-expanding Multiverse. Directed by Bryan Andrews with AC Bradley serving as head writer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O3pir3"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Freshman Year&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an animated series that follows Peter Parker on his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we’ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character’s early comic book roots. Jeff Trammell serves as head writer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="73ggTJ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I Am Groot&lt;/em&gt;: a series of original shorts exploring Baby Groot’s glory days growing up, and getting into trouble, among the stars. Directed by Kirsten Lepore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GofQgX"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Marvel Zombies&lt;/em&gt;: an animated series from Marvel Studios that reimagines the Marvel Universe as a new generation of heroes battle against an ever-spreading zombie scourge. Directed by Bryan Andrews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nyx2NA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Marvel Zombies, an animated Original Series from Marvel Studios, coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlusDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlusDay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Rv6AESN6d3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Rv6AESN6d3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney+ (@disneyplus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1459201152717783046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MdScjq"&gt;Those who have a Disney Plus subscription can also catch a first look of three upcoming live-action series on the service via &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fmarvel-studios-2021-disney-day-special%2F6o3sloKePurL&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 14-minute-long special.&lt;/a&gt; Most notably, it includes first looks at &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight, She-Hulk, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, all of which are slated to debut in 2022, alongside a new &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02IzDR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt; is described as “a new globetrotting action-adventure series featuring a complex vigilante who suffers from dissociative identity disorder. The multiple identities who live inside him find themselves thrust into a deadly war of the gods against the backdrop of modern and ancient Egypt.” It stars Oscar Isaac. &lt;em&gt;She-Hulk&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, follows the titular “lawyer who specializes in superhuman-oriented legal cases” and will feature guest appearances from Mark Ruffalo and Tim Roth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iejgv"&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, here’s how Marvel explains it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MPToNU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;introduces Kamala Khan—a 16-year-old Pakistani American from Jersey City. An aspiring artist, an avid gamer and a voracious fan-fiction scribe, she is a huge fan of the Avengers—and one in particular, Captain Marvel. But Kamala has always struggled to find her place in the world—that is, until she gets super powers like the heroes she’s always looked up to. Iman Vellani stars as Kamala Khan aka Ms. Marvel. The series is written by Bisha K. Ali and episodes are directed by Adil El Arbi &amp;amp; Bilall Fallah, Meera Menon and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BEEDx0"&gt;While none of the teasers give much away, they — coupled with the rest of the lineup — do show that Marvel is continuing to utilize &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fsubscribe-now%3Fcid%3DDSS-Search-Google-71700000058993695-%26irclickid%3DRgfSZFzslxyIRHnyqjWYSydRUkGxmxXflxjQxI0%26irgwc%3D1%26cid%3DDSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-Vox%2520Media-564546%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3dBoDWJXrDVwzeR5APtVTarczQ4WhI6tkPIVtKwBlFRLhxMopaTyLMaAlj9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;subid1=VergeMarvelDisneyPlusTitles111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; as a key space for ongoing stories through 2022. The studio has already had some big hits with the likes of &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wandavision&lt;/em&gt;, and on November 24th a series will make its debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaZU4V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4dFljI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NJIBjo"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5095084519&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCtrBf"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter, along with managing editor Alex Cranz and senior reporter Sean O’Kane, discuss electric vehicle startup Rivian becoming a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. This leads to a discussion on how Rivian got to this point where other EV startups have failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CZR77J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;Rivian goes public in one of the biggest IPOs ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xVDQnd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22774719/rivian-ipo-meme-stock-tesla-reddit-wallstreetbets"&gt;Rivian’s mega IPO is a good test of the meme stock craze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QP0FZb"&gt;There’s a whole lot more news covered on the show, especially from Apple. This week, we saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bBr0W9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;orders Apple to let developers add links and buttons to external payment options. &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1r6m8D"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update"&gt;Apple backed off its policy&lt;/a&gt; that made it harder for independent repair shops to repair iPhone screens. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9GgkyS"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772092/tim-cook-cryptocurrency-investment"&gt;Tim Cook said at a conference that he owns cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YaL88s"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22766733/apple-tesla-hiring-former-autopilot-software-director-musk"&gt;Apple hired Tesla’s former Autopilot software director&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xMn2aS"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773024/apple-alex-gorsky-johnson-and-johnson-health-wearables"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s CEO joined Apple’s board of directors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1xMesl"&gt;We had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;a great photo shoot-out&lt;/a&gt; between the iPhone 13 Pro and the Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SF89S9"&gt;And surprise! More news. Microsoft had a few announcements this week as well: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WgHUFd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771742/microsoft-windows-11-se-features-release-date"&gt;Microsoft announces Windows 11 SE, a new Chrome OS competitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SZ5qiq"&gt;All of this and more were discussed on this week’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast. &lt;/em&gt;Listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full episode. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="JQ0pTW"&gt;When it comes to gaming chairs, most of the focus is on how they can support and comfort your next 5,000 IQ play, but the fact is that most of them are designed to be large and imposing. After teasing a miniaturized version of its Titan chair &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/pages/xxxxxs?"&gt;as an April Fools’ joke&lt;/a&gt;, Secretlab decided to send it to production, creating this &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/pages/titan-xxs"&gt;Titan XXS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rU4C3B"&gt;The Titan Extra Extra Small has matching materials and even a five-year warranty just like the full-size chairs, and it even has height-adjustable armrests. It has child-locking casters and supports up to 70kg (~154lbs), so it should be safe enough for pets, kids, or anyone else who wants a small seat in front of the RGB keyboard and mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAW3bw"&gt;The chair will be available globally in “limited quantities,” so if you want this 1:2 scale version you may have to decide quickly on a preorder. A black hybrid leatherette version is available for $299 while opting for Plush Pink or Frost Blue fabric costs $319. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X minifridge&lt;/a&gt; went from joke to sold out in seconds, and now I’m wondering which non-serious product will be next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok tics are a symptom of a much bigger problem</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Mental illness doesn’t work like measles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XSgKrq"&gt;Reports of teens developing tic-like behaviors after watching TikTok videos highlight something most of us don’t consider about mental health: symptoms can be social. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDCs5q"&gt;Since March 2020, specialists in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have seen a dramatic spike in young patients seeking treatment for tics, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teen-girls-are-developing-tics-doctors-say-tiktok-could-be-a-factor-11634389201?mod=tech_lead_pos12"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Doctors say most of the young people watched content from TikTok creators who say they have Tourette syndrome, one type of tic disorder. Top TikTokers film themselves involuntarily cursing, slapping themselves, making clapping sounds, and more. Cumulatively, #tourettes videos have been viewed more than 5 billion times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GphYFj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We learn in different cultural settings, even local settings, how to communicate our suffering.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXwMy"&gt;Some researchers have &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mdc3.13316"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; the sudden surge in TikTok tics is a “pandemic within a pandemic,” as the teens struggle with schoolwork, feelings of isolation, and even bruises and other physical marks from their tics. But TikTok isn’t &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the distress these teens feel, says pediatric psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/providers/allison-libby"&gt;Allison Libby&lt;/a&gt;, an associate clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Instead, the tics are a byproduct of anxiety, depression, and even traumatic stress. Far from dismissing these issues as “all in your head,” acknowledging how symptoms are shaped by a broader social context — and, now, by social media — could help teens find relief for more than just their tics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kWpeL"&gt;“Symptoms are a means of expression,” &lt;a href="https://anthropology.wustl.edu/people/rebecca-lester"&gt;Rebecca Lester&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of sociocultural anthropology at Washington University who studies psychiatry, religion, and gender, told me. “We learn in different cultural settings, even local settings, how to communicate our suffering.” That learning isn’t intentional — or even necessarily conscious. But the consequences can be debilitating.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE3LG0"&gt;Mental illness doesn’t work like measles, which manifests the same way wherever it goes. Because emotional experiences can vary dramatically across time and place, so can symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lyt5no"&gt;Take, for example, traumatic stress from war. Psychiatrists tend to treat World War I-era “shell shock” as a precursor to PTSD, a concept that was solidified in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. But the two groups of veterans often exhibited wildly different symptoms. Mutism, seizures, and paralysis were common symptoms of shell shock. PTSD, by contrast, is defined primarily by flashbacks. The further back in history you go, the stranger soldiers’ symptoms seem: in the Civil War, soldiers &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ptsd-civil-wars-hidden-legacy-180953652/"&gt;suffered from “nostalgia,”&lt;/a&gt; or homesickness, that made it difficult for them to breathe and unsettled their stomach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6uOYZ"&gt;There isn’t a “correct” stress response to war — or any other hardship. In every case, the soldiers’ suffering was very real. But their symptoms changed in part because their culture did. The plight of the TikTok teens suggests we’re in the middle of another revolution in the language of distress today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cySp8h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tics, in particular, happen to be very suggestible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kthyQD"&gt;Many symptoms have a social component, but tics, in particular, happen to be very suggestible, Libby says. In 2011, for example, as many as &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-students-twitcnew-york-h/schools-end-clears-up-new-york-students-mystery-twitching-idUSBRE85M0DF20120623"&gt;20 teenagers&lt;/a&gt; in upstate New York, almost all of them students in the same school, suddenly developed similar tremors. Explanations included environmental pollution and cancer clusters; Erin Brockovich &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html"&gt;sent a team&lt;/a&gt; to test local soil. Ultimately, doctors close to the patients &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; the physical symptoms were the result of psychic distress. Fortunately, by the next spring, many of the afflicted teens were on the road to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2C5ib"&gt;Just 10 years ago, teens were most directly influenced by the handful of kids in their homeroom; today, thanks to platforms like TikTok, the whole world can feel like one big high school. Earlier this year, German psychiatrist Kirsten Müller-Vahl and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awab316/6356504"&gt;introduced the phrase&lt;/a&gt; “mass social media-induced illness” to describe an outbreak of tic-like behaviors among German teens that began in 2019 and is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tourettes-youtube-jan-zimmermann"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a popular YouTube creator with Tourette syndrome. Add to that the COVID-19 pandemic, which more than &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/mental-health-and-substance-use-considerations-among-children-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt; of American high school students say has worsened their emotional health, and an outbreak of tics seems almost inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psohFX"&gt;So what happens next? The difference between true tic disorders, which typically emerge in childhood, and tic-like behaviors, which are what these TikTok users seem to be experiencing, doesn’t matter much for treatment, Libby says. Both groups will likely undergo something called comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics, or &lt;a href="https://tourette.org/research-medical/cbit-overview/"&gt;CBIT&lt;/a&gt;, to manage their symptoms. However, if there are other underlying mental health issues, those need to be treated, too. “My guess is that they will absolutely be able to recover,” Libby says, “especially if they are getting treatment for the underlying anxiety or depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uAVGqV"&gt;When it comes to the current spike in tic-like disorders, “blaming TikTok, it’s a cop-out,” Lester says. For these teens, the distress was probably already there. These symptoms just made it impossible to ignore.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
