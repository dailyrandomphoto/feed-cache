    <title>Apple is making it easier to delete accounts attached to third-party apps</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqpUG8"&gt;Apple will require developers that offer a way to create accounts in their apps to also offer a way to delete them, starting with app submissions on January 31st, 2022, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo"&gt;the company shared Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The account deletion requirement was originally announced alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;several other changes to Apple’s developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WWdtz"&gt;Account deletion is a minor convenience, but considering how often apps require accounts and how easy it is to delete an app without ending your relationship with the company connected to it, it’s welcome. Apple’s announcement suggests only that developers “allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app,” so it’s possible implementations of these account deletion features could bump you to a browser during some part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hb1xPI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Free yourself from third-party accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1HbSp"&gt;Apple has also &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul"&gt;confirmed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of its more prominent app reporting tool &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;that was spotted on iOS a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the “Report a Problem” button is available on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and also macOS Monterey once it’s released. The button allows users to report scams or offensive, abusive, and illegal content — even for apps they haven’t purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IkTIs"&gt;Apple’s made other recent tweaks to the App Store — like allowing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;the company’s own apps to be reviewed&lt;/a&gt; — but for a full look at all of the changes the company has made to its storefront over time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;check out our article running them down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly slows feature development for ‘reputational reviews’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TRG3g7fdx3pE1XLACuYZr4WBDUc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960457/acastro_180319_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OfOEy7"&gt;Facebook is slowing down the release and development of some new products and features to make sure they won’t bring more scrutiny towards the company or harm children, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-slows-new-products-for-reputational-reviews-11633535983?page=1"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The “reputational reviews” come as Facebook is facing backlash from the public and policymakers after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;a wave of reports&lt;/a&gt; citing Facebook’s own research showing ways Instagram could have a negative effect on teen girls’ mental health. Facebook was also slammed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;in congressional hearings&lt;/a&gt; by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shed more light on Facebook’s internal research, as well as its business model and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYePuo"&gt;Some of Facebook’s recent public actions and statements back up the idea that it’s being extra careful right now. In late September, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;announced it’s “pausing” work&lt;/a&gt; on a version of Instagram made for preteens, citing concerns (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;those raised&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting) that the public had about the project. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;In a Tuesday Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; responding to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;the whistleblower’s testimony before Congress&lt;/a&gt;, Mark Zuckerberg said the company’s leaders would be doing “deep dives” on its current work to get a clearer picture of how Facebook is trying to make “important contributions across safety, integrity, research, and product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FPvor6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zuckerberg pushed back against the whistleblower and WSJ in his post&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yG5EhO"&gt;Facebook has also pushed back against the recent reporting around it and against the claims made by Frances Haugen. In the post mentioned above, Zuckerberg called parts of her testimony “deeply illogical” and said that &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting mischaracterized Facebook’s research (echoing Instagram lead &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;Adam Mosseri’s comments&lt;/a&gt;).  Facebook also claimed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banned a group of ad transparency and misinformation researchers’ access&lt;/a&gt; to its platform because they improperly scraped data, a justification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612545/facebook-banned-third-party-researchers-inaccurate-says-ftc"&gt;which the FTC called “inaccurate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V24IoS"&gt;The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about added reviews during product and feature development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="boDoB4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook runs the coward’s playbook to smear the whistleblower","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"},{"title":"What’s good, bad, and missing in the Facebook whistleblower’s testimony","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Bw8Wzj"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Facebook is examining its internal research that could be potentially damaging if it made its way to the public, according to some of the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. This lines up with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/technology/facebook-instagram-teenagers.html"&gt;a recent report from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which noted that Facebook’s legal team had contacted a researcher about a past report and that another researcher was told by their manager to not run any queries that could appear suspicious. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s whistleblower report confirms what researchers have known for years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/70T0yOLoTaZRmclEMQIMyrrbB8Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960215/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7t7smo"&gt;For weeks, Facebook has stared down mounting anxiety over a leaked internal study about the harmful effects of Instagram on teenage girls — and Tuesday night, Mark Zuckerberg finally responded to the scandal personally. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;In an open letter to Facebook staff&lt;/a&gt;, Zuckerberg scoffed at concerns raised by whistleblower Frances Haugen, doubling down on earlier Facebook claims that the report has been misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFlHHv"&gt;“If we’re going to have an informed conversation about the effects of social media on young people, it’s important to start with a full picture,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We’re committed to doing more research ourselves and making more research publicly available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RK8LGq"&gt;But for researchers who study social media, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal study&lt;/a&gt; that sparked the controversy was mostly confirmation of what they already knew — that Instagram makes teen girls feel worse about their bodies, and that they blame the platform for anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xcjR0"&gt;Megan Moreno, principal investigator of the Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says Haugen’s interpretation of the internal research squares perfectly with other work done on social media, especially Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X998Ow"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I didn’t feel like it was tremendously surprising”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3PITK5"&gt;“For a certain population of youth, exposure to this content can be associated with diminished body image, or body image concerns,” Moreno says. “I didn’t feel like it was tremendously surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCB1Jt"&gt;In fact, social media researchers have spent around ten years gathering evidence on how teen body image is affected by social media. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X15002249"&gt;Studies regularly find&lt;/a&gt; that teen and preteen girls who use Facebook, for example, are less satisfied with their bodies and do more self-objectification. &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2013.0305"&gt;One 2014 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of around 100 middle and high school girls showed that those who spent more time with Facebook photos had more weight dissatisfaction and more of a drive to be thin. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272431613501083?journalCode=jeaa"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found that girls who spent more time online and on social media were more likely to diet. More recent studies on Instagram show similar findings: female college students were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144518301360"&gt;less satisfied with their bodies&lt;/a&gt; after seeing Instagram images of thin body types. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144516300936"&gt;A 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; of that same demographic showed that seeing images of peers and celebrities from Instagram led to more body dissatisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42Go5V"&gt;Facebook has defended itself by pointing out that Instagram makes other teens feel better about themselves — but that’s also been duplicated by other studies, and not all the researchers find it reassuring. Teens who are confident in themselves already might not be negatively affected by Instagram, Moreno says, or it may help their self confidence — but kids who have lower self esteem are still vulnerable to the negative effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2EOTU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UG2Brb"&gt;“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer,” Moreno told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re acknowledging that the people you harmed were already at risk, that suggests you’re uniquely disabling people that are vulnerable, I’m not sure that argument suggests that you’re out for people’s best interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbVAnC"&gt;The findings fit into a larger body of work on &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213269.2010.525737"&gt;other forms of media&lt;/a&gt;, like reality television and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2016.1250702"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt;. Teen and adolescent girls who interact with that content also tend to say they’re more dissatisfied with their bodies. They’re also more likely to spend more time comparing themselves to others, and that type of social comparison is linked to anxiety and fears around the way they’re judged by others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIG7oE"&gt;Social media, though, is unique in that users are seeing people they know. “There’s this sense that you’re comparing yourself to people that you’re connected to, in some way,” Moreno says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5jsxj"&gt;The Facebook data’s consistency with past research also makes it harder to explain away the findings, and cast doubt on the &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21072223-instagram-teen-annotated-research-deck-1"&gt;annotations&lt;/a&gt; Facebook made when it released the underlying report. The research appears from the published slides to be strong and carefully done, Moreno says. “The design is excellent,” she says. “Their study was designed in the way that I’ve seen many others designed, which again is I think a measure of its quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHKeyA"&gt;Facebook also argued that the data wasn’t representative of all Instagram users, that there were also findings about positive benefits from Instagram, and that the number of people surveyed in some cases was small. But while pointing out limitations is an important part of analyzing research data, the limitations here are similar to what might be seen in other studies, Moreno says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSyLmn"&gt;“Presumably, they got the data they asked for, they got exactly what they were looking for,” Moreno told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “but they didn’t like what it told them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="BJPY6O"&gt;

    <title>Medtronic issues ‘urgent’ recall of insulin pump controller vulnerable to hacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DOUNIAMAG-US-CANADA-POLITICS-HEALTH-INSURANCE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFX5U5vMxRCM8h1qlZuUTUUspac=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960095/1197447170.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by KEREM YUCEL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1H03Kp"&gt;Medical device company Medtronic issued an &lt;a href="https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/customer-support/product-and-service-updates/notice16-letter"&gt;urgent recall&lt;/a&gt; of the remote controller for certain insulin pumps because they’re vulnerable to hacks. It’s possible for someone to copy the signals sent from the controllers to the pumps and deliver or block a dose of insulin, which could be dangerous for diabetic patients using the pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBiGa3"&gt;In the recall statement, Medtronic said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that it wasn’t aware of any situations where this type of hack has occurred. The company was first made aware of the issue in 2018 after an independent cybersecurity researcher found the vulnerability and told users about the problem. That initial alert told users how to disable the remote control feature when they weren’t using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njJtXa"&gt;Now, the company says people shouldn’t use the remotes. “After further review, Medtronic has determined that the potential risks associated with the MiniMed remote controller outweigh the benefits of its continued use,” it said in the recall alert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmRq47"&gt;Medtronic also put out &lt;a href="https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/customer-support/product-and-service-updates/notice11-letter"&gt;a safety notice&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 warning about the risk of hacks in the same set of insulin pumps, the MiniMed 508 insulin pump and the MiniMed Paradigm family of insulin pumps. The Food and Drug Administration also got involved and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-patients-and-health-care-providers-about-potential-cybersecurity-concerns-certain"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that the agency was concerned about the potential for someone to hack into the pumps and change the dose of insulin delivered to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QefiVa"&gt;Experts have worried about the cybersecurity risks of insulin pumps for nearly a decade, since security researcher Jay Radcliffe &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826"&gt;broke into his own Medtronic pump&lt;/a&gt; onstage at a conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeCeyP"&gt;As more and more medical devices are connected to the internet and healthcare becomes a bigger target for ransomware attacks, worries about things like insulin pumps, pacemakers, and other products have only grown. “There hasn’t been a really high-profile case of a patient being killed or seriously harmed, but it’s just a matter of time,” Mike Johnson, a securities technologies expert at the University of Minnesota’s Technological Leadership Institute, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686000/medical-device-cybersecurity-hack-minnesota"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in September. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA shuffles astronaut crew assignments amid ongoing Boeing delays</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqavii"&gt;Two NASA astronauts originally slated to launch on an upcoming flight of Boeing’s new Starliner spacecraft have been &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-astronaut-changes-for-upcoming-commercial-crew-missions"&gt;reassigned to an upcoming SpaceX flight instead&lt;/a&gt;, as delays continue to push back Starliner’s next flight to space. Astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada were supposed to be among the first human passengers on Starliner during its first crewed flights in the coming years. Now, they’ll fly together on SpaceX’s fifth crewed mission to the International Space Station, which is slated to take place in the fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adPtgS"&gt;Mann and Cassada were first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17647474/nasa-commercial-crew-astronuts-spacex-boeing-dragon-starliner"&gt;assigned to fly on Starliner in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Mann was supposed to fly on the Starliner’s first crewed test flight, along with Michael Fincke and Butch Wilmore — a critical test to prove that Starliner is safe to carry people. Cassada was slated to fly on the next flight after Mann’s, Starliner’s first official crewed mission, which also includes NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Jeanette Epps. Both Mann and Cassada are rookie astronauts, while many of the other Boeing flyers have been to space before, except for Epps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JDfiRS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s unclear when any of these Starliner missions will take place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0VNFXX"&gt;However, it’s unclear when any of these Starliner missions will take place, as Boeing is still working on a valve problem with the spacecraft. With no end in sight for the fix, NASA seemingly shuffled around crew assignments so that Mann and Cassada could get their first taste of space sooner rather than later. “Nicole and Josh have done a tremendous job pioneering the training and path forward for astronauts to fly on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft,” Kathy Lueders, associate administrator of the space operations at NASA, said in a statement. “They have gained experience that they will take forward as they train to fly in SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and serve aboard the International Space Station.” The reassignment was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/nasa-likely-to-move-some-astronauts-off-starliner-due-to-extended-delays/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek7zix"&gt;Starliner is a Boeing-built spacecraft, designed to take passengers to and from the International Space Station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The vehicle is one of two made for the program; the other is SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, which launched its first crew of astronauts in May 2020. As part of the development process, NASA wanted each company to launch its vehicle on an uncrewed test flight, followed by a test flight with crew on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4p0T1"&gt;So far, Starliner has only flown once without passengers on board, and its debut flight did not go to plan. During its launch, the spacecraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;suffered multiple software glitches&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately prevented the vehicle from reaching the orbit it needed to achieve to meet up with the International Space Station. Boeing was able to bring the spacecraft back to Earth safely, but NASA launched an investigation into the flight, coming up with a total of 80 corrective actions the agency wanted Boeing to take before proceeding. NASA and Boeing agreed that the company would get a do-over mission, in which Starliner would launch again without people on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5uemM"&gt;However, it’s still an open question when that redo will take place. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing hoped to fly a passenger-less Starliner again this summer&lt;/a&gt; and even got as close as stacking the spacecraft on top of an Atlas V rocket on the launchpad. But the launch had to be postponed just hours before liftoff after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;Boeing discovered issues with some of Starliner’s propulsion valves&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the company took Starliner off its rocket and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623609/boeing-starliner-capsule-iss-launch-valve-troubleshooting-delay"&gt;transported it back to the factory&lt;/a&gt; to take a deeper look. There hasn’t been a solid update on when the issue will be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5nIi2"&gt;“We understand the agency’s need to make adjustments to get members of the current astronaut class flying experience on an operational vehicle while the development of the Starliner spacecraft continues,” Boeing said of the astronaut reassignment in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We fully support NASA’s decisions and remain committed to putting the safety of the astronauts who will fly on our vehicle first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYiPuo"&gt;Meanwhile, SpaceX successfully completed its test flights with Crew Dragon and has already conducted two full passenger missions to the space station, launching a total of 10 astronauts to the ISS. The company’s next mission, called Crew-3, is slated for takeoff on October 30th. SpaceX is also slated to bring home its second group of passengers, Crew-2, from the space station in mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHSV1p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo will reveal Animal Crossing’s next big update on October 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwBHHXSObM0pfO9CYMvXt9FZGog=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959874/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_OnlinePlay_SCRN_02_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mLg2J7"&gt;Like the &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; Direct before it, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is getting its own showcase coming October 15th. The &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account revealed the news, promising 20 minutes of updates and announcements of what to expect for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195022/animal-crossing-switch-sales-japan-famitsu"&gt;Nintendo’s bucolic hit of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z5zSsb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;[Announcement]&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimalCrossing&lt;/a&gt;: New Horizons Direct will air on Oct. 15 at 7am PT! Tune in for roughly 20 minutes of information about the content coming to Animal Crossing: New Horizons in November. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ACNH?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ACNH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gc7rfFoxpk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gc7rfFoxpk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Isabelle (@animalcrossing) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1445750713619943428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXOJrc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; has been in a bit of a new-content dearth. While seasonal items used to spruce up villagers’ islands are added regularly, new events have been a bit slower to roll out. This year, we’ve seen three new events: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250249/animal-crossing-new-horizon-nintendo-switch-festivale-update"&gt;Festivale party&lt;/a&gt; that happened in January, and May Day and National Museum Day, which both took place in May. To keep players occupied with new shinies, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; featured tons of crossover events featuring &lt;a href="https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/news/#!/free-update-for-animal-crossing-new-horizons-delivers-new-content"&gt;Sanrio characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288246/animal-crossing-new-horizons-mario-update"&gt;Mario items&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqvGad"&gt;This new update, scheduled for November, seems to contain the much-anticipated café. In previous Animal Crossings, the café was a place to casually chat with villagers during their off-hours while also letting players work in exchange for coffee beans and furniture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOHSVg"&gt;New Horizons Direct takes place October 15th at 10 AM EST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jWB5K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCRQw9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halide’s latest update brings the iPhone 13 Pro’s Macro Mode to older iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzUynfgZ0Yy2u-5dFqIZcRbXLGk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959756/macro_mode_halide.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Halide&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFyEUx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide/id885697368"&gt;Halide&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best photography apps on the iPhone, and the company has just updated its app with a new macro feature, designed to perfectly complement the new macro mode that Apple added with this year’s iPhone 13 Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlozy"&gt;But Halide’s 2.5 update doesn’t just add support for the iPhone 13 Pro’s existing macro feature that Apple made. It takes things a step further and adds a macro mode for older iPhones, too, using Apple’s Neural Engine for “AI-based detail enhancement,” which uses a neural network to squeeze extra detail out of the close-up shot, even when you crop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iK9cub"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10792972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iAwKxX"&gt;The “official” macro mode on the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max uses the new ultra-wide lens that Apple offers on its more premium models, which — unlike the ultra-wide on the regular iPhone 13 models or older iPhones — add an auto-focus mode that makes the ultra-close up photography possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBeYID"&gt;Halide is mimicking that effect in two ways: first, it determines what camera lens on your device can focus the closest, and then the app offers “sub-millimeter” focus control to get the perfect shot. Then, it uses the aforementioned “Neural Macro” feature to upscale the image, allowing for sharp photos even when cropped in by 2x or 3x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3O4TRY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not quite as good as the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s a fun tool to try&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LgNRc"&gt;To use Macro Mode in Halide, you’ll first need to update your version of the app to Halide 2.5 from the App Store. Then, tap the “AF” button to toggle off autofocus, which brings up the manual focus menu, where you’ll be able to tap a new flower icon to enable Macro Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npllIL"&gt;I was able to briefly test out a beta of the new update on my iPhone 12 Pro, and the results are pretty impressive. It’s still not quite on the level of the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro capabilities — there are still limits to what the older hardware is physically capable of doing — but it’s certainly a better solution than simply holding your phone close to your subject and hoping for the best and a fun tool to play around with. And while I don’t have an iPhone 13 Pro handy to test with further, Halide says that its Macro Mode enhances that feature for even better macro shots, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15mnFcycsVzK9vyP6wWxBWm6vo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905014/IMG_3350.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9MbsQ"&gt;The new Macro Mode addition works on any iPhone that offers Apple’s Neural Engine (which includes the iPhone 8 and all subsequent releases) and is a free update for Halide owners. Halide itself can be downloaded for free from the App Store with a seven-day free trial and can be purchased for either $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year subscriptions or a flat $ 49.99-lifetime price upfront. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chevy Silverado EV will debut at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logos Of The World" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bwf2pKDr7Y3xdU-parpv9klQcJU=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959711/1188353086.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JJQY37"&gt;General Motors will debut the all-electric Chevy Silverado at the 2022 Consumer Electronics show in January in Las Vegas, Nevada, as part of CEO Mary Barra’s opening keynote address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1ugbo"&gt;The Silverado EV will be the second electric truck announced by GM, following the pickup version of the resurrected Hummer. The Silverado is one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s much larger push into electric vehicles — an effort that GM described in greater detail on Wednesday during an investor event where it also announced a new version of its hands-free driver assistance system. It will be the first electric truck for the Chevy brand, though, and it’s sort of fitting that it will debut at CES, considering that the production Bolt EV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10725182/chevrolet-bolt-electric-car-ces-2016"&gt;revealed there in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wq0P6VbN7_l3wMrgPoOnTg83EOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905221/GlassRoof.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bn78m"&gt;The Silverado EV will be built on the same Ultium battery pack and electric drivetrain that GM is using to power the Hummer, the Cadillac Lyriq, and multiple other vehicles. The company claims that will let the electric Silverado travel more than 400 miles on a full charge. It will be sold in both consumer and fleet versions, much like the Ford F-150 Lightning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srxw5H"&gt;GM announced Wednesday that all-wheel steering will be an option for the Silverado EV, as well as a “fixed-glass roof,” which it teased in a photo. While it’s not as expansive as the all-glass roof on Tesla’s cars, or Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, it’s much bigger than a typical moonroof and hopefully won’t give GM some of the same adhesion problems that those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696482/ford-mustang-mach-e-glass-windshield-recall-roof"&gt;other companies have dealt with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y871J2"&gt;Otherwise, not too much is known about Chevy’s first mass-market electric truck, including when it will be on the market. GM has already made some big promises around its Ultium generation of electric vehicles, even while it struggles with its first generation thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677539/chevy-bolt-recall-gm-electric-vehicles-fire-tesla-competition"&gt;massive recall of the Bolt EV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM reveals Ultra Cruise ‘hands-free’ system that covers ‘95 percent’ of driving scenarios </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6W9iDW6po08Oxe_QtVhiPkcVM9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959707/acastro_200406_1777_gm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q6pXoZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750833/gm-ultra-cruise-super-cruise-adas-autonomous-tech"&gt;After years of teases&lt;/a&gt;, General Motors is finally pulling the curtain back on its next-generation “hands-free” driver-assist technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B97z3d"&gt;Dubbed Ultra Cruise, the new system uses sensors like cameras, radars, and lidar to control a vehicle’s steering, acceleration, and braking. GM says the system can be used on 2 million miles of paved roads and in “95 percent” of driving scenarios. Though which vehicles will get Ultra Cruise is still a mystery; GM says it will be available in a handful of premium vehicles in 2023, though the automaker wouldn’t disclose specific models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0liLyf"&gt;The news was announced as part of GM’s two-day annual investor event, in which GM also revealed its plan to double revenues by 2030 as it seeks to become a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700400/gm-ultifi-software-ota-update-subscription-facial-recognition"&gt;software company&lt;/a&gt; in addition to making cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U89XYL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Cruise will be available in a handful of premium model vehicles in 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7DBDx"&gt;GM’s first-generation advanced driver-assist system (ADAS), Super Cruise, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/cadillac-super-cruise-outperforms-other-active-driving-assistance-systems/"&gt;has been praised&lt;/a&gt; as a safer, more capable version of Tesla’s Autopilot, thanks to its camera-based driver monitoring system that ensures drivers keep their eyes on the road. GM says Super Cruise will “co-exist” with Ultra Cruise, with the former available in more “mainstream” vehicles, while the latter is reserved for GM’s luxury models. GM wouldn’t comment on the price customers will be expected to pay to add Ultra Cruise as an option on their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kulbit"&gt;Super Cruise, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/10/15224516/cadillac-super-cruise-hands-free-ct6-tesla-autopilot"&gt;debuted in 2017 in the Cadillac CT6 sedan&lt;/a&gt;, is capable of completely hands-free driving across more than 200,000 miles of divided highway across North America. It compares the vehicle’s position, taken from both GPS and onboard cameras, to its location in a lidar map collected by GM. Once the vehicle knows where it is and that it’s safe to activate, Super Cruise will take over both steering and acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="maWJeD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"GM’s Super Cruise getting fully automatic, hands-free lane changes and more for 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589285/gm-super-cruise-automatic-lane-change-gmc-chevy-silverado"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uDHhjm"&gt;By comparison, Ultra Cruise will be much more capable. GM said the system will cover “more than” 2 million miles of paved roads in the US and Canada at launch, with the capacity to grow up to more than 3.4 million miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mqhnnq"&gt;In a call with reporters, GM President Mark Reuss said Ultra Cruise would be able to handle “urban and rural” roads, in addition to stop signs, traffic signals, and other complexities that Super Cruise is currently unable to detect. “Ultra Cruise will do this in a slower environment, urban life as well,” Reuss said. “And again, we’ll have the maps out there to do over 2 million miles, moving to three and a half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FlOduf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite its enhanced capabilities, GM says it still considers Ultra Cruise a Level 2 system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCVCEI"&gt;Jason Ditman, chief engineer at GM, elaborated on Ultra Cruise’s capabilities. “Drivers will be able to travel hands-free across nearly every paved road, including city streets, subdivision streets, and rural paved roads,” Ditman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAhEEs"&gt;Ditman described Ultra Cruise as a “route following feature” that maintains headways and follows the speed limit. Ultra Cruise will also support automatic and on-demand lane changes, left and right hand turns, avoid close objects, and enable parking in residential driveways. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBeLe8SuCccIyOWuvVQOlw8Bm8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8301347/Cadillac_Super_Cruise_Hero_Shot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cadillac&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;GM’s Super Cruise was first rolled out in 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3EVUIV"&gt;Ultra Cruise-enabled vehicles will come equipped with lidar, which historically is rare for production vehicles thanks to the high costs associated with the laser sensor. “The sensing architecture is all new,” Ditman said. “There are additional cameras and radars, and we are adding lidar to the vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp2MTV"&gt;Ultra Cruise won’t be able to handle every driving scenario. Ditman gave the example of a roundabout as a type of complex road condition that the ADAS will not be able to navigate. A light bar in the steering wheel will communicate to the driver when they need to control, sending signals through escalating lights and haptic feedback. A voice assistant will also inform the driver when they need to take the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEs670"&gt;GM relied on lidar-scanned high-definition maps for Super Cruise, but Ditman said it wasn’t practical to map all 2 million miles of road for Ultra Cruise. “We do rely on similar map data,” he said. “However, we have a larger number of sensors that also observe the roads so when we combine the map accuracy with what our sensors see of the road geometry and the road markings, we’re still able to accurately place ourselves and drive the right nominal path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8EHp8I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Cruise won’t be able to handle every driving scenario&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsKpjk"&gt;Despite its enhanced capabilities, GM says it still considers Ultra Cruise a Level 2 system, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. At Level 2, the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration and deceleration, as well as monitor blind spots and even change lanes automatically. But it falls short of full autonomy because a human sits in the driver’s seat and can take control of the car at any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izXpaQ"&gt;Level 2 systems aren’t infallible. Notably, Alphabet’s Waymo abandoned its plans to develop a Level 2 ADAS after determining that a fully autonomous system would be far safer. And certain automakers’ advanced driver-assistance systems often fail when driving into sharper curves, &lt;a href="https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2021/07/06/iihs-adaptive-cruise-control-level-2-pilot-assist-adas-often-inactive-on-sharp-curves/"&gt;according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaGVQF"&gt;The federal government is paying more attention to ADAS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555666/nhtsa-autonomous-vehicle-crash-report-data"&gt;recently announcing&lt;/a&gt; that automakers would be required to report incidents involving driver assistance and autonomous systems within one day of learning of a crash.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Recycled plastic won’t solve tech’s waste problem</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t get at the root of the problem&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QgtV9B"&gt;Buying a gadget made with recycled plastic instead of brand-new materials might sound like an environmentally friendly investment, but it does very little to cut down on the heaps of plastic pollution and electronic waste that are trashing the environment and ending up everywhere — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689941/babies-infants-poop-microplastics"&gt;in our own bodies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMCt2c"&gt;Think of plastic pollution like an overflowing tub in your bathroom, says Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland who maps the international movement of electronic waste. “If you walked into that, probably the first thing you would do would be to turn off the tap — not grab a bucket and a mop, if you think of the bucket and the mop as recycling,” Lepawsky says. Turning off the tap equates to staunching the production of plastic goods. Trying to clean up a growing mess won’t address the root of the problem. “It doesn’t mean, don’t use a bucket and a mop. But that’s not turning off the tap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uQyxz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cutting down waste means cutting down consumption&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DICqxz"&gt;Cutting down waste means cutting down consumption. That’s something that can’t be solved with flashy new product offerings, even if those products are made with recycled materials. Companies need to sell fewer products that last longer so that gadgets aren’t so disposable in the first place. Hyping up recycling can actually stand in the way of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udR4SK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oceans of plastic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Holc0X"&gt;The scale of the plastics problem is massive. As of 2017, humans had produced 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic (for comparison, a rhinoceros weighs about 1 metric ton) — much of which can persist in the environment or in landfills for hundreds of years. Recycling has done little to stop that mess. Only 9 percent of plastic waste has ever been recycled, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found. People send at least &lt;a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/marine-plastics#:~:text=variety%20of%20applications.-,At%20least%208%20million%20tons%20of%20plastic%20end%20up%20in,causes%20severe%20injuries%20and%20deaths."&gt;8 million tons of plastic&lt;/a&gt; into the ocean every year, where it might end up in giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18175940/ocean-cleanup-breaks-plastic-pollution-silicon-valley-boyan-slat-wilson"&gt;garbage patches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15358950/plastics-arctic-ocean-microplastics-polar-ice-caps-birds-animals"&gt;arctic ice&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;bellies of sea life&lt;/a&gt;, and back inside our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689941/babies-infants-poop-microplastics"&gt;bodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0VAok"&gt;“We can’t recycle our way out of this problem—acute reduction of plastic products, recycled or not, is the solution,” Max Liboiron, an associate professor of geography at Memorial University who researches plastic pollution, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “​​Even the production of new plastic items that use some of these ocean plastics as feedstock will result in a net increase in plastic pollution.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e0txlz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can’t recycle our way out of this problem.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqO5rb"&gt;Take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684591/microsoft-ocean-plastic-mouse-recycled-sustainability"&gt;Microsoft’s new “Ocean Plastic Mouse,”&lt;/a&gt; which has a shell made with 20 percent recycled plastic. Any potential environmental gains that might come with that 20 percent recycled material could potentially be wiped out if the company sells 20 percent more mice, says Lepawsky. It’s a pitfall ecological economists describe as the “rebound effect” or “Jevon’s paradox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T52Bhh"&gt;To have the most impact, products should be made with 100 percent recycled materials. But that’s nearly impossible with plastic, which is why it’s pretty typical for companies to only use a small percentage of rehashed plastic in their products. Plastic quality deteriorates with each use. Because of that, it’s difficult to make a new bottle out of an old bottle or a new mouse out of an old mouse. Microsoft’s mouse, for example, required the company to create a new plastic resin that’s only partly reclaimed plastic and combines those beads of recycled plastic with new plastic, too. When all’s said and done, it’s more likely that a product will be downcycled rather than recycled. That means it’s used to make something that doesn’t require high-quality plastic. Plastic bottles, for instance, are often turned into thin fibers used in carpeting and fleece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rv6IYu"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="How to find the microplastics in your seafood|71885" data-volume-uuid="477f8b2b6" data-volume-id="71885" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-816" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kLvg6H"&gt;Even using 30 or 40 percent dirty plastic in the mouse probably wouldn’t be feasible, according to Claire Barlow, deputy head of the engineering department at the University of Cambridge who specializes in materials engineering and industrial sustainability. The quality of the dirty plastic just isn’t good enough, she says. It might not have the strength or durability required for the product, or it could just be too difficult to process. So the fresh plastics are used to make up the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgwqSX"&gt;All those weaknesses with plastic also make it more difficult to recycle something that’s already been made with recycled materials. There comes a point when plastic can’t even be downcycled anymore. When it reaches that point, it’s typically incinerated or sent to landfills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfsbg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plastic greenwashing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuRlE"&gt;Microsoft is far from alone when it comes to making new environmental claims with recycled materials. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538297/logitech-ergo-m575-price-release-date-news-features-trackball-mouse-bluetooth"&gt;Logitech&lt;/a&gt; has made a big push to sell items with post-consumer recycled plastic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666328/samsung-eco-friendly-sustainable-limited-edition-galaxy-watch-4-bands"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; is even making watch bands with “recyclable” and supposedly eco-friendly materials, including apple peel. The trend also extends far outside of tech to food packaging, fashion, and even toys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2VVZ6"&gt;Several factors could be driving that trend. The sheer magnitude of the plastics problem has brought it to more consumers’ attention. Plastics, which are made from fossil fuels, are also tied to another environmental crisis that’s come to the forefront more lately: climate change. Recent &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/two-thirds-of-north-americans-prefer-eco-friendly-brands-study-finds-51578661728"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that shoppers are thinking more about the sustainability of the brands they buy. Tech companies have come under a lot of pressure lately for the harm they do to the environment — particularly when it comes to their air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and water use. Employees at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874081/microsoft-employees-climate-change-letter-protest"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701431/amazon-climate-labor-activist-fired-settlement"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948057/google-workers-climate-change-demands-letter-greenhouse-gas-fossil-fuels"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and other tech giants have published letters pushing their companies to stop polluting and to stop working with fossil fuel companies altogether. While companies have announced smaller steps like using more recycled materials or fully offsetting their emissions — they haven’t agreed to meeting their employees’ more ambitious demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="42ZUut"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Without turning off the tap for plastics waste, smaller actions could amount to mere greenwashing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fQQ0FF"&gt;Without turning off the tap for plastics waste, smaller actions could amount to mere greenwashing — a term used to describe efforts to make something (like a brand) seem more eco-friendly than it really is while glossing over the real environmental harm for which it’s responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV36DP"&gt;One example of greenwashing, according to Cambridge’s Barlow, is the emergency of bio-sourced plastics that can be just as bad or even worse than traditional plastics. A majority of bio-sourced plastics, made with things like corn instead of oil, still aren’t biodegradable, she says. And raising the crops those materials are derived from might actually lead to more water use and greenhouse gas emissions than traditional plastics. “There’s a big question mark on those. When you probe, sometimes it’s fine, but most of them, it’s greenwash,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHp9Aw"&gt;Vague terms like “recyclable” also raise red flags for experts with whom &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210322005565/en/Razer-Commits-to-a-Greener-More-Sustainable-Future-for-All-to-Game-In"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; announced a goal earlier this year to make all of its products with recycled or recyclable materials by 2025. But a lot of things might be recyclable in theory but not in practice — like Amazon’s plastic shipping envelopes. Most municipal recycling programs won’t actually accept them, so consumers need to take the packaging to drop-off points for it to be recycled. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana"&gt;Few people actually do that&lt;/a&gt;, according to at least one survey by ocean advocacy group Oceana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9t8Nt"&gt;Meaningful action on the plastics problem will require much bigger changes. When companies try to tackle huge problems like climate change and plastic pollution with small announcements about recycling and changes to individual devices, Lepawski says, “It’s nibbling around the edges, dealing with symptoms and not systems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkrFPq"&gt;The Product Stewardship Institute and other environmental advocates are pushing for &lt;a href="https://www.waste360.com/generators/19-states-most-producer-responsibility-laws"&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; that would force companies to take greater responsibility for what happens to the devices they sell after customers are done with them. Companies would be required to take back items or shoulder the costs associated with responsibly disposing of them. In the absence of those policies, municipalities and taxpayers wind up carrying the financial burden — or the environment pays the ultimate cost if that’s where trash winds up. Municipal recycling programs are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219042/online-shopping-ecommerce-packaging-cardboard-boxes-recycling"&gt;recovering&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fenvironment%2Farticle%2Fchina-ban-plastic-trash-imports-shifts-waste-crisis-southeast-asia-malaysia&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22712435%2Frecycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;global shock in 2018&lt;/a&gt; when China stopped accepting most recyclable goods. With no one to sell dirty plastics to, some curbside recycling programs in the US shuttered or started sending more materials to landfills and incinerators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ocean Plastic Mouse and recycled plastic pellets" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Jh0CMovLcXKCEjnIuAQOK_0vPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869949/Ocean_Plastic_Mouse___Material_800h.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ocean Plastic Mouse and recycled plastic pellets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llFu0P"&gt;Still, experts worry that a hot market for recycled materials could keep the incentives and infrastructure in place for producing more plastics — whether they be recycled or not. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.sabic.com/en/news/30776-sabic-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-create-microsoft-s-first-product-made-with-recycled-ocean-plastic"&gt;partnered with Saudi Basic Industries Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (SABIC),&lt;a href="https://www.aramco.com/en/news-media/news/2019/aramco-sabic"&gt; a subsidiary of oil company Saudi Aramco&lt;/a&gt;, for its Ocean Plastic Mouse. Big Oil has tried to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21419505/oil-gas-price-plastics-peak-climate-change"&gt;push its plastics business&lt;/a&gt; as a growing line of revenue as efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cut into its fuel business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3Uq5e"&gt;Microsoft’s new webpage for the Ocean Plastic Mouse tells consumers that they can recycle their old mouse by mailing it into Microsoft — although there’s a disclaimer at the bottom that says its recycling program is only available in certain countries. Consumers concerned about the environment would be better off keeping their old mouse rather than recycling it and buying a new one, says Sydney Harris, policy and programs manager at the Product Stewardship Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xm6RWZ"&gt;“They’re creating new demand for a flashy new product that I don’t need because I have a perfectly functioning mouse right now,” says Harris. “That is not sustainable, inherently. I should be holding on to my mouse until it’s on its very last legs and stops working.” But even that can be hard to do when companies continually release new devices that might be incompatible with old accessories — like new laptops or phones with missing headphone jacks and different designs for chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wld8SM"&gt;When tech companies design things that quickly become obsolete, they drive another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309776/record-amount-ewaste-2019-global-report-environment-health"&gt;growing disaster&lt;/a&gt;: e-waste. E-waste contains materials beyond plastic like mercury and lead that can be toxic to people and the environment. Affluent countries like the US send much of their e-waste abroad, where it often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20992240/e-waste-recycling-electronic-basel-convention-crime-total-reclaim-fraud"&gt;winds up in makeshift recycling facilities&lt;/a&gt; that can put workers’ health at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T3nf0x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s actually very useful to brands to keep the attention downstream.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TZSHGM"&gt;The focus on post-consumer recycling ultimately shifts responsibility from companies to their customers. That will never lead to the type of deep, systemic change needed to stem the world’s waste problems, says Lepawsky. “Individual consumer action will never match the scale of the problem,” he says. Typically across industries, he says, there’s way more waste generated during the manufacturing process — before a product ever gets to market — than trash that consumers throw out. “It’s actually very useful to brands to keep the attention downstream on post consumer waste, because then it means the regulatory eye is kept off of their manufacturing process.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DV0Csd"&gt;There’s a lot of other things that big tech companies might also want to hide from prying regulatory eyes — from privacy and moderation concerns to employees coming forward about prejudice and abuse. But, hey, at least they can say they recycled something, right?&lt;/p&gt;
