    <title>LG will license its webOS software to other TV brands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oyc_CowuZJ91vN3WNAds3RY4YkQ=/239x0:3239x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68865091/Powered_by_webOS_TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5s8mw3"&gt;LG tonight announced that the company’s webOS smart TV platform will soon be found on TVs from other brands. RCA, Ayonz, and Konka are some of the companies that have already signed on. “This has the potential to reshape the TV business for both technology and content providers while significantly growing LG’s presence and prominence in the global home entertainment market,” LG said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16BZXX"&gt;The news comes after LG revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;a significantly overhauled version of webOS&lt;/a&gt; at CES in January. On LG’s 2021 TVs, the slide-up “blades” interface has been ditched entirely in favor of a more traditional scrolling home screen. I’ve seen a wide range in opinions from LG’s existing TV customers; some like the new look since it resembles a streaming device and seems easier to use. Others who’ve come to appreciate the more colorful and “fun” webOS hope LG will keep webOS 6 off their TVs from 2020 and earlier. I’ll need some more time with the software before I can weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDoP0N"&gt;But that redesign isn’t something that buyers of licensed webOS TVs will have to think about — at least not yet. LG tells me that the “powered by webOS TV” platform is based on webOS 5.0. So it’ll look just the same as LG TVs from the last several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgZip"&gt;In licensing its platform to other TV brands, LG is following in the footsteps of Roku and Amazon, each of which has joined with third parties to release Roku TVs and Fire TV Edition TVs, respectively. Here’s what LG says its partners will get out of the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P6RMyS"&gt;Licensees of webOS TV receive the familiar and highly acclaimed UX design along with a rich pool of features such as voice search and control, integrated AI algorithms, and easy connectivity that have earned webOS positive industry and consumer accolades. With LG webOS TV, partners also get a diversity of content options including access to global streaming service apps such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and sports streaming service DAZN as well as LG Channels, the company’s free premium content streaming service. Compatible TV models also include the dedicated Magic Motion remote controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NRW1dr7yHEVrobWLiM08L8XHpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324250/webOS_TV_Partners.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG has already lined up a number of partners for “powered by webOS” TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lhsvT2"&gt;What’s in it for LG? The company will have control over the TV software experience across more devices — and also take in more advertising revenue. Expanding webOS to more TVs will get the ad-sponsored LG Channels in front of new eyes. This approach also gives LG more user data to make improvements to webOS, which will in turn benefit the company’s own TV lineup. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California can finally enforce its landmark net neutrality law, judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPWnjZRUBCIuw4Ywj5gtgMnv3Po=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864908/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VtbpaX"&gt;Net neutrality &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;died a horrible death&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, but things have just turned around: California’s landmark net neutrality law — erected in 2018 but immediately blocked by lawsuits from Trump’s Department of Justice and the telecom industry — can finally be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH8xmV"&gt;That’s the verdict from Judge John Mendez today, who declined to grant the telecom industry the preliminary injunction it had requested. The case might not be over, but the law can go into effect — and the judge doesn’t think the telecom industry is likely to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cS8w0Y"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories/status/1364363591822962691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364363591822962691%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLEx &lt;/em&gt;journalist Mike Swift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1364363126934802433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364363126934802433%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;’s Eriq Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, each of whom had been following the decision live, Judge Mendez believes it should be up to Congress to say whether net neutrality should exist: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2CUceS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Mendez says it should be up to Congress, not federal courts, to regulate &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NetNeutrality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NetNeutrality&lt;/a&gt; "When you have to deal with legislation drafted in 1934 in 2021, I don’t think anyone is well served ...That is Congress' job. They have to keep up with what is going on in the real world." &lt;a href="https://t.co/4yceR9bbT4"&gt;https://t.co/4yceR9bbT4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Swift (@Swiftstories) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories/status/1364363591822962691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UJatyR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Judge addresses what he says is "elephant" in case: "There are political overtones... This decision today is a legal decision and shouldn’t be viewed in political lens. I'm not expressing anything on soundness of policy. That's better left to Congress."&lt;/p&gt;— Eriq Gardner (@eriqgardner) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1364363126934802433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqeooc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273185/justice-department-drops-california-net-neutrality-lawsuit-ajit-pai"&gt;The DOJ dropped its own lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; challenging the California law earlier this month, so the telecom industry’s possible preliminary injunction was the last thing standing in the way — for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qilicz"&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;acting chairwoman of the FCC&lt;/a&gt;’s thoughts on the matter: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pznARd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When the FCC, over my objection, rolled back its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/netneutrality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#netneutrality&lt;/a&gt; policies, states like California sought to fill the void with their own laws. Tonight a court in California decided that the state law can go into effect. This is big news for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openinternet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#openinternet&lt;/a&gt; policy.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1364369582325121028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0vfF0s"&gt;California State Senator Scott Weiner, who authored the bill, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364856200073219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364364856200073219%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;is celebrating&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2p1SwA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SB 822 is the strongest net neutrality law in the nation. We worked incredibly hard to pass this law, overcoming massive corporate opposition. California can now fully protect an open internet.&lt;/p&gt;— Senator Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364856200073219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWwfFI"&gt;And so am I, as a California resident who knows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;it’s past time to fix the internet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvGSJB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB822"&gt;Here’s the full text&lt;/a&gt; of the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018, also known as SB-822. It contains a list of things that ISPs are not going to be able to do, including paid prioritization, “zero-rating” favorable content so it doesn’t count against your data cap (think of those bundled streaming services!), and failing to tell you fast service actually is and how their network management practices and speeds actually work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop’s CFO has resigned because of course he did</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHtCO5W5xy1dD5TZSTjrUmQ4ieU=/0x0:2603x1735/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864733/gamestop_sean_hollister_stock_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDe169"&gt;GameStop CFO Jim Bell &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/23/2180940/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Resignation-of-CFO-and-Succession-Plan-to-Support-Transformation.html"&gt;has resigned&lt;/a&gt;, and will be leaving the video game retailer for good on March 26th. That’s just over a month from now. GameStop also announced a “succession plan,” just in case it can’t immediately find anyone suitable to accelerate a mall-based video game retailer’s transformation into the post-pandemic future. We can only speculate on the reasons for his departure, but &lt;em&gt;let’s just come out and say what everyone is thinking: &lt;/em&gt;STONKS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fj0qqi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What did we learn from the GameStop mess?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22278890/jon-fortt-cnbc-anchor-interview-gamestop-stock-wallstreetbets-reddit"},{"title":"Robinhood, Reddit, Melvin Capital and u/DeepFuckingValue get questioned by Congress","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290110/house-financial-services-robinhood-gamestop-squeeze-roaringkitty-hearing"},{"title":"Reddit’s lead GameStop hypebeast is being sued for his role in the stock surge","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287612/reddit-wallstreetbets-gamestop-lawsuit-roaring-kitty-gill-market-manipulation"},{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"},{"title":"Please GameStop it, Hollywood","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cgovy2"&gt;It’s not like he had a falling-out with the company: “Mr. Bell’s resignation was not because of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices, including accounting principles and practices,” writes GameStop in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638021000024/gme-20210223.htm"&gt;this SEC filing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvC0jw"&gt;What I want to know: did &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oI_8YG6Vs"&gt;the Tendieman&lt;/a&gt; come for Bell? If not, perhaps he can still get a producer credit on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;the umpteen GameStock films&lt;/a&gt;, or a nice book deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley is now a cooperative board game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQuTEoQc3_oukXHOEp5XRYaIn-E=/45x0:1395x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864499/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_2.30.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QfEfbY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; has been adapted into board game form and is available to purchase now for $55, according to the game’s developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1364322680804057090"&gt;Eric Barone (ConcernedApe)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; got its start as a popular, indie-take on farm sim classic &lt;em&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/em&gt;, but now the video game will finally exist in physical form (without the need to go out and actually learn how to farm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXMB4V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; was developed over two years by Barone and board game designer Cole Meideros. The game aims to adapt the gameplay from the video game like farming, foraging, mining, and romance, into a customizable, but less open-ended form that you can actually finish in one sitting. The game is also designed for one to four players, meaning that just like the original game, you can play alone if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LLHint"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/31Sz4vMWYes?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQiJIV"&gt;Finishing the game requires completing “Grandpa’s Goals” and the Community Center bundles that you might already be familiar with from the video game version. Players complete tasks and collect resources by taking turns positioning their pawns around the board and engaging in an activity of their choice. Mining at the mines, fishing at the beach foraging in the wilderness, and of course, farming at the farm. The seasons advance one week at a time each round, meaning time and available resources change as the seasons do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rstE3A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-the-board-game-available-now/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the board game, Barone stresses that it was designed to feature some amount of depth and complexity. “It’s easy to play once you learn the rules, but it’s not a short, casual game.” he says. He also provided &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3x4p8nw2yr1a3j/Stardew%20Rules%20for%20Download.pdf?dl=0"&gt;the rulebook&lt;/a&gt; so you can get a better sense of how difficult it is to set up and how many other mechanics there are to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yp3px"&gt;While the board game doesn’t initially seem as approachable as the video game it’s based on, the amount of detail that went into recreating &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; in physical form seems really impressive. You can purchase &lt;a href="https://shop.stardewvalley.net/products/stardew-valley-the-board-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; now for $55&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVgRt2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original voice of Siri makes an appearance in Persona 5 Strikers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FELCDkDxuCkGK86h9BnooNh781Q=/284x0:2597x1542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864292/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_1.39.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Solax Archive on YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njXIJQ"&gt;If you’ve spent the day playing through &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; and noticed the voice of the in-game digital assistant sounded familiar, it’s likely because it’s played by the original voice of Siri (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-strikers-got-siris-original-voice-actor-to-pl-1846337639"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Susan Bennett originally provided the voice for Apple’s digital assistant, and now she’s playing EMMA, the in-game AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJbVD0"&gt;You can hear what she sounds like in the role in the video below, around the 9:44 mark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="V9oBKz"&gt;If you ask your iPhone for directions to the nearest camping store, though, you may notice that its response doesn’t exactly sound like the game. That’s because, while Bennett was the original voice for Siri when it debuted with the iPhone 4S running iOS 5 (though technically Siri existed with Bennett’s voice before it was ever added to the iPhone), &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/04/tech/mobile/bennett-siri-iphone-voice"&gt;she was replaced with the launch of iOS 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can also watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIn5DZU_NoA"&gt;Apple’s ad that introduces Siri on the iPhone 4S&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for what Siri sounded like back then in case its current iteration has overwritten those memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="52dK8d"&gt;This is the kind of extra mile we love to see game developers go. “We need someone to play the voice assistant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/resolutionroute/status/1363937521995042817?s=20"&gt;in the English version of the game&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>USPS unveils next-generation mail truck with electric drivetrain option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6M2BpES99bGf7SKxeHXTeico5w=/447x227:2560x1636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864219/suburb2_9_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Otto1P"&gt;The United States Postal Service (USPS) &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-postal-service-awards-contract-to-launch-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet-301233896.html"&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt; its new mail truck after a years-long competition. The new truck will be built by Wisconsin-based defense contractor Oshkosh and can be fitted with both gasoline and electric drivetrains. But it won’t hit the road until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AazfM0"&gt;Oshkosh winning the contract is a potentially major blow to commercial electric vehicle startup Workhorse, which was one of the three remaining bidders. The company’s stock price plummeted following the announcement, and trading was halted multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjbnuN"&gt;The USPS has been looking to replace its existing mail trucks for years now, and it started taking solicitations for new designs back in 2015. The need for new trucks is urgent. The ones currently on the road are not only woefully out of date — they don’t even have air conditioning — but &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-postal-service-mail-trucks-hundreds-catching-fire-age-delivery-2020-7"&gt;they’re a major fire risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZFAgY"&gt;The switchover was supposed to start happening in 2018, but the program experienced multiple setbacks. The USPS repeatedly extended deadlines in the early going at the request of the bidding manufacturers, and then when they finally delivered the first prototypes, many of them were faulty, &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;according to an Inspector-General report released last August&lt;/a&gt;. The program was hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;further delays once the COVID-19 pandemic hit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSbPnO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More cargo space, air conditioning, and hopefully fewer fires&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0dpdZU"&gt;The new truck has more cargo space, better ergonomics, and, yes, air conditioning. It’s also dotted with cameras that give a 360-degree view, helping power a front- and rear-collision avoidance system with visual and audio warnings as well as automatic braking. The big front windshield and low hood should also give drivers a much better view of the road and pedestrians or cyclists, which is a big improvement for the safety of people outside the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANIrLe"&gt;Oshkosh still has to finalize the design of the mail truck, which is part of the reason for the two-year wait. The defense contractor is getting a $482 million investment up front and is promising to make between 50,000 to 165,000 of the trucks over 10 years. Oshkosh had been working with Ford during the bidding process, but it’s unclear whether Ford was still involved in the final product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qWq6d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10358184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBBgP5"&gt;The USPS and Oshkosh don’t say exactly how many of the trucks will be gas-powered and how many will be electric, just that the plan is to make both and that the vehicles will be designed in a way so that the powertrains can be switched to electric over time. The USPS says the gas engines will be “fuel efficient low-emission” but did not specify what it means by those terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqvBDw"&gt;President Biden said in January that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;wants to replace the entire government fleet to electric drivetrains&lt;/a&gt;, though that won’t be possible without the USPS, which accounts for about a third of those vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYY0gs"&gt;“It’s disappointing that today’s announcement does not immediately commit to electrifying one of our nation’s largest vehicle fleets,” Robbie Diamond, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, said in a statement. “This contract is a golden opportunity to stimulate the domestic EV market and supply chain, and a commitment to electrifying the [postal fleet] would provide a clear incentive for further domestic EV industry development along the entire supply chain, from minerals to markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNcDd5"&gt;Workhorse was the last remaining bidder pitching a fully electric vehicle, and it put a lot of effort into surviving as a business just to make it to the end of this process. The company sold off a small drone division, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"&gt;ostensibly spun out a new startup in Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt; to make an electric pickup truck without Workhorse’s baggage, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;even paid $7 million to buy out its original partner in the bid&lt;/a&gt;, trucking manufacturer VT Hackney. Workhorse even &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000162828020014517/ex-101indenture.htm"&gt;tailored the fine print of a recent loan&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that it would pay less interest if it won the USPS contract. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now listen to WandaVision’s latest spoiler-filled bop on Spotify and Apple Music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7c5zLAGmBRA4Zk-U0Ij0BwGtns4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864153/wan_still_105_02_8a82d395.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7XLyxW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s seventh episode&lt;/a&gt; started to answer some of the biggest questions of the series, and — in line with its sitcom trappings — the show dropped one of its biggest reveals yet in a &lt;em&gt;very spoiler-y&lt;/em&gt; retro-style theme song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enkdac"&gt;Since the episode was released, the track has exploded in popularity to the point that Disney seems to have noticed by dropping the official soundtrack on services like Spotify and Apple Music a few days ahead of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1364329004573016067"&gt;planned release&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, February 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMfCic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; episode 7 ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wgCsog"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WandaVision’s seventh episode answers two big questions but introduces many more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7dMZuy"&gt;That’s right, you can now stream the official version of “Agatha All Along” to your heart’s content. The song, like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s other sitcom themes, was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez (best known for their work on the &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt; soundtracks) featured at the end of the most recent episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h327Ni"&gt;“Agatha All Along” reveals that nosy neighbor “Agnes” is in fact the witch Agatha Harkness — who, as the song makes clear in an incredibly catchy manner, was behind at least some of the oddities of Westview all along as the villain of the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uXB0vL"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; padding-top: 80px;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0kHsXoIt6dONEdkgKgyjoK" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LJRiM"&gt;Since the episode was released, the song has already become a TikTok trend, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lelandphilpot/status/1363286213390696455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;received a trap remix&lt;/a&gt;, and been re-created as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGS7TYmIZOQ"&gt;soaring orchestral number&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the kind of popularity that brings to mind another musical streaming hit: the massively viral “Toss A Coin To Your Witcher” from Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KHa3Dq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix blew the release for ‘Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,’ the hit song of the season","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="imnPBS"&gt;That song had similarly exploded in popularity across the internet when &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; was released, but it took Netflix over a month to get its act together and release an official version of the soundtrack on streaming services, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"&gt;almost entirely missing the moment&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a mistake that the streamer hasn’t made since, and the viral soundtracks to more recent shows — like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fbridgerton-covers-from-the-netflix-original-series-ep%2F1544579825&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F23%2F22297497%2Fwandavision-spoiler-episode-7-soundtrack-song-disney-plus-spotify-apple-music" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;’s pop culture covers&lt;/a&gt; — have been available alongside the series’s debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPwTii"&gt;With the early release of the soundtrack, it seems that Disney has made a similar choice to ride the wave and not let “Agatha All Along” pass it by, even if it means bumping up a few release dates — until the next &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; theme song takes over TikTok, that is. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn is back up after an outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World Economy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zM6hGbIUlOVFBq2dN6Df6oigPOw=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863105/1229893855.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gZ6ecW"&gt;LinkedIn is back up after a worldwide outage affecting users on both mobile and desktop. The Microsoft-owned social network first started experiencing issues around 2PM ET, and LinkedIn confirmed things were back to normal at 4:21PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djJPYL"&gt;The company didn’t give a specific reason for the outage, though did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529"&gt;jokingly suggest&lt;/a&gt; the issues may have been due to a &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFhyA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pardon the interruption everyone. We're back on track now. Unconfirmed reports indicate it might have been Agatha all along.  &lt;/p&gt;— LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="044dPn"&gt;It’s rare for LinkedIn to experience outages. LinkedIn last experienced widespread issues in January last year, when users weren’t able to post to the service or make new connections. Today’s outage affected the entire website, and it wasn’t loading for most users at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7Qc7R"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 23rd, 5:08PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: LinkedIn is back up, so we have updated the headline and article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square goes even bigger on bitcoin with a new $170 million investment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFcd3LQW2nk9OTv8ok8LwSSZMjM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864110/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjrdYk"&gt;Square has just made another colossal investment in bitcoin, more than tripling its last investment in the cryptocurrency with a $170 million purchase of tokens. The digital payments company, which is run by vocal bitcoin advocate and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, disclosed the investment in its &lt;a href="https://investors.squareup.com/news/news-details/2021/Square-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;quarterly earnings report on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYhadu"&gt;The company purchased about 3,318 bitcoins at an average price of $51,236, which signals remarkable confidence in bitcoin as it reaches record heights and invites renewed skepticism about its stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCq6AP"&gt;“Aligned with the company’s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,” reads the company’s press release announcing the purchase. “The investment is part of Square’s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xz6YI4"&gt;Square first announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;major bitcoin investment in October of last year&lt;/a&gt; when it purchased $50 million worth of tokens when a single bitcoin cost a little over $10,000. The current price of a single bitcoin is just under $50,000, following a slight dip after the currency’s months-long &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-slides-6-below-55-101731416.html"&gt;surge to an eventual all-time high&lt;/a&gt; of just over $58,000 earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung now lets you return a new Galaxy Z Fold 2 or Z Flip foldable after 100 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUiqDAVQreHNadozWuHKui33ck4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863967/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gtd5Xt"&gt;Samsung is extending the return period for its newest foldable phones to 100 days, the company announced on Tuesday. That means buyers of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G and Z Flip 5G can purchase either device, use it for more than three months, and return it for a full refund. Samsung is calling this new program “Buy and Try,” and it’s the first time the company has launched a return initiative as generous as this for its mobile phones. The prior return window was 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJTHTD"&gt;“This new initiative will help consumers try and see if a foldable device is right for them, as part of Samsung’s commitment to making foldable devices more accessible for everyone,” a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement. Samsung says the program is launching today for purchases of either device made through its website and will run until April 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUTGlw"&gt;The Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G&lt;/a&gt; is technically the fourth iteration of the company’s foldable line, and it released last fall as a vastly improved version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;original (and severely flawed) Galaxy Fold&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $1,999.99, though Samsung is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling the device on its website for $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt; with an eligible trade-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLIyhF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt; is Samsung’s third take on a foldable phone. Following a discount, it now retails for $1,199.99, though Samsung says you can &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/buy/?link=galaxy-z-flip-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get one for as cheap as $649.99 with an eligible trade-in&lt;/a&gt;. Both store pages for the devices on Samsung’s website carry notices of the new 100-day return offer. &lt;/p&gt;
