    <title>Google’s parent company briefly hits $2 trillion valuation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="donwQi"&gt;Alphabet, Google’s parent company, briefly hit a market cap of $2 trillion. The tech behemoth’s market cap is currently at a comfortable &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/"&gt;$1.98 trillion&lt;/a&gt;, but crept over the $2 trillion mark midday Monday, later closing out at $2,987.03 per share. Alphabet’s market cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft"&gt;has just about doubled from $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYD6gc"&gt;In the third quarter of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;Alphabet had a record quarter&lt;/a&gt;, earning a hefty $65.1 billion. The company reported that its revenue soared by 41 percent, while its profits jumped by almost 69 percent. Google Search saw a slight increase in profit, climbing to $37.9 billion from $35.8 billion in the previous quarter. YouTube, another Alphabet company, earned $7.2 billion in the most recent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZfgjj"&gt;Throughout the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;Big Tech has boomed&lt;/a&gt;, and as companies across the world shifted from in-person workplaces to remote, cloud-based work environments, Google benefited in the form of cloud storage subscriptions and digital ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0AVpq"&gt;Alphabet nearly joined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549559/microsoft-2-two-trillion-dollar-market-cap-close"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; as one of three US-based companies that are part of the exclusive $2 trillion club. Apple hit the mark in April of last year, while Microsoft reached $2 trillion this past June. Amazon is close to joining the $2 trillion club, but its current &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/"&gt;$1.7 trillion valuation&lt;/a&gt; falls just a bit short.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will accept app updates during the holidays in a break from tradition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CU1xBkVKfIedRlJVIq9t5ajRmxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113689/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Wv2PC"&gt;Apple will continue to accept App Store app submissions through the holidays, marking a shift from the company’s approach in the past. Typically, Apple doesn’t let developers make submissions through the App Store Connect portal for a few days around Christmas, meaning that they would have to rush to release apps or updates ahead of when many people receive new Apple devices or gift cards as holiday presents. With this change, it seems as if the App Store will hum along largely like you’re used to this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6TMFv"&gt;However, Apple is already suggesting that developers try to stay ahead of things during one of the busiest times of the year. “Due to anticipated high volume, plan to send time-sensitive submissions early,” Apple said in a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y4fgrhhe&amp;amp;1636388143"&gt;short post on its developer website&lt;/a&gt;. “Please note that reviews may take longer to complete from November 24 to 28 and December 23 to 27.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Controversial Bitcoin tax provision passes Congress with infrastructure bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBfPD6gJ2r7V2wGpR8sGHc61FQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113609/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S8EPb5"&gt;On Friday, Congress passed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for his signature. But while the measure makes historic investments in roads and bridges, it also maintains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631096/cryptocurrency-tax-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-advocacy-jack-dorsey-ashton-kutcher"&gt;a controversial new cryptocurrency tax reporting requirement&lt;/a&gt; that the Treasury Department could apply to miners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sxotp"&gt;Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires brokers to report trader information on transactions of more than $10,000 to the IRS. The provision was added to the Senate version of the bill in late July after the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would offset $28 billion of infrastructure costs over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIET6t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would offset $28 billion of infrastructure costs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MlfN2"&gt;But the cryptocurrency community is more concerned about how the bill defines a “broker” more than the new tax requirements it imposes on them. Industry groups and think tanks, like the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center, have argued that the bill’s current language is “too broad and vague” and could impose these reporting requirements to miners and wallet developers, not just brokers like Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mDWbe"&gt;Senators that are sympathetic to the cryptocurrency industry, like Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), tried to remedy the problem over the summer before the Senate passed the bill, joining with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) for an amendment clarifying the role of brokers in the legislation. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617055/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-deal-reporting-lummis-wyden-schumer"&gt;the amendment was shot down&lt;/a&gt; when Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) objected to a unanimous motion to approve it in August. Shelby previously chaired the Senate Banking Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xy9iT6"&gt;Shortly after the Senate’s passage of the bill, the bipartisan Blockchain Caucus &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1424845416697323522?s=20"&gt;sent a letter to every House lawmaker&lt;/a&gt; calling on them to help fix the “crypto pay-for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWQvQd"&gt;“Cryptocurrency tax reporting is important, but it must be done correctly,” the lawmakers wrote in the August letter. “When the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act comes to the House, we must prioritize amending this language to clearly exempt noncustodial blockchain intermediaries and ensure that civil liberties are protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Aj6xA"&gt;Despite any efforts to change the language in the House, the problematic broker definition remains in the final bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZZ863"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Treasury Department will have the sole authority to decide what entities would be considered brokers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bqytrn"&gt;Once Biden signs the legislation, the Treasury Department will have the sole authority to decide what entities would be considered brokers. A Treasury official &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/treasury-will-not-target-non-brokers-even-without-crypto-tax-amendment.html"&gt;previously told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it wouldn’t target miners and hardware developers, but that promise doesn’t prevent new administrations from going after them in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNvEDt"&gt;Cryptocurrency groups are already preparing to bar the Treasury from changing its mind on miners in the future. Neeraj Agrawal, director of communication for Coin Center, said that the group would “be pursuing legislative fixes to constrain the new language more permanently” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1457726300987273223?s=20"&gt;in a tweet on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear what this remedy could look like as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QE99V1"&gt;Aside from the cryptocurrency reporting rules, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;the infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; includes billions of dollars to improve roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure across the country. The measure includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;$65 billion to connect&lt;/a&gt; every American household to high-speed broadband over the next 10 years. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;$7.5 billion to build&lt;/a&gt; over half a million EV charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6FgRn"&gt;At a Monday White House press conference, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that the “bipartisan infrastructure deal will now become the law of the land” but declined to answer additional questions on when to expect Biden to sign the bill. The White House has yet to announce the timing for a future signing ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAl4m8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUgdlM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Bezos’ latest plan to protect forests could backfire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Day Two of COP26 Climate Change Talks World Leader’s Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFxLVkMwqamO4GIIdfoSJnj_gNI=/53x0:2948x1930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113501/1236293806.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc., speaks during the Action on Forests and Land Use session at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, U.K., on Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Robert Perry/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcS7dk"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $2 billion plan, announced last week, to plant trees and restore landscapes across Africa and the US has already raised red flags for some conservation experts and activists. Last year, after he pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;$10 billion&lt;/a&gt; to fight climate change, activists in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;called him out&lt;/a&gt; for not doing enough to cut down Amazon’s pollution or work with local communities while crafting his environmental plans. This time, he’s facing similar criticisms on a global scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4WmjR"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund &lt;a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/announcements"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest round of funding on November 1 during a high-profile United Nations climate summit taking place in Glasgow. There aren’t many details out yet, but the fund says it will funnel $1 billion towards planting trees and “revitalizing” grasslands in Africa, as well as restoring 20 different landscapes across the US. The other $1 billion will support sustainable agriculture initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9pEfX"&gt;The hope with the new conservation investment is to preserve ecosystems that naturally draw down and store planet-heating carbon dioxide pollution. That builds on a commitment Bezos made in September to spend $1 billion to create and manage so-called “protected” areas for conservation. The Bezos Earth Fund also says it wants local communities and Indigenous peoples “placed at the heart of conservation programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mQxvJU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The worst-case scenario is they do a lot of damage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EscxjA"&gt;But without safeguards in place, the initiative could potentially harm ecosystems and infringe on local and Indigenous peoples’ rights, some experts say. Instead of flinging money into these projects, they’d rather see Bezos cut pollution from the behemoth businesses he’s founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giNOkY"&gt;“Organizations like the Bezos Earth Fund have tended to sort of hire people in Seattle to fix Africa. And that doesn’t work,” says Forrest Fleischman, who teaches natural resources policy at the University of Minnesota. “Sort of the best-case scenario [with inexperienced donors] is that they waste all the money, and the worst-case scenario is they do a lot of damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuvFn4"&gt;There are heated debates flaring up right now around how to conserve and restore ecosystems. That’s, in part, because of a stream of splashy, new projects to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. Last year, for instance, the World Economic Forum launched an initiative to plant a trillion trees. That was met with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from a cadre of forestry and conservation experts, who warned that aggressive tree-planting campaigns have, at times, led to monocrops of a single species of tree. Those tree farms don’t offer the same kinds of ecological benefits as natural forests that are teeming with diverse species. They might even harm ecosystems by putting a lot of trees where they don’t belong, like in savannas and grasslands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2zCoL"&gt;“Many believe that nothing bad can possibly come from planting trees, but planting trees ...in grasslands and savannas does irreversible damage to grasslands and savannas,” Rhodes University ecologist Susanne Vetter wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Environmental groups like the World Resources Institute have mistakenly mapped those ecosystems as degraded forests suitable for tree planting in the past, Vetter wrote in an opinion &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.549483/full"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems in 2020. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBZxQE"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund said that it will work with AFR100, a partnership between 31 governments in Africa that is advised by WRI and aims to restore 100 million hectares of land across the continent by 2030. AFR100 “advocates actively against the conversion of natural ecosystems, like grasslands and savannas, into tree plantations,” a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Each country that’s part of AFR100 ultimately makes decisions based on input from experts and local communities, says Bernadette Arakwiye, a research associate for WRI based in Rwanda. The maps Vetter referenced in her paper have been updated and don’t necessarily inform decisions on which lands to restore, according to Arakwiye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcJsdq"&gt;But splashy climate change commitments like the Bezos Earth Fund can easily fall into pitfalls associated with tree planting because of their focus on speed and scale, says Prakash Kashwan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. “Designing restoration projects that are environmentally good requires working with each individual landscape based on what the landscape is like,” he says. “If our goal is to learn from indigenous engagements with nature, one fundamental principle is to slow down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BfeYMN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a history of “green-grabbing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6BTSLq"&gt;Taking the time to consult with local communities who use the land is also important because projects can also inflame old wounds inflicted upon Indigenous peoples in the name of conservation in the past. There’s a history of &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.2021.1924574?journalCode=venv20"&gt;“green-grabbing” that’s tied to colonization&lt;/a&gt; around the world. Half of “protected” areas around the world occupy lands that were once Indigenous peoples’ homes and territories, according to a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/Conservation.aspx"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples’ Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. After land has been set aside as a protected area, tribes might be pushed off their lands or could be barred from practicing traditions like hunting, even when done sustainably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4vMHt"&gt;There’s also a history of violent policing of protected areas. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), for example, funded park rangers accused of killing, raping, and torturing local and Indigenous people at African national parks and wildlife reserves, a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/wwfsecretwar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found. In 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund awarded WWF &lt;a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/the-bezos-earth-fund-wwf-investment-in-community-and-climate#:~:text=The%20Bezos%20Earth%20Fund%20has,of%20people%20around%20the%20world."&gt;$100 million&lt;/a&gt; to protect and restore more lands.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlAg2D"&gt;Experts &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with have advice for how to avoid repeating the past. “This money should be targeted to wherever, to whatever local communities are already doing and think are the best approaches to [restore landscapes],” says Ida Djenontin, whose research focuses on environmental management and governance at Michigan State University and London School of Economics. Djenontin has also previously collaborated with AFR100. &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/6/3015"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that forests fare better under the care of Indigenous peoples that depend on them for their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6U6hB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Forests fare better under the care of Indigenous peoples&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvYGX"&gt;Kashwan is concerned that even if the Bezos Earth Fund is serious about wanting to center Indigenous peoples in its conservation programs, meaningful engagement could be hampered in developing nations that lack a strong, existing framework of legal protections for tribes. “These initiatives are fundamentally flawed because all they do is to [make] declarations of good intentions,” Kashwan says. There’s no institutional mechanism for accountability across much of the Global South, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXIli5"&gt;Even in the US, there’s still work to be done to make sure environmental philanthropy efforts are mindful of vulnerable populations. The Bezos Earth Fund says that 40 percent of funds earmarked for the US will go towards projects that “directly engage or benefit underserved communities.” That comes after grassroots activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662529/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-150-million-climate-justice-amazon"&gt;pushed Bezos&lt;/a&gt; to invest more in communities of color disproportionately burdened with pollution. Some of those communities are still fighting for Amazon to clean up the air pollution its warehouses saddle their neighborhoods with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ICELp"&gt;Experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that perhaps the biggest impact Bezos could have would be to stop the harm Amazon does to the environment through its pollution. Even after making big pledges to tackle climate change, Amazon’s greenhouse gas emissions have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continued to grow&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. As long as that’s the case, initiatives like Bezos Earth Fund amount to little more than corporate greenwashing, say experts like Fiore Longo, head of the conservation campaign at Survival International, a human rights organization that advocates for tribal peoples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqZrAl"&gt;Wealthy corporate figureheads, she says, “think they can just keep destroying the planet through producing emissions and then creating protected areas or planting trees somewhere and then magically, their emissions will be compensated for. In the key moment that we are in when we need real decisions for the protection of biodiversity and to stop climate change, we can’t allow ourselves this kind of distraction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5r2zF"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund declined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcyOtR"&gt;Peloton has announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/pause-button/"&gt;finally added a pause button&lt;/a&gt; for its on-demand classes for its Bike and Bike Plus devices, allowing users to temporarily pause workouts in the middle of a class and then resume them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kbsBC"&gt;It’s a feature that bewilderingly hasn’t been available until today — and, technically, still isn’t even available on all of Peloton’s products, as the pause button is only rolling out to its cycling bikes for now. The Tread treadmill is set to get a similar update sometime “in the future” — but for now, you’ll have to do your runs all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IHfuG"&gt;While it’s easy to joke at Peloton’s expense for the outsized deal the company is making over adding so small a feature, it is worth noting that adding a pause button to Peloton classes &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; involve a bit more thought behind it than simply just pausing and resuming the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZwaaYn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rolling out today on the Bike and Bike Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bX3zyN"&gt;That’s largely because of Peloton’s popular leaderboard and ranking system, which let customers compare how they’re doing in a particular workout against fellow Peloton users. Adding a pause button could sully the integrity of those metrics, allowing unscrupulous users to pause, catch a quick breather, and then resume the workout at maximum effort to skew their ranking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYA2yi"&gt;Pausing a workout, however, will automatically cause users to lose their rank on the leaderboard (although all the other usual metrics, challenges, achievements, and personal records will still be unchanged). Paused users will still appear on the “Here Now” list in the app and receive high fives from other Peloton users, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKDJlg"&gt;Obviously, the new pause button only works for on-demand Peloton classes and not for live classes — Peloton is a powerful force, but freezing the forward motion of temporal space and reversing the entropic march toward the universe’s inevitable heath death remain beyond its capabilities. At least, for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian will start selling electric vans to non-Amazon companies in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWZr0lgZQcjon48uXkbF9Nckass=/118x0:1558x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113105/fleet_overlay_amazon_alzb8t.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBm5Jo"&gt;Rivian says it will start taking orders for its electric delivery vans in 2022 and will deliver them to fleet customers in “early 2023,” calling into question the status of Amazon’s exclusive rights to the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8PI33"&gt;The buzzy EV startup — which is slated to go public this week at a valuation of $50 billion or higher — quietly announced the details about its fleet sales plans in a &lt;a href="https://rivian.com/fleet"&gt;new section of its website that went live Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. It also said it will sell fleet versions of its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S electric SUV, meaning it will compete with Ford’s commercial version of the F-150 Lightning, as well as a fleet management platform called FleetOS and a charging infrastructure solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPySLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Electric vans, plus fleet versions of the R1T and R1S, will be available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GvjywR"&gt;Selling electric delivery vans to commercial fleet customers other than Amazon could help Rivian make a lot more money in the near term, as the market for these vehicles is still wide open. But the startup runs the risk of biting off more than it can chew. Rivian’s ability to make vehicles at scale is still unproven; it has only just started making and delivering the R1T and is still preparing the delivery van for mass production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WppWmX"&gt;The fleet section of Rivian’s website was launched just one day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764212/rivian-discrimination-lawsuit-toxic-bro-culture-rj-scaringe-ipo"&gt;the company was sued by a former VP&lt;/a&gt; for alleged gender discrimination; among other things, she claimed Rivian had manufacturing quality problems and too-lofty delivery targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwfT29"&gt;Amazon and Rivian announced that they were collaborating on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;an electric delivery van in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The conglomerate said it would order up to 100,000 vans through 2024, part of the effort to decarbonize its logistics fleet. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20percent-stake-in-electric-vehicle-maker-rivian.html"&gt;recently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;owns some 20 percent of Rivian&lt;/a&gt; after participating in multiple funding rounds before the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlooF5"&gt;When Rivian announced its plan to go public earlier this year, it shared &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488ds1a.htm#toc157488_14"&gt;further details about the deal with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488dex1013.htm"&gt;filings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488dex1014.htm"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two companies agreed that Amazon would have exclusive rights to the delivery van for four years after Rivian provided the first batch. Amazon would also have the right of first refusal for two years after that over any other companies that wanted to buy the vans from Rivian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0hFlJ"&gt;As a result, Rivian confessed to prospective investors that a “significant portion” of its “near-term” revenue would come from Amazon. And some were listening. “The exclusivity clause of this agreement may significantly hamper Rivian’s ability to capture market share,” equity research firm New Constructs &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rivian-amazon-deal-could-backfire-ipo-startup-2021-11"&gt;wrote in a report last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="06aEBk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Rivian’s IPO filing reveals Amazon’s prime influence","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EGsFkt"&gt;Neither company would explain the current status of Amazon’s exclusive rights to Rivian’s van, though. The new section of Rivian’s site, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/4000sonnets/status/1456693374971375617"&gt;tweeted by communications director Amy Mast&lt;/a&gt;, says customers will be able to use an “online fleet configurator to plan and place your fleet order” in “early 2022,” and that “[d]eliveries of the [van] are scheduled to begin in early 2023.” Mast declined to comment, citing the SEC’s mandatory quiet period in the run-up to a public offering. Amazon also declined to comment when asked about the status of the exclusivity period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNaZjl"&gt;There are a few provisions in the agreement with Amazon that could void the exclusivity period, though they don’t seem applicable yet. If Amazon doesn’t order 10,000 of Rivian’s vans in each of the two years after they go into production, it would have to reimburse the startup for certain costs and the exclusivity period would be voided. Same goes if Amazon terminates its agreement with Rivian before ordering all 100,000 vans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2pNvh"&gt;Rivian still touts the deal with Amazon on the new fleet page, too. “To meet the demands of the largest retail seller in the United States, Rivian created vehicles and infrastructures to increase safety and efficiency while improving total cost of ownership,” the company writes. “Rivian plans to deliver 100,000 Electric Delivery Vans to Amazon to help Amazon take a significant step toward achieving its ambitious goals for the planet.” The startup confirms it still plans to deliver the first 10 delivery vans to Amazon by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QCCH6"&gt;There could be a semantic explanation for all of this. Rivian and Amazon’s exclusive agreement is in reference to “last mile delivery vehicles,” which the companies obtusely define as “any electric vehicles and other delivery carriers and systems designed or produced for use in a fleet for logistics or last mile transportation of goods to the final delivery destination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvxtoo"&gt;Rivian’s new fleet site, however, refers to the van more broadly as a “commercial vehicle.” So it may be that Rivian is starting to detail efforts to sell vans to companies that aren’t in the delivery business, and that the exclusivity is more about keeping Rivian’s vans away from Amazon’s direct competition. (Though, FedEx has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;working with General Motors’ commercial EV effort&lt;/a&gt;, BrightDrop, and &lt;a href="https://arrival.com/us/en/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles"&gt;UPS invested in Arrival&lt;/a&gt;.) Whatever is happening, it appears that Rivian’s deal with Amazon is not as prohibitive as it initially seemed — and something the company will likely share more about after it goes public this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite halts sale of Travis Scott emote days after concert tragedy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g36-GD7qVlfyJ-1IlKou7hHRdwo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113036/Fortnite_20200423190729.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="710oE4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hdsiymnBBWM"&gt;“Out West” emote&lt;/a&gt;, which features audio of the Travis Scott song “Out West,” has been removed from the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Item Shop. In fact, the entire section of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s &lt;/em&gt;Item Shop that housed the dance emote is gone. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-08-fortnite-pulls-travis-scott-emote-from-daily-shop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the “Daily” section of the Item Shop has disappeared with no explanation, and Epic declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Vq7jj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s known that the "Daily" section of the Item Shop has been disabled. This is intentional and the "Daily" section will return with the next Item Shop refresh. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rc6Kqh7qoW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rc6Kqh7qoW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1457538163262607361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArAmKt"&gt;The emote was apparently on sale to coincide with Scott’s music festival Astroworld, which ended prematurely when &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/07/us/astroworld-travis-scott-deaths.html"&gt;eight people died&lt;/a&gt; after being crushed in what witnesses are calling an overcrowded and unsafe venue. After the incident, Scott was criticized for allegedly continuing the concert as people were being crushed and for not having enough safety protocols in place. Last year, the rapper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;held a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; virtual concert&lt;/a&gt;, and multiple Travis Scott-themed items were created and sold to celebrate the event. It seems the “Out West” emote was the only Travis Scott item affected, and it is not known if Epic Games will disable other Travis Scott emotes or skins or if they will return to the shop in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8A4BM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is already sold out of its electric crate motor but won’t say how many</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpP_szesfMMWYCFFD-u4roJj5Qk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70112866/All_electric_Ford_F_100_Eluminator_concept_truck_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="abbrzs"&gt;Days after Ford started selling its first-ever electric crate motor, it already sold out (via &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/11/ford-eluminator-electric-crate-engine-sold-out-but-more-on-the-way/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ford Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Ford just isn’t saying how many were sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDvEdr"&gt;Ford caught the attention of EV and Ford enthusiasts alike when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759825/ford-electric-crate-motors-mustang-mach-e-gt-performance"&gt;it showcased the Eluminator&lt;/a&gt; in an all-electric 1978 F-100. The $3,900 crate motor is the same one that powers the Mustang Mach-E GT, sporting 480 horsepower with 634 pound-feet of torque. Batteries and other components aren’t included with the motor, although Ford plans on making those parts available individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYcDKr"&gt;“Demand has exceeded expectations,” a Ford spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. At this point, it remains unclear how e-crate motors were sold or if those numbers surpassed the typical sales for Ford’s gasoline-powered crate motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9H7cj"&gt;If you were hoping to get your hands on the Eluminator, whether to throw it in an existing build or to start a custom project, Ford notes that it will be back in stock soon. The Ford spokesperson told us that “interested customers can sign up online to be notified when they are available again to order” by entering an email or phone number on &lt;a href="https://accessories.ford.com/products/eluminator-mach-e-electric-motor"&gt;the Eluminator’s product page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic launches platform to build ‘real-world metaverse’ apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TV1Sgh58QrFvGYQIswo9NKrUXsE=/917x0:2477x1040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70112689/Metaverse_SmallFile.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OVweE3"&gt;Niantic is releasing a platform for building what it calls “real-world metaverse” apps. Called Lightship, the platform is “built around the parts necessary to stitch together the digital and the real world,” CEO John Hanke tells me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Q0cVz"&gt;According to Hanke, Lightship will let mobile apps identify whether a user’s camera is pointed at the sky or water, map the surfaces and depth of an environment in real time, or place a virtual object behind a physical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsUc6e"&gt;Niantic is best known for creating one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761166/pokemon-go-ar-games-future-pikmin-harry-potter"&gt;successful mobile games ever, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;With Lightship, Hanke says the company is “opening the vault of tech that we’ve been using to build our products” to help others build “planet-scale AR apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9s4jZl"&gt;Lightship has been in development &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17511606/niantic-labs-pokemon-go-real-world-platform-ar"&gt;for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;. But starting Monday, it’s open for any developer to access. Most of the software toolkit is free, though Niantic will charge for a feature that can let multiple devices access shared AR experiences simultaneously. The company is also committing $20 million to fund new companies building AR apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BTnM"&gt;Niantic is already planning a major update to Lightship for next year, building what Hanke calls a “visual positioning system” for AR glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPFqae"&gt;By using the new system, glasses with displays in them will be able to understand exactly where they are in the real world, which will let virtual objects (such as a Pikachu) stay anchored persistently to real-world locations. It’s a critical component needed to make AR glasses, such as the kind that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997493/niantic-qualcomm-xr2-ar-glasses"&gt;Niantic is building with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wOmrw5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Niantic wants to “set a pattern for what AR can be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7tcgzB"&gt;Hanke, who previously ran Google Maps before starting Niantic, says the goal with Lightship is to “basically set a pattern for what AR can be.” While tech giants like Meta and Apple are building similar software tools, he thinks Lightship’s support for iOS and Android will make it an attractive offering to developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUhKQj"&gt;“The state of the world today is sort of 50/50 between Android and iOS,” he says. “And I think it’s going to be much more diversified in the world of AR glasses. So a solution that actually solves the developer problem of being able to write something and create something that’s going to work across multiple platforms is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2keq1N"&gt;In August, Hanke wrote a blog post calling the idea of the metaverse a &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/"&gt;“dystopian nightmare.”&lt;/a&gt; He’s against the idea of technology pulling people out of the real world. Unlike the VR metaverse championed by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, he wants Niantic and Lightship developers building AR apps that keep people engaged with the physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCqs3T"&gt;“There’s a fork in the road,” he says. “One path goes in this direction of apps that are not connected to the world around us and not helping us connect with the people who we are around.” The other path Niantic is taking with Lightship, according to Hanke, is “encouraging people to do things together with other folks who are alive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buy two games and get one free at Target or Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Np1DuI6gn9hjF77DrgiplfAsQhs=/0x0:765x510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70112586/games-install.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QUSmms"&gt;Clear off some room on your bookshelf because Target and Amazon are having a “buy two, get one free” sale on video games. This sale is unfortunately restricted to physical copies but includes new titles like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While we’re definitely here for the video games, it’s worth mentioning that this deal includes tons of classic and contemporary board games as well, like &lt;em&gt;Exploding Kittens&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing Monopoly,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sushi Go!&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re looking to fill out your game collection, we’ve linked to the landing pages for both retailers below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuNxjQ"&gt;“Buy two, get one free” video games: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A2NEKY0JEA1965"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

Right now, this amazing headset has been discounted to just $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfXuffH6lfY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to its lowest price ever. This deal is normally only available to My Best Buy members, but it’s available to the public for today only. This incredibly comfy headset supports USB-C charging, and although it lacks a built-in audio mixer to adjust game and chat volume, we were still impressed by the overall sound profile of this particular headset.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, you can save $40 on this robust and customizable peripheral at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-one-wireless-controller-elite-series-2%2F-%2FA-76439797%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeConsoleDeals110821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $140. One of the big caveats in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our initial review&lt;/a&gt; of this controller was the hefty price tag, and while we could certainly justify the investment, this deal just makes the Series 2 that much more appealing. This hefty controller features trigger stops for quick double taps, back paddles for additional inputs, as well swappable thumbsticks for a truly customizable experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="gKqn8N"&gt;Grab a pair of the Beats Solo Pro for just $150 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Solo-Pro-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-On-Ear-Headphones-with-Apple-H1-Headphone-Chip-Black%2F350931600%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG09M22lxjQQA0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG09M22lxjQQA0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeConsoleDeals110821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; today. Originally $300, these noise-canceling headphones are available for their lowest price ever in black, white, or grey colorways. While the lack of a USB-C connection might annoy some Android users, the lightning connection is perfectly suited for anyone that lives in the Apple ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; was impressed by the solid sound quality and effective noise cancellation of these unassuming headphones, and we were pleased with the overall improvement in their design over previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7ybC9f"&gt;Bose is offering massive discounts on refurbished models of some of its top-of-the-line headphones and earbuds, including the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeTechDeals110821/https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-10936017?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Foutlet%2Fqc-earbuds-fr.html%23v%3Dqc_earbuds_fr_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for $180&lt;/a&gt; ($100 off) and the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeTechDeals110821/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones_outlet/noise-cancelling-headphones-700-fr.html?mc=25_AF_MU_AO_00_CJ_&amp;amp;affiliateid=CJ8836602&amp;amp;cjevent=80cb712740b811ec82dc3dcb0a82b832&amp;amp;Publisher=Vox+Media#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_fr_black&amp;amp;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 700  headphones for $250&lt;/a&gt; ($130 off). Even the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836602-10936017?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Foutlet%2Fbose-frames-alto-fr.html%23v%3Dbose_frames_alto_fr_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Alto Frames are down to just $100&lt;/a&gt;, cutting the original price tag in half. While these products are second-hand, a certified refurbished product is one that’s been returned to Bose and thoroughly inspected to meet their standards. These are, by far, some of the best discounts we’ve seen on these products, and we’re unlikely to see a deal this good on new models.
