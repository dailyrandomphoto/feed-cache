    <title>Windows 11 now has its first beta release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHrEtgK_U7nYkMCwd_oG-nwHWQk=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652247/windows11main.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AUYU9i"&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/07/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22000-100/"&gt;released the first beta of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, available to those enrolled in its Windows Insider Program. Until today, getting access to Windows 11 meant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;installing the Dev preview&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/flighting"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; is for “highly technical users” as it has “rough edges.” According to Microsoft, the beta release is less volatile, with builds being validated by Microsoft (though it’s still probably something you’ll want to install on a test machine or second partition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wmi8rk"&gt;Of course, to install the beta you’ll need a compatible computer. Figuring out if your hardware will work with the next version of Windows has been notoriously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;tricky to pin down&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft’s article about &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/"&gt;preparing for Insider builds&lt;/a&gt; directs people to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its system requirements page&lt;/a&gt;. The company has said that it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554245/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-intel-7th-gen-amd-zen-1-pc"&gt;paying close attention&lt;/a&gt; to how well 7th Gen Intel and AMD Zen 1 CPUs work during the testing period, so it’s possible those systems could be allowed to run the beta but not the final release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m_5ws3gSHrNMiuyR2OQFCYDOyNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748969/2021_07_29_11_48_14_Settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching to the Beta Channel is easy, for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DW3SC7"&gt;The beta release is also good news for those of us who installed the Dev preview to get our hands on Windows 11 as soon as possible, but don’t actually need to be on the bleeding (read: buggy) edge. If you, like me, are in this situation, you can switch to the Beta channel by going to Settings &amp;gt; Windows Update &amp;gt; Windows Insider Program, then clicking on Choose your Insider Settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlEvfv"&gt;Usually switching from Dev to Beta &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/flighting"&gt;requires a complete OS re-install&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/windowsinsider/status/1420796240875380737"&gt;according to the Windows Insider Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be possible to do in place for a “short period of time.” It’s probably best to hop on that as soon as you can if you don’t need to stay on the Dev channel. I’ve tested it out myself, and switching to the Beta channel only required a quick reboot — a small price to pay for what will hopefully be smoother sailing until the actual release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0OAYYH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They are still betas&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zNDHAN"&gt;For those who are still running Windows 10, but are adventurous enough to join the beta, you can register for Microsoft’s beta program &lt;a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, while Microsoft says that the Beta Channel releases are more stable than Dev Channel ones, they are still betas. There will likely be bugs, crashes, and missing features — Microsoft even has a whole list of current issues &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/07/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22000-100/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt;, which also says that the Teams Chat feature that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585360/windows-11-preview-chat-microsoft-teams-integration-insiders"&gt;available for some in the Dev channel&lt;/a&gt; isn’t currently available for beta users yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXfqvu"&gt;But if you’ve been itching to try out Windows 11, it’s now in a stable enough place that Microsoft is willing to call it ready for early adopters (for those who live on the verge, one could say).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GarageBand can now help you remix tracks from Lady Gaga and Dua Lipa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIVKZEteEhIaDqboikgwu4SwBNM=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652208/apple_garageband_update_jul21_hero_07292021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDUWki"&gt;If a year inside convinced you to shoot your shot at becoming an international DJ, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/garageband-features-new-sound-packs-from-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-and-top-producers/"&gt;Apple is updating GarageBand for iOS and iPadOS on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; with a low-stakes way to start dabbling in the world of remixes. GarageBand’s Remix Sessions lets you try your hand at remixing tracks from Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga with short video tutorials available to watch while you mess with loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11Yslx"&gt;You can access the new Remix Sessions from the Sound Library section of GarageBand. There’s currently only one song for each artist, “Break My Heart” for Dua Lipa and “Free Woman” for Lady Gaga, but the amount of samples and loops each song comes with is surprisingly broad. If you’ve played with GarageBand’s Live Loops before, the experience should be self-explanatory. Apple’s implementation of its video tutorial is a bit clunky — the downloaded artist’s Live Loops project will show up in your GarageBand, but to watch while you edit your song, you have to start the video in the Sound Library page and pop it into picture-in-picture mode manually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyeX-lAvjsQQLIegK_7GcCrLucQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748868/apple_garageband_update_jul21_remix_lady_gaga_07292021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can watch video tutorials with tips from Lady Gaga or Dua Lipa while you remix their songs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L1sBBm"&gt;Apple is also releasing “hundreds of royalty-free loops, beats, instruments, drum kits, synth patches, and samples” in downloadable Producer Packs that, like the Remix Sessions, include video content that Apple says offers insight into the producers’ creative process. If a companion Mark Ronson Live Loops project that ties in to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/06/apple-tv-unveils-trailer-for-new-docuseries-watch-the-sound-with-mark-ronson/"&gt;an upcoming Apple TV Plus show&lt;/a&gt; is of interest to you, that’s available, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqNt3S"&gt;Interestingly, these new GarageBand perks are currently only available on iOS and iPadOS: users of the original macOS desktop version will have to go without Lady Gaga’s encouragement. The macOS version of GarageBand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490656/apple-garageband-new-update-1000-new-loops-artist-lessons-free"&gt;does include “Artist Lessons” for free&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ph24954?locale=en_US"&gt;more hands-on educational videos&lt;/a&gt; for specific instruments like guitar or piano, so there’s at least something for you there if you’re trying to start your music journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zYqGD"&gt;GarageBand’s Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available to download now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney over Black Widow’s streaming release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrPKSWUyr_2FYR2EOOkLe2KCz7g=/290x0:1310x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69651944/cc34ecb078c29957ad70d987b6b38121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RpTUm4"&gt;Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney over the simultaneous streaming release of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted the same day in theaters and on Disney Plus through its Premier Access service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Si0VK"&gt;The suit was filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court and alleges that Johansson’s contract with Marvel Entertainment, which is owned by Disney, ensured a “wide theatrical release” of the film. The suit says it’s “well understood” that the agreement meant an exclusive release that would not include streaming. Johansson’s salary was in part based on the box office performance of the film, the suit says, meaning the streaming offer could meaningfully cut into her paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22KALl"&gt;“Disney knew that the cannibalization of [box office receipts] by Disney+ would save Marvel (and by extension, Disney) ‘very large’ amounts of money that it would otherwise owe Ms. Johansson,” the lawsuit states. “On information and belief, Disney intentionally induced Marvel’s breach of the Agreement, without justification, in order to prevent Ms. Johansson from realizing the full benefit of her bargain with Marvel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WozDos"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cannibalization of [box office receipts] by Disney+ would save Marvel (and by extension, Disney) ‘very large’ amounts of money”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ab1XjN"&gt;Johansson could lose $50 million because of the altered release plans, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-over-black-widow-streaming-release-11627579278?st=b43fty44c1jljjq&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Disney did not immediately return a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk1Uig"&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Disney had two primary motivations for the hybrid release. First, it argues, Disney wanted to boost subscriber numbers for its streaming service and inflate its stock value. Second, the suit states, “Disney wanted to substantially devalue Ms. Johansson’s agreement and thereby enrich itself.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFxvZy"&gt;The lawsuit’s argument — that Disney promised an exclusive theatrical release before reneging on that assurance — seems to hinge on what constitutes a “theatrical release.” The suit states that both Marvel and Johansson understood the contractual promise of a wide theatrical debut to mean the film “would initially be released exclusively in movie theatres, and that it would remain exclusively in movie theatres for a period of between approximately 90 and 120 days.” But it’s not stated whether those details are present in her contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzs4qx"&gt;“As Ms. Johansson, Disney, Marvel, and most everyone else in Hollywood knows, a ‘theatrical release’ is a release that is exclusive to movie theatres,” the suit states. “Disney was well aware of this promise, but nonetheless directed Marvel to violate its pledge and instead release the Picture on the Disney+ streaming service the very same day it was released in movie theatres.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yk5G3i"&gt;Disney does seem to have understood that changing the release strategy would impact Johansson. Marvel’s chief counsel, David Galluzzi, wrote to Johansson’s representatives in 2019, indicating there would be a discussion if the release plan shifted, according to the lawsuit. “We understand that should the plan change, we would need to discuss this with you and come to an understanding as the deal is based on a series of (very large) box office bonuses,” Galluzzi is quoted as writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mrpXCj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A ‘theatrical release’ is a release that is exclusive to movie theatres”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6oXLJi"&gt;Over the course of the pandemic, several of Disney’s titles originally intended for exclusive theatrical releases instead debuted simultaneously in theaters and on Disney Plus through its Premier Access platform. Premier Access charges an additional fee of $30 to stream these films from home on Disney Plus at the same time they’re playing in theaters. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and the live-action remake of &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; are among a handful of films that have released this way as theaters buckled under pandemic lockdowns and COVID-19 restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aegpp9"&gt;It’s a significant development in the release structure that has emerged during the pandemic. Many major streamers have opted to release films this way, including HBO Max. The model has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;come under fire&lt;/a&gt; from major Hollywood directors like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; director Denis Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiBTrI"&gt;The lawsuit filed this week alleges that following Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that the picture would debut as a day-and-date title, Johansson and her team attempted to negotiate with Marvel about the film’s release. It alleges that Marvel “ignored this outreach,” and the film &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;debuted on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; under the hybrid release model anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rOsmf2"&gt;

    <title>Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6wqOigeWXYwlkB318-eVG-AgLc=/0x102:2000x1435/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69651710/Edge_family_2021_sm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Motorola Edge 20 Pro, Edge 20, and Edge 20 Lite all support 5G and come with a 6.7-inch OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYOUQf"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229740/motorola-edge-plus-android-phone-display-features-camera-specs-hands-on"&gt;keeping its return to flagship devices running&lt;/a&gt; for the second year in a row with today’s global announcement of the Edge 20 Pro, Edge 20, and Edge 20 Lite. The top-end 20 Pro includes a periscope-style telephoto lens for the first time in a Motorola device and includes a Snapdragon 870 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8G23N3"&gt;All three devices support sub-6GHz 5G, offer 108-megapixel rear-facing cameras, and include 6.7-inch OLED screens with fast refresh rates. They’re due to arrive in August in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. While Motorola doesn’t offer specifics, it says that it plans to bring a 5G Edge device to North America this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8gGM8Ni6wMaaQ40TnvV0kCJ6QE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748778/Motorola_edge_20_pro_Indigo_Vegan_Leather_combo_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 Pro comes in a handsome indigo vegan leather option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xxwhnE"&gt;Priced at €699 (about $830), Edge 20 Pro comes with many features common to the premium midrange class, including a Gorilla Glass 5 front panel, a 144Hz screen refresh rate, and 12GB of RAM with its capable 800-series chipset. Its main rear camera uses a 108-megapixel 1/1.52-inch sensor and f/1.9 aperture, specs that line up with last year’s Edge Plus camera. There’s also a new 8-megapixel 5x telephoto periscope-style camera with optical image stabilization. A 16-megapixel ultrawide does double duty as a macro camera, along with a 32-megapixel selfie camera around front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62mzj2"&gt;A couple of specs don’t quite measure up to the flagship class, though, which was something we noted about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;“great but not quite good enough” Edge Plus predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. For starters, Motorola is &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-edge-20-updates-1658433/"&gt;only committing to one OS upgrade for the device&lt;/a&gt;, which ships with Android 11. The 4,500mAh battery can be charged via fast 30W wired charging but there’s no support for wireless charging. And its IP52 rating means it’s protected against splashes of water, but isn’t guaranteed to survive full submersion like the IP68-rated Samsung Galaxy S21. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6vMmqTCTBBdwoes7UPsds_xjcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748783/Motorola_edge_20_Frosted_Onyx_hero_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 offers a 3x telephoto lens rather than the 5x periscope zoom on the 20 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M2tWAB"&gt;The €499 (about $590) Edge 20 gets the same 6.7-inch OLED with 144Hz refresh rate (though just Gorilla Glass 3 on the front), but includes a stepped-down Snapdragon 778 processor. Rather than the periscope zoom, it offers a stabilized 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera, but its main and ultrawide cameras match those on the 20 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkhdvJprhyVHhDEIFM43iXokRS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748786/Motorola_edge_20_lite_Cyber_Teal_hero_sm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Edge 20 Lite packs a bigger 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JazrSK"&gt;The budget-friendliest Edge 20 Lite, priced at €349 (about $415), uses a MediaTek Dimensity 5G-B chipset, includes a 6.7-inch OLED with a slower-but-still-fast 90Hz refresh rate, skips the telephoto camera altogether, and includes a bigger 5,000mAh battery. It maintains the IP52 rating of the other two devices and still includes 30W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvb9ut"&gt;We liked last year’s Edge phones, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;the more attractively priced midrange Edge&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of that was thanks to some strong camera capabilities. It’s promising to see Motorola leaning into that strength with a new telephoto lens, though the highest tier device still appears to lack a couple of key specs to compete well in its class. Maybe the midrange will be Motorola’s sweet spot again this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s not just you, streaming the Olympics is a mess </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gymnastics - Artistic - Olympics: Day 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUglwqnu0_F9TlIMozCRvDQPXWQ=/73x0:4105x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69651441/1331298171.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X717dg"&gt;Figuring out how to watch the Olympics this year has been frustrating. NBC holds broadcasting rights to the Games in the US, so it naturally seized on the opportunity to boost subscribers to its streaming service, Peacock, by making it “the place to flock for the Games’ top moments.” Streaming the Olympics should’ve been as easy as signing up — except it wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nx367P"&gt;Peacock’s coverage was a problem straight out of the gate. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589095/olympics-opening-ceremony-watch-start-time-how-to-live-stream"&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t streamed live on the service at all (though the closing ceremony will be), even though it was streamed live on the NBC Olympics website. The service is paywalling men’s basketball, seemingly to boost Peacock’s paid plans. And while live broadcasts and on-demand coverage of most other games and events are available for free on Peacock, finding out what’s on and where to watch it has been a chore, comparable to flicking through a cable TV guide. (Disclosure: NBCUniversal is an investor in Vox Media, parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4MaEw"&gt;Watching on Peacock also means missing out on one of NBC’s biggest promises for the 2020 Games: 4K coverage. Peacock doesn’t support 4K, even while 4K feeds from the games are available on other streaming services. (A spokesperson for Peacock told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that delivering 4K content is on its roadmap.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nVTJZa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peacock didn’t live stream the opening ceremony, which made finding it more of a chore.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ILl45f"&gt;That means you had to turn to TV or a live TV service if you wanted to watch in 4K. But 4K coverage has its own set of problems. Availability has been inconsistent in the US — it depends on where you are, what service you’re subscribed to, and what programming you’re watching. YouTube TV and Comcast, for example, offer 4K Olympics coverage in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/4k"&gt;dozens of major cities&lt;/a&gt;, but other services like FuboTV and Verizon Fios only offer it in a few. If you’re outside those regions, tough luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrBboS"&gt;NBC is also only providing 4K coverage of certain games at certain times. Live NBC coverage is streamed in 4K sometimes, in some places, while other markets will only get 4K re-airings the following day. This can lead to some real confusion if you’re paying extra for 4K features on a service like YouTube, with its recently introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550583/youtube-tv-4k-plus-offline-downloads-now-available-price"&gt;4K Plus add-on&lt;/a&gt;. While all 4K Plus subscribers can see live events on the Olympic Channel and the Golf Channel, as well as next-day re-airings of primetime NBC coverage, 4K primetime coverage from NBC is limited to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/4k"&gt;around 50 markets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4pIWa"&gt;Basically, some folks are getting live NBC primetime coverage in 4K while others are not. A spokesperson for YouTube TV said it took all the 4K coverage that NBC made available to the service. NBCUniversal did not respond to multiple requests for comment about why 4K support was available in select markets and not others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seKs4t"&gt;Despite NBC’s big hurrah about &lt;a href="https://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2021/06/10/nbcuniversal-to-provide-live-4k-hdr-coverage-of-nbcs-tokyo-olympics-primetime-show-for-first-time/"&gt;broadcasting the Olympics in 4K&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unclear whether the 4K footage carried by NBC is really even in 4K. Speaking with NBC executive David Mazza, &lt;a href="https://www.ibc.org/trends/tokyo-olympics-2020-bbc-and-nbc-reveal-remote-production-plans/7727.article"&gt;IBC reported&lt;/a&gt; that NBC was upconverting some 1080p feeds to 4K. NBC would not confirm whether the feeds are 4K or upscaled 1080p when asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wJYti3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Figuring out where to get 4K — or whether it was even supported — was its own headache&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gvv9XW"&gt;Beyond the technical limitations, there’s also been some confusion around finding where to watch different Olympic games. Live programming has been spread across a bunch of different channels due to the scope of the Games — USA Network, CNBC, NBCSN, Olympic Channel, Golf Channel, and Telemundo are all carrying coverage — so much so that NBC Olympics has regularly &lt;a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/tokyo-olympics-july-29-what-to-watch-tv-live-stream"&gt;published guides&lt;/a&gt; to help find what’s on. Peacock’s digital-first platform could have been a huge help in sorting through the mess, but NBC just translated the experience of channel flipping to its app, offering little advantage to cord-cutters. If you do want to watch any of the Games live, you may have to do some additional legwork to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpXc5q"&gt;A spokesperson for Peacock said that the service is currently experimenting and will use what it’s learning to inform its coverage for the Beijing Olympics in 2022. The spokesperson also said there wasn’t a specific reason the closing ceremony would be livestreamed on Peacock while the opening ceremony was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZBlIN"&gt;For many users, the Olympics was likely the first time they had a reason to subscribe to Peacock, which offers both a free and ad-supported tier as well as two paid tiers (one with limited ads and one that’s ad-free). And the tie-in with the 2020 Tokyo Games seems to be working. According to recent data from app analytics company App Annie, mobile downloads of Peacock surged 60 percent in the first few days of the Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lj4CFu"&gt;But in practice, actually streaming the Olympics — and specifically the ability to access some events in real time and at higher resolutions — has been a mess. Offering the Games on Peacock was NBCUniversal’s high-stakes Hail Mary for boosting its subscribers, and hopefully, getting users to stick around post-event. But somewhere along the way, something got lost in the shuffle. And what we ended up with instead is a complicated system that made streaming an even bigger headache than it already is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NBA and iHeartMedia are planning to make a whole lot of podcasts together</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2021 NBA Finals - Game Six" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OK6CXl3vokNlP24PsNsSd9LnCw=/0x0:3360x2240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69651158/1329804201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m26yRC"&gt;The NBA and iHeartMedia, which owns iHeartRadio, will be launching more than 20 new co-produced podcasts as part of a multiyear partnership, the two companies announced. The first show is scheduled to debut in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7l4WFg"&gt;“The new shows will be produced using a wide variety of content from the NBA archives to tell the backstories of some of the greatest moments in sports history, along with a mix of the latest league news, player commentary, insider analysis, and much more,” &lt;a href="https://www.iheartmedia.com/press/iheartmedia-and-nba-team-multi-year-podcast-partnership-present-groundbreaking-slate-nba"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAtwV6"&gt;The lineup could include daily shows as well as limited series, and it may pull from the NBA’s archives of content, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-28/nba-plans-daily-weekly-podcasts-in-new-deal-with-iheart-media"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve been looking for the right partner to help bring our archives to life,” David Denenberg, the NBA’s SVP of national and local network partnerships, said to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “We have tons of audio footage that’s never seen the light of day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAJDmY"&gt;More details will be revealed “at a later date,” the companies said in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsFKJQ"&gt;The partnership between the two companies marks another push from a big sports organization into sports podcasts. ESPN and Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243927/netflix-espn-spotify-the-last-dance-michael-jordan-documentary-podcast"&gt;teamed up with Spotify last year&lt;/a&gt; on podcasts for &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/em&gt;, the docuseries about Michael Jordan. And it’s not just traditional sports that are getting the podcast treatment — Spotify and Riot Games, developer of the hugely popular game &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, announced a multiyear partnership &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21395974/spotify-riot-games-league-of-legends-podcast-music"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kindle Voyage lead" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nw07IijdrSQNdsP0gyLXOYpefMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69647917/kindle-voyage-review-001-2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2BxS2"&gt;Amazon’s Kindle e-readers with built-in 3G &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G7H6AASHTERXBKNV&amp;amp;ref_=pe_45724480_593852510"&gt;will begin to lose the ability to connect to the internet on their own&lt;/a&gt; in the US in December, according to an email sent to customers on Wednesday. The change is due to mobile carriers transitioning from older 2G and 3G networking technology to newer 4G and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G networks&lt;/a&gt;. For older Kindles without Wi-Fi, this change could mean not connecting to the internet at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1nkEY"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/kindle-3g-e-readers-will-stop-working-in-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good e-Reader&lt;/em&gt; first noted in June&lt;/a&gt;, newer Kindle devices with 4G support should be fine, but for older devices that shipped with support for 3G and Wi-Fi like the Kindle Keyboard (3rd generation), Kindle Touch (4th generation), Kindle Paperwhite (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th generation), Kindle Voyage (7th generation), and Kindle Oasis (8th generation), users will be stuck with Wi-Fi only. In its email announcement, Amazon stresses that you can still enjoy the content you already own and have downloaded on these devices, you just won’t be able to download new books from the Kindle Store unless you’re doing it over Wi-Fi. You can see Amazon’s email to customers below: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3bmzHdlpC3VAh5_SW3KIdh4IPJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746690/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_1.27.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s email announcing the end of internet connectivity on older Kindles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="loRGyk"&gt;Things get more complicated for Amazon’s older Kindles, like the Kindle (1st and 2nd generation), and the Kindle DX (2nd generation). Since those devices relied solely on 2G or 3G internet connectivity, once the networks are shut down, the only way to get new content onto your device will be through an old-fashioned micro-USB cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eN4iOa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The issue is out of Amazon’s hands&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T3qff1"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon says it has a few different options for active customers with impacted devices. Any device is eligible for trade-in on Amazon’s site, but the company is also extending the following credits and offers (check your email for a promo code):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQe3wQ"&gt;For customers with Kindle (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Generation), Amazon is offering a free Kindle Oasis (10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Generation) device and cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeuoZ4"&gt;Customers with Kindle (1st and 2nd Generation), Kindle DX (2nd Generation), and Kindle Keyboard (3rd Generation) can receive $70 off a new Kindle Paperwhite or Kindle Oasis, plus $25 in ebook credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4TLv9"&gt; Customers with Kindle Touch (4th Generation), Kindle Paperwhite (5th Generation, 6th Generation, and 7th Generation), Kindle Voyage (7th Generation), and Kindle Oasis (8th Generation) can receive $50 off a new Kindle Paperwhite or Kindle Oasis, plus $15 in ebook credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NzCO3j"&gt;While in an ideal world, Amazon would replace every device left without internet connectivity, this issue is largely out of Amazon’s hands. The carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457255/verizon-att-3g-shutdown-date"&gt;have all committed to different time frames&lt;/a&gt; for when older 2G and 3G networks will go kaput, with AT&amp;amp;T setting the date for February 22nd, 2022, T-Mobile reportedly targeting April 2022, and Verizon shooting for December 31st, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV1beS"&gt;Taking those into account, Amazon’s December date seems premature, but better to be prepared now, than left with a less useful e-reader later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTt5gw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July, 29th 12:37PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional Amazon offers for customers with impacted Kindles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fire TV Cube can now do Zoom video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5sr-e7qCjc8oKEnOIrfCkE5Nrws=/0x6:1760x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69650701/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_11.24.58_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXWYBV"&gt;Amazon has announced that its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-fire-tv-cube-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B07KGVB6D6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Fire TV Cube&lt;/a&gt; is now able to participate in two-way Zoom video calls. The company rolled out support for videoconferencing between the Fire TV Cube and Alexa smart displays late last year, but Zoom opens up even more possibilities for hosting virtual chats or work calls on the biggest screen in your home. This really would’ve come in handy over the last year, but better late than never, I guess — and it should still prove convenient for anyone working a hybrid office / home schedule in the months ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxyR0k"&gt;The Zoom app for Fire TV is required to get started. So is a webcam, obviously, and the company has some minimum requirements to meet on that front:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OCDL5E"&gt;You will need to connect a webcam that supports USB Video Class (UVC) with at least 720p resolution and 30fps to your Fire TV Cube using a Micro USB to USB adapter. For a better experience, we recommend webcams with 1080p resolution and a 60 to 90-degree field of view from 6 to 10 feet away from the TV. We do not recommend 4K webcams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8oZaVF"&gt;Once you’re up and running, Amazon says you can join meetings with an “Alexa, join my Zoom meeting” voice command. Alexa will then ask for the meeting ID and passcode, which you can input either with your voice or the remote. If you sign into the Zoom app, you should see your upcoming meetings and be able to join them more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C97aTK"&gt;The full details on Zoom calls on the Fire TV Cube can be found &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/two-way-video-calling-with-zoom-now-available-on-fire-tv-cube-2nd-gen-7ba70699386a"&gt;at Amazon’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the feature is currently only available for the second-generation Fire TV Cube and not the original model released in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus’ Hawkeye show gets a November 24th release date</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zE5AZ0"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; spinoff show is officially debuting on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1121161/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on November 24th, the company announced today. The announcement comes with the first official image from the show, that sees Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton iteration of the archer superhero alongside the newly introduced Kate Bishop version of the character, played by Hailee Steinfeld in the upcoming show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zzcngW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;joins &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Solider&lt;/em&gt;, and the recently concluded &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; as the next live-action continuation of Marvel’s sprawling superhero franchise. The show will also pick up on plot threads from &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567297/black-widows-post-credit-scene-explained-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;as teased in the movie’s post-credit sequence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The animated &lt;em&gt;What If...?, &lt;/em&gt;featuring alternative takes on the existing Marvel movie heroes and stories, will arrive on Disney Plus on August 11th and run for 10 weeks through October 13th. Marvel Studios has also yet to announce a release date for &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, which will introduce the popular teenage superhero Kamala Khan to the MCU at some point in “late 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EE6HT"&gt;That’s in addition to Marvel’s theatrical releases for the rest of the year, including &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; on September 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; on November 5th, and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; on December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric boat startup Arc wants to make a big splash </title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Arc&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DLPxtz"&gt;Electricity and water don’t mix — well, actually, they mix &lt;em&gt;really well&lt;/em&gt;, which can be problematic for humans. So the thought of an electric boat may seem risky. A new California startup called Arc is going to try to shred that perception, starting with a limited edition 24-foot watersports boat that will cost around $300,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnwhib"&gt;That’s an incredible amount of money. But Arc — which is &lt;a href="https://arcboats.com/"&gt;coming out of stealth mode today&lt;/a&gt;, boasts a handful of SpaceX expats, and is backed by Silicon Valley powerhouse firm Andreessen Horowitz — plans to work its way down from that price point once it’s producing and selling boats, just like Tesla once did for electric passenger cars with the Roadster, followed by the Model S and X, and then the Model 3 and Y. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NV7Mnp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are using [Tesla’s] playbook almost verbatim.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VLnfxJ"&gt;Electric boats have far fewer moving parts, meaning that they &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;deal a big blow to maintenance costs, one of the biggest headaches of owning a boat. What’s more, electricity can be much cheaper than marina fuel prices, and trickle charging a boat at home makes far more sense than doing it with a car. While Arc’s first boat may not reach total parity with a gas-powered boat, that’s the goal, and Arc CEO Mitch Lee thinks it’s readily attainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoVXuS"&gt;“We are starting up-market, we are working our way down as quickly as we can — we are using their playbook almost verbatim,” Lee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview.  In other words, the limited sales of the $300,000 Arc One boat will help finance the R&amp;amp;D required to make a more affordable version of that Arc, one that could sell “in the thousands,” Lee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkuQ9K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10675353"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPF3S9"&gt;Running Tesla’s playbook while also trying to disrupt the boating world with electric propulsion technology makes it easy to collar Arc with the “Tesla for boats” moniker. Arc wouldn’t be the first, and it won’t be the last, but Lee says he’d rather leave that decision up to the media and the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01e3IK"&gt;“From a branding person, why I hesitate is everyone is going to call themselves the ‘Tesla for boats.’ It’s like, everyone aspires to that,” he says. “What matters is how well are you executing against that playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9e13S"&gt;Arc’s first boat is simple, but something of a marvel — at least on paper. (Lee says Arc has one prototype already.) The boat will have a 200kWh, 800-volt battery pack — roughly double the capacity and voltage of Tesla’s current top-tier pack — and an electric motor with at least 475 horsepower, Lee says. It will have a top speed of around 40 miles per hour and run for a total of around four hours, which Lee says should cover a day’s worth of boating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Upl7Fr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 200kWh, 800-volt battery pack, and 475 horsepower on tap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lIBDeW"&gt;Better yet, Lee says, the boat will throw a wake behind it, meaning it will be fun to use for wake sports like waterskiing. This is rare in the nascent electric boat market, Lee says, because it takes a lot of energy to move through water, so other companies have looked to reduce the forces that create a wake. Some are using a hydrofoil to reduce drag, basically eliminating the wake altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15JtsF"&gt;This is a big reason why the battery pack will be so energy-dense. “When you’re moving through water, power draw is cubic to your speed,” Lee says. “If you want a boat that can go 40 miles an hour, you need a very large battery to be able to handle that.” All that extra energy on tap will help the boat “plane” at higher speeds, too, which is when it essentially skims across the water, reducing drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax1QUx"&gt;“Boats are actually really good at floating — that sounds silly but like it’s not hard to make a boat that could carry a huge load,” Lee says. “The hard part is if you want to plane, or you want to move quickly. [That creates] this exponential power draw, because you’re moving through something much more viscous than air.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iNslx"&gt;Another key part of Arc’s design is that it’s building aluminum hulls. Much like when Ford adopted aluminum for its pickup trucks half a decade ago, Arc is bucking convention here. Most boat hulls in this class are made out of carbon fiber or some other type of composite material. Lee says aluminum will be less labor intensive, less expensive, while still being light enough that Arc can commit most of the weight to the battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrLk46"&gt;While the pack will be big, it will be spread across the bottom of the boat and integrated into the structure of the hull — something that will inevitably draw more comparisons to Tesla, which is working on structural battery packs for its future vehicles. Also like Tesla, Lee says Arc is going for a high degree of vertical integration. In addition to the hull, the startup is designing its own enclosures for the battery packs, as well as the cooling system. It’s developing the software, too, which it plans to tweak and improve via over-the-air updates. Arc &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; sourcing the modules and cells that make up the pack, and the electric motor (Lee declined to name the suppliers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r93MIR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arc is bucking a lot of conventions and promising a simpler ownership experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="29PsqC"&gt;Arc is also pulling in some outside consultants to help with the 800-volt technology since that’s something that is still rare even in the world of high-performance electric vehicles. (Porsche has an 800-volt pack in the Taycan, and GM is working on 800-volt battery packs for its Ultium-powered EVs.) Again, Lee cautions, that doesn’t mean there’s reason to be worried. There’s precedence for high-voltage electrical systems on boats, though they often power the so-called “hotel loads” — basically all the creature comforts not related to propulsion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOlwCn"&gt;“We are novel in that this is going to be our powertrain — we’re using these high voltage batteries for this particular usage,” he says. “Our entire team is dedicated to making sure that we are doing this intelligently and safely. So there are some extra closeouts that we’re doing and the testing process we’re using is ridiculously rigorous, to make sure that we’re bringing this system online safely.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byn1du"&gt;Ultimately, Lee believes the massive theoretical upside of an electric boat will transcend any wariness about what’s powering it. He’s so bullish on the idea that he says he hopes to one day get Arc’s boats to require &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; maintenance. (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1419571113076695040"&gt;Sound familiar&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7y7fT"&gt;“Boating is amazing. Boat ownership is awful, and we want to solve all the awful parts about boat ownership, and expand the boating market,” he says. “If we make a boat that, yes, is premium to the market, but it lowers the headache of boat ownership and amplifies the magic of being out on the water... I think that’s a big selling point for us. And if you kind of pair that with all the macro trends of everything going electric, all of that I think sets us up for the right product, the right market fit, the right time.” &lt;/p&gt;
