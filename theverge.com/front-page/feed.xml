    <title>Razer no longer claims its Zephyr mask uses ‘N95-grade’ filters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WqlEz_78Ahnyto7EfInPQcLAPs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371033/zephyrprofronthero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BafJTT"&gt;Razer’s popular $100 Zephyr mask isn’t a replacement for PPE (because it &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;PPE), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22855795/razer-zephyr-pro-mask-voice-amp-feature-price-ces-2022"&gt;its announcement of the Zephyr Pro last week&lt;/a&gt; spurred a surge of claims that the company had overstated the masks’ protection. Razer responded by scrubbing every instance of “N95-grade” from the mask’s product page late last week (via &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/razer-plays-a-dangerous-game-with-its-misleading-mask-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aurXji"&gt;Previously, Razer used N95 in multiple places to describe the filtration and efficacy of its replaceable filters, which were referred to as “N95-grade” because of their 99 percent bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE). Razer now refers to them as “air purification filters.” While Razer claims that testing showed its filters meet a 95 percent particulate filtration efficiency (PFE), the entire mask (not just the filters) would have to block 95 percent of small particles and be cleared by regulators to call itself an N95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa1NVT"&gt;Razer declined to provide an on-the-record statement in response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But in a tweet thread on Saturday, the company tweeted that “The Razer Zephyr and Zephyr Pro are not medical devices, respirators, surgical masks, or personal protective equipment (PPE) and are not meant to be used in medical or clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7NNSw0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*The Razer Zephyr and Zephyr Pro are not medical devices, respirators, surgical masks, or personal protective equipment (PPE) and are not meant to be used in medical or clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;— R Λ Z Ξ R (@Razer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1479845819511496704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x9JRKP"&gt;This isn’t the first bit of controversial info that Razer has changed on the Zephyr’s page. On December 10th, 2021 (via &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210223814/https://www.razer.com/gear-accessories/razer-zephyr"&gt;Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;), it published a new version of the page that removed its claim in the FAQ section that likened the Zephyr to a medical device, respirator, surgical mask, and PPE, which initially said the Zephyr “offers the same functionality and adequate protection due to its 99% BFE rating.” It now says “Razer Zephyr is not a medical device, respirator, surgical mask or personal protective equipment (PPE) and is not meant to be used on medical or clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46fAcX"&gt;On Saturday, January 8th, &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-zephyr-science&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer published a blog&lt;/a&gt; to its site called “The Science Behind Razer Zephyr” that provides the results of every test that the company put the Zephyr through (relevant or not to the topic of filtration) before coming to market. It issued an update (without any mention of what changed) to this post today, January 10th, that incorporated bits from the statement above, including explicitly stating that the Zephyr and Zephyr Pro are “not certified N95 masks,” along with removing every mention of “N95” that was found in the original blog post published Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVZVCCv2KuHAbJGZEwqOaDxw6kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942600/zephyrfilter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer refers to these filters as “air purification filters” instead of being “N95-grade.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4LZ4t2"&gt;The takeaway from the test results that the blog discloses is that, while Razer did put the Zephyr through several internal tests, it still needs external review from expert agencies before people can feel confident that it’s gone through a rigorous evaluation. That extends to the Zephyr Pro, a version of the mask that adds voice amplification that’s set to come out sometime in 2022, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNipTp"&gt;When the Zephyr was initially announced at CES 2021 as Project Hazel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;we noted&lt;/a&gt; that it lacked “any of the necessary approvals and certifications from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1mlMw"&gt;When Razer launched Zephyr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22726468/razer-zephyr-face-mask-available-features-design-safety"&gt;in late October 2021&lt;/a&gt;, it still hadn’t gotten sufficient testing to be considered PPE, and we noticed that the company referred to it as an “air purifier” in its marketing (while still touting N95-grade filters). Shortly afterward, my colleague Nicole Wetsman and I interviewed Razer’s Jeff Sandoval at our On The Verge event, and Nicole pressed him on the Zephyr’s lack of clearances from agencies like the FDA and NIOSH (at the 9:04 mark).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wrZNHQuybPnb7flbGQn29kCJWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70371019/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4MqeMB"&gt;App Store developers have earned more than $260 billion since the store launched in 2008, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-services-enrich-peoples-lives-throughout-the-year/"&gt;according to a Monday press release from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/"&gt;last January&lt;/a&gt; that developers had earned more than $200 billion since the launch of the App Store, so the new figure shared Monday indicates developers earned $60 billion in 2021. The iPhone maker also said that spending on the App Store between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve in 2021 grew by a double-digit amount, though it didn’t specify exactly what that number might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzhint"&gt;While the new numbers suggest that the App Store continues to be a big moneymaker, developer unhappiness with the store is high at the current moment. Many developers have taken issue with what they see as restrictive store policies, particularly the 30 percent cut Apple takes from many transactions. Apple is still embroiled in a legal dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games over the App Store, and although Apple arguably got off well from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ruling&lt;/a&gt;, that ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Apple won’t have to let developers point customers to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="758qDc"&gt;Monday’s press release also revealed that there are more than 745 million paid subscriptions to Apple services. In recent years, Apple has added new premium services like News Plus, Fitness Plus, and Apple TV Plus to its roster of services offerings. The strategy seems to be paying off, given the number of subscriptions reported Monday and the new all-time high for services revenue reported during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;latest earnings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple quietly discontinues the Beats Pill Plus, its last battery-powered speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuIZuyAmqkYZ9OSgp0aZ8TD96Ds=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370987/beats-pill-plus-0797.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPdmTY"&gt;Apple appears to have quietly discontinued the Beats Pill Plus, with the portable wireless speaker no longer appearing on either Apple or Beats’ websites, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/apple-discontinues-beats-pill-plus/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPABjh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"&gt;Originally released in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the Pill Plus was the first speaker released under the Beats brand since the music company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5700530/apple-confirms-beats-acquisition"&gt;purchased by Apple for $3 billion back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. A more refined version of the original Beats Pill speaker, the Pill Plus was an Apple-ified version of the original product, with sleeker monochromatic color options and the addition of a Lightning port for charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oXUrI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats’ Pill+ is its best speaker ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467123/beats-pill-plus-speaker-apple-dre"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ccL1KU"&gt;Apple and Beats would continue to go on to build out Beats’ lineup of headphones over the intervening half-decade, with products like recent Beats Fit Pro or Powerbeats earbuds, both of which feature the same H1 chips and software integration as the Apple-branded AirPods lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxY13c"&gt;But the company didn’t show the same love to the Pill line. There was no Pill Plus successor that added support for Apple’s AirPlay standard or one with integrated Siri support. In fact, Apple hasn’t released another portable speaker (under either its Apple &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; its Beats brands), despite its expansion into smart home speakers with the since-discontinued HomePod and the smaller HomePod mini — the sole standalone speaker that Apple currently sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABTA5K"&gt;In the meantime, plenty of other portable battery-powered speakers around have come out to fill the niche that Apple never really explored with its Beats-branded options. There’s the Sonos Roam, which offers both Bluetooth and works with Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/30/17796756/ue-ultimate-ears-boom-3-megaboom-speakers-wireless-bluetooth-price-ifa-2018"&gt;modernized versions of the Ultimate Ears speakers&lt;/a&gt; that the Beats Pill Plus used to compete with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJMmaL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIUeqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>23andMe gets FDA clearance for prostate cancer risk test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="23Andme" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uy8OXvhYgJGjYsaWc4hvahFOxcE=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370969/1089796154.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gvE5eb"&gt;Genetics testing company 23andMe received Food and Drug Administration clearance for its prostate cancer risk test, the company &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s 23andMe’s third clearance for a cancer risk report — the company also has tests for genes that predict breast and colorectal cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnzqD8"&gt;The test screens for a specific mutation on the HOXB13 gene linked with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Men with the mutation, the G84E variant, have around a three-fold higher chance of developing prostate cancer than men without, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25595936/"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found. Around one in 70 people of European descent have the variant, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06KSBc"&gt;The prostate cancer risk report is not yet available to 23andMe customers, the company said. Customers will be able to choose whether or not they want to see their results. Those that choose to see it will also get access to an “educational module” to give them information about how to interpret the results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6ug3h"&gt;23andMe received its first FDA sign-off for a cancer risk screening test in 2018, when the agency cleared its tests for three mutations on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The mutations are associated with higher risk for prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. However, those specific mutations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086494/23andme-genetic-testing-brca-cancer-health"&gt;aren’t the most common mutations&lt;/a&gt; linked to those cancers in the general population — they’re most common among people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. They can offer some information to 23andMe customers but can’t rule out other mutations that are also linked to those cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV8UbS"&gt;The company’s test for genetic variants linked to a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome was cleared by the FDA &lt;a href="https://blog.23andme.com/health-traits/23andme-receives-fda-clearance-for-genetic-health-risk-report-that-looks-at-a-hereditary-colorectal-cancer-syndrome/"&gt;in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That specific type of cancer only accounts for around 5 percent of colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPLPth"&gt;“These reports provide our customers with the knowledge that they might be at risk for certain diseases, including hereditary cancers, empowering them to take appropriate preventative action with their healthcare provider,” Anne Wojcicki, CEO and co-founder of 23andMe, said &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/01/10/2363945/0/en/23andMe-Receives-FDA-Clearance-for-Direct-to-Consumer-Genetic-Test-on-a-Hereditary-Prostate-Cancer-Marker.html"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; about the new prostate cancer test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSxv7r"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/25/5144928/how-23andme-brought-down-fda-wrath-personal-genetics-wojcicki"&gt;initial tussles&lt;/a&gt; with the FDA over its attempts to give people health information based on their genetic code, 23andMe is building a portfolio of medical tools. Along with its three cancer risk tests, the company gives customers information on their risk of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.23andme.com%2Ftest-info%2Fgenetic-health&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22876615%2F23andme-fda-prostate-cancer-risk-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;developing other health conditions&lt;/a&gt; and how their bodies might &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.23andme.com%2Ftest-info%2Fpharmacogenetics&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22876615%2F23andme-fda-prostate-cancer-risk-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;process medications&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060456/23andme-licensed-drug-developed-genetic-database-autoimmune-psoriasis-almirall"&gt;developed drugs&lt;/a&gt; using its database of genetic information on millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moxie Marlinspike has stepped down as CEO of Signal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWtTvsK9M6VXQy22DGFrDh4Acg8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370949/acastro_210125_1777_signal_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldO4TX"&gt;Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike is stepping down as CEO of the company, he announced &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/"&gt;in a blog post on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Executive chairman Brian Acton will serve as acting CEO until a replacement is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgaLsG"&gt;“Every day, I’m struck by how boundless Signal’s potential looks, and I want to bring in someone with fresh energy and commitment to make the most of that,” Marlinspike wrote. “I now feel very comfortable replacing myself as CEO based on the team we have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkUctA"&gt;The company has met with several CEO candidates “over the last few months,” Marlinspike wrote, but the search remains ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEoFGO"&gt;Founded in 2014, Signal has grown into one of the most trusted and robust apps for encrypted messaging. The service has more than 40 million monthly users and is regularly recommended in security guides. Established as a nonprofit, the company is not supported by advertising or app sales, instead relying on donations and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814934/signal-launches-in-app-sustainer-program-donations-messaging-secure"&gt; a recently launched sustainer program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDXg8m"&gt;The app saw a rush of new users in early 2021 in response to a new privacy policy from its competitor WhatsApp — but the success wasn’t without controversy. Workers within Signal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249391/signal-app-abuse-messaging-employees-violence-misinformation"&gt;raised concerns to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s refusal to maintain content policies could lead to potential misuse of the service. Signal’s recent efforts to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22872133/signal-cryptocurrency-payments-encryption-invite-regulator-scrutiny"&gt; incorporate cryptocurrency payments through MobileCoin&lt;/a&gt; have only heightened those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AZNuo"&gt;Marlinspike gave no indication of his plans after leaving Signal, although he has published a number of satirical NFT experiments on his personal blog, including &lt;a href="https://firstderivative.market/"&gt;a derivatives market for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and a token that &lt;a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"&gt;turns into the poop emoji&lt;/a&gt; when viewed from a personal wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about the Shazam Chrome extension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqXZuwGh_djnMXZ6GVk4YQewQe8=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370901/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shazam is available in yet another place.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shazam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQ9wq6"&gt;Today I learned about &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb/"&gt;Shazam’s Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have been out for about a month and can help you identify music playing on the webpage you’re viewing. Having the app directly in Chrome could help you figure out what song is playing in an ad, trailer, or livestream without having to mess around with your phone. (Thanks to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;finding and pointing out&lt;/a&gt; this nifty tool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4avPNB"&gt;The extension does everything I’d expect it to — you go to the tab where music is playing, press the Shazam button, and it’ll try to identify the song. If it succeeds, it’ll give you a link to the song in Apple Music (serving as your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444506/apple-ios-14-2-beta-shazam-identify-music-phone-apps-headphones"&gt;occasional reminder&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;Apple owns Shazam&lt;/a&gt;). It’ll also keep track of the songs you’ve identified in a running list and let you link your Apple Music account. Doing so will let you listen to the entire song in the extension instead of just a preview.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7ApkZRVK2gvI6yNVYB6ZRk3enI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158838/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_10.51.51.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the songs you’ve Shazamed, and listen to them if you’ve connected your Apple Music account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZbU8i"&gt;I had decent luck testing it out — it worked on YouTube, Twitch, SoundCloud, and even Wikipedia. Most of the time, it even got the song right, though that more so speaks to Shazam’s engine than the extension itself. I did occasionally notice that the actual audio coming out of my speakers would get a bit staticky or skip slightly while Shazam was doing its thing, but it didn’t happen every time and wasn’t unbearable when it did. It’s also worth noting that your mileage may vary here — &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/10/shazam-chrome-extension/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and several reviews on the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shazam/mmioliijnhnoblpgimnlajmefafdfilb"&gt;Chrome Web Store&lt;/a&gt; report that they weren’t able to get the app working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEUrCCP_ervdCRcSHUHdqHG0cZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23158659/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_09.55.32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also learned today that Wikipedia captions songs, to incredible effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNBMPU"&gt;I’ll probably keep this extension installed because it’s easy to imagine times when it’d be useful — some tech companies play pretty great music before their livestreams, and I’ve wasted more time than I’d care to admit in the comment sections of movie trailers trying to sus out the song playing in the background. Of course, most of the time, I could just ask Siri what song’s playing (or use Snapchat, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13936586/shazam-now-inside-snapchat-update"&gt;which has Shazam built into it&lt;/a&gt;), but when my phone’s in another room or I’m using headphones, having an extension to do the same thing could come in handy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Greenhouse gas emissions jumped in 2021, despite Biden’s climate pledges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ECONOMY-TRANSPORT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tzvxXFkAQcxN70KxOZDZlGQy83s=/0x0:3263x2175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370860/1236632579.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pbzVum"&gt;After falling more sharply than at any point &lt;a href="https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-2020/"&gt;since World War II&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, US greenhouse gas emissions rebounded from the pandemic in 2021 — likely growing faster than the nation’s economy did last year, according to a preliminary &lt;a href="https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-2021/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by research firm Rhodium Group. The rise in planet-heating pollution risks putting the US’s climate goals further out of reach, Rhodium warns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXIBkn"&gt;Greenhouse gas emissions rose 6.2 percent last year compared to 2020, Rhodium found. That’s slightly higher than initial estimates for economic growth in 2021: a 5.7 percent rise in GDP, according to Goldman Sachs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s the latest evidence that as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;countries return to their old, polluting habits&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522736/carbon-dioxide-co2-record-climate-change"&gt;do little to slow down climate change&lt;/a&gt; in the absence of more intentional pollution cuts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u1yrQQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic will do little to slow down climate change in the absence of more intentional pollution cuts. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KBZfiL"&gt;The biggest culprits behind the US’s jump in pollution last year are diesel trucks and coal plants, Rhodium’s analysis found. Transportation was already the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks"&gt;biggest source&lt;/a&gt; of emissions before COVID-19 stalled economic activity in 2020. But a new trend emerged during the pandemic: demand for diesel outpaced gasoline. As people stayed at home to curb the spread of COVID-19, many picked up new hobbies, fixed up their homes, and shopped online more — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;keeping trucks busy with deliveries&lt;/a&gt;. Road freight was the only category of transportation that saw fuel demand surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5xPOD"&gt;Coal made a notable “comeback” last year, Rhodium says, after &lt;a href="https://grist.org/energy/coal-use-was-dying-then-2021-happened-carbon-emissions-rise/"&gt;falling steadily&lt;/a&gt; for more than half a decade. Coal-fired power generation grew for the first time since 2014. Low natural gas prices have largely contributed to coal’s demise over the years, but last year, natural gas prices soared after an unusual cold snap dealt a double whammy to the US — it froze production and drove demand up for heating. Low stocks of natural gas in the US and abroad &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50778"&gt;continued to keep prices high&lt;/a&gt; for much of the year. At the same time, economic recovery from the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641178/global-power-sector-emissions-rise-pandemic"&gt;upped demand for electricity&lt;/a&gt;. Altogether, it was a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/coal-power-s-sharp-rebound-is-taking-it-to-a-new-record-in-2021-threatening-net-zero-goals"&gt;boon to coal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBluTL"&gt;There was some good news in the Rhodium analysis: renewable energy grew in 2021, reaching 20 percent of US electricity generation for the first time. Solar power is poised to have a pretty good year in 2022 — it’ll make up almost half of all newly installed capacity to the power grid, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50818"&gt;according to the US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zxckiw"&gt;After Joe Biden stepped into office last year, he re-committed the US to the Paris climate agreement and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to slash the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions in half from peak levels in 2005 by the end of the decade. That will require a steady, year-on-year drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Rhodium’s latest tally, however, shows that the US was headed in the opposite direction last year. While the pandemic-related shutdowns dropped US greenhouse gas pollution by more than 22 percent from 2005 levels in 2020, emissions only fell by about 17 percent in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 8 may not have a body temperature sensor after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDkDzzOZvg3BIpaWTSWwvJu1eow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370410/vpavic_211006_4796_0039.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7’s big update was a larger screen, which some found disappointing.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SqtZvC"&gt;If you were hoping for more exciting updates with the Apple Watch Series 8, you might have to start tempering expectations. While it was initially thought that the next-generation watch would have a body temperature sensor, it’s looking like that may not be the case after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVGhLU"&gt;A body temperature sensor for the Series 8 has been heavily rumored for some time now. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman — who has a pretty good track record when it comes to Apple rumors — first hinted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;a body temperature sensor was coming&lt;/a&gt; in June. That was echoed by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; in September for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201#refreshed?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;a potential fertility feature&lt;/a&gt;. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-watch-series-8-thermometer/"&gt;predicted a body temperature sensor&lt;/a&gt; that same month. All in all, there have been several solid reasons to believe this was in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ariKjy"&gt;However, in his latest &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Gurman has backtracked. When speaking about the Series 8’s potential for body temperature sensing, blood glucose monitoring, and blood pressure capabilities, Gurman wrote, “Don’t expect any of these soon, though. Body temperature was on this year’s roadmap, but chatter about it has slowed down recently. Blood pressure is at least two to three years away, while I wouldn’t be surprised if glucose monitoring doesn’t land until later in the second half of the decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLqx2T"&gt;For blood pressure and blood glucose, this makes a lot of sense. While there’s been a lot of headway in noninvasive, cuffless blood pressure monitoring in wearables, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;the technology simply isn’t there yet&lt;/a&gt;. The same applies to blood glucose monitoring. Although the feature was &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rumor-has-it-the-next-samsung-apple-smartwatches-might-1846124296"&gt;rumored for the Series 7 and in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, it never materialized. The tech does exist in a nascent form — a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-are-the-wearables-that-stood-out-at-ces-2021-1846053707?rev=1610579714156"&gt;prototype from Japanese startup Quantum Operation&lt;/a&gt; was featured at CES 2021 — but it’s nowhere near ready for consumer-grade devices. Of the rumored features, body temperature sensors seemed most likely as they’re already available in several other consumer wearables, including those from rivals like Fitbit. In fact, body temperature sensors in wearables gained a lot of attention in 2020, when researchers used them to try to determine whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;smartwatches could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-smart-watch-detect-covid-19-1833409102"&gt;detect COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QjT3c"&gt;Currently, body temperature sensors are mostly used for sleep and recovery tracking, though &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-this-fertility-apps-first-scientific-study-is-so-ex-1834849462"&gt;fertility wearables like Ava&lt;/a&gt; may also feature them. While Apple has added sleep and period tracking in the past few years, they’re on the simpler side. Adding a body temperature sensor would potentially help level up these particular features, especially if the company is planning on adding fertility-related features as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. However, Apple is notorious for sitting on features other device makers have already implemented until it’s happy with its own version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5M4RI"&gt;“Chatter slowing down,” as Gurman puts it, doesn’t mean a body temperature feature is completely dead. However, it does bring up another point: perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect Apple to introduce a new groundbreaking, industry-leading feature every year on its smartwatch. It’s true that since the Series 3, Apple has outpaced the competition when it came to advanced smartwatch capabilities. The Series 3 introduced cellular, the Series 4 changed the design and added FDA-cleared EKGs, the Series 5 added an always-on display, and the Series 6 added a SpO2 (blood oxygen) sensor. However, the additions have been less buzz-worthy starting with the Series 6. Not only have SpO2 sensors been on smartwatches since 2017, but the Series 7’s marquee feature was also just a larger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id9Von"&gt;Right now, the Apple Watch is the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/524806/global-smartwatch-vendor-shipments/"&gt;most popular smartwatch on the market&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple has a yearslong lead on the competition. Wear OS watches are amid a complicated transition to a new unified platform with Samsung. Fitbit and Garmin may have advanced health features and better battery, but they both lag in smart features like cellular connectivity. Samsung comes closest, but many of its health and fitness features aren’t quite as polished.  Technically speaking, there’s no &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for Apple at the moment to dramatically shake things up in the short term — especially as it’s already investing resources in more groundbreaking health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lYak6"&gt;Advanced health features, especially nascent ones like noninvasive blood pressure and blood glucose, will take a while before they’re ready for consumer use. And even when they are “ready,” they’ll probably have to go through the FDA clearance process. In the meantime, it’s more than likely that future Apple Watch updates will focus more on design, incremental hardware upgrades, and software updates that make use of existing sensors. Case in point: Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;also forecasted&lt;/a&gt; the Series 8 would see a rugged sports version and a new entry-level model. That said, perhaps we’d all settle down if Apple could finally figure out how to include multiday battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4riQuZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC’s still in a stalemate a year into Biden’s presidency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-RWj_Us-3s6Jx1ZnNyJdYe5ZH5E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70370245/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmkiI1"&gt;After nearly a year into Joe Biden’s presidency, new pressure is mounting on the Senate to expeditiously confirm nominations for positions at two of the federal government’s top agencies with control over broadband and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDGCMl"&gt;In new statements issued on Monday, public interest groups Free Press Action and Fight for the Future called on the Senate Commerce Committee to fill the final seats at the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Both Gigi Sohn and Alvaro Bedoya, for the FCC and FTC, respectively, have finished their confirmation hearing processes, but neither nomination has received a final committee vote to set them up for floor confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6itOiX"&gt;“Americans are in desperate need of these consumer protection agencies as their dependence on affordable access to the open Internet has grown during the pandemic,” &lt;a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-01-10-senate-democrats-need-to-stop-dragging-their-feet-on-fcc-and-ftc-nominations/"&gt;Fight for the Future said in a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “Industry insiders have openly admitted that they are pushing for these delays because it benefits their bottom line, at the expense of the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3tgbU"&gt;With open seats at these agencies, the FCC and FTC are unable to press forward on any partisan measures or Democratic policy priorities, like net neutrality. Late last year, Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787261/biden-fcc-net-neutrality-jessica-rosenworcel-gigi-sohn-broadband"&gt;was confirmed as FCC chair&lt;/a&gt;, but no votes have been lined up for Sohn, Biden’s pick as the last remaining Democratic commissioner. Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra stepped down from the agency after he was confirmed to lead the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in October, leaving the FTC at a 2-2 deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2BfPD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/04/nominations-sent-to-the-senate-54/"&gt;Biden renominated Sohn and Bedoya on January 4th&lt;/a&gt;, setting the nominations up for further consideration by the Senate Commerce Committee. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2022/01/10/antitrust-enforcers-are-drowning-in-mergers-799773"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the committee plans to vote on nominees on January 24th, and the markup may include Sohn and Bedoya, but the final agenda has not been released as of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TOoiRQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no time to waste”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBS5Bd"&gt;“There’s no time to waste and so much to get done at the FCC: ensuring the billions being invested in broadband actually reach those who need it most, restoring Net Neutrality and Title II, reckoning with media regulators’ history on race and repairing the damage of the Trump years,” Craig Aaron, Free Press Action co-CEO, said in a Monday statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA2Ec3"&gt;As FCC and FTC nominations saw some movement in the Senate last year, Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-media-censor-for-the-fcc-gigi-sohn-joe-biden-nominee-11636408804"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;editorial board&lt;/a&gt; argued that Sohn was a telecom policy extremist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27p3VK"&gt;“Gigi Sohn is a complete political ideologue who has disdain for conservatives. She would be a complete nightmare for the country when it comes to regulating the public airwaves,” Graham said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1458222266395811849?s=20"&gt;in a tweet thread last November&lt;/a&gt;. “I will do everything in my power to convince colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this extreme nominee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsGsnj"&gt;So long as every Senate Democrat, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), votes in favor of both Sohn and Bedoya, no Republican support would be necessary to confirm them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otTWl1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izA6yL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM finally bends the knee to California’s authority to set vehicle pollution rules</title>

  &lt;p id="o2kftz"&gt;General Motors isn’t done wiping the egg off its face from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;misguided decision to back then-President Donald Trump’s failed effort&lt;/a&gt; to take away California’s ability to set fuel efficiency standards. In a letter sent to the state’s governor today, the automaker said it “recognizes California’s authority to set vehicle emissions standards” under the Clean Air Act and offers itself up an EV supplier for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ox1i2W"&gt;This represents a reversal of GM’s position three years ago, when it joined Fiat Chrysler and Toyota in supporting the Trump administration’s escalating battle with the state over vehicle emission rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qetMHf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a reversal of GM’s position from three years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmiuxP"&gt;Under the Clean Air Act, California has historically been allowed to set its own emissions standards, which are tougher than federal guidelines and typically set the bar for the entire auto industry in the US. California is the largest auto market in the US and the 10th largest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" title="Governor Gavin Newsom 1.09.22" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/552080508/content?start_page=1&amp;amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;amp;access_key=key-RPOOQCBwMYWNf7hgABsN" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.7729220222793488" scrolling="no" id="doc_31037" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5GwTZ"&gt;After Trump declared his intention to roll back the Obama-era fuel economy standards, California stated that it would go its own course and keep enforcing the earlier, stricter standards. Trump sued the state, prompting the auto industry to take sides in the legal battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGyinm"&gt;Nearly two dozen states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration in response and other major car companies balked at the administration’s attempt to roll back the fuel efficiency mandate. While GM and a few others supported Trump, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;sided with California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ajVhFQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But after Trump’s defeat, the effort was essentially moot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qomGnU"&gt;But after Trump’s defeat, the effort was essentially moot. President Joe Biden announced his own plan to hasten a transition to electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change — and GM scrambled to get on board. Two weeks after Trump’s loss, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;GM renounced its support for the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; and called on other automakers to join it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhzIec"&gt;Now, the company is furthering its efforts to get on California’s good side, and it seems to be working. The state has agreed to add GM to its list of auto manufacturers to consider for fleet vehicle purchases. This is important especially as GM releases new electric work vehicles, such as the BrightDrop delivery vans and the Chevy Silverado EV pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxF0Tc"&gt;“GM is joining California in our fight for clean air and emission reduction as part of the company’s pursuit of a zero-emissions future,” Newsom said in a statement. “This agreement will help accelerate California’s nation-leading commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We welcome GM in our clean vehicle revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IAJFD"&gt;GM has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and has committed to spend $35 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025. California has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;ban the sale &lt;/a&gt;of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. To date, 14 other states have &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/nevada-california-zero-emission-vehicle-standards/#:~:text=More%20EVs%20for%20Nevada.&amp;amp;text=This%20decade%2C%20Nevada%20will%20become,%2C%20climate%2Dfriendly%20future.%22"&gt;adopted its progressive zero-emission vehicle program&lt;/a&gt; for passenger vehicles, which was launched in the early 1990s and has spurred automakers into developing hybrid and fully electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5rHt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
