    <title>US employment watchdog sues Activision Blizzard over discrimination claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqUW_bMkSQ1_xE-NHCkdJuzFnv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917617/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Mlkm8"&gt;The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has sued Activision Blizzard over its allegedly pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination. The lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.832570/gov.uscourts.cacd.832570.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed Monday in California court&lt;/a&gt;, is based on a three-year EEOC investigation that included cooperation from the games publisher. It seeks a court order requiring the company to cease unlawful behavior and pay restitution to employees who suffered discrimination or retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRy9Za"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-investigating-activision-blizzard-over-workplace-practices-disclosures-11632165080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that Activision Blizzard was in settlement talks with the EEOC, and the company &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-provides-update-workplace-initiatives"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it was “actively engaged in continued discussions with the EEOC.” In its complaint, the EEOC says it notified the company of its findings on June 15th after launching an investigation in September of 2018, then engaged in “extensive conciliation discussions” with Activision Blizzard. But “the Commission was unable to secure through informal methods an acceptable conciliation agreement,” it notes. The lawsuit is now seeking a jury trial over the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="91TxSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Activision Blizzard confirmed it was under investigation last week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZCXBb"&gt;This is the latest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686183/blizzard-chief-legal-officer-leaves"&gt;several legal battles for Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously been sued by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html"&gt;the company’s investors&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674269/activision-blizzard-sued-nlrb-labor-violations"&gt;Campaign to Organize Digital Employees&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; also reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684779/activision-blizzard-investigation-sec-activision-bobby-kotick"&gt;investigating the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhBUvp"&gt;The lawsuits — as well as stories from employees at Activision Blizzard — paint a picture of a company with a “frat house” atmosphere where female employees were verbally and physically harassed without consequence. Multiple executives, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, have departed the company in the wake of the revelations, and the company has updated elements of its games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22638947/blizzard-overwatch-mccree-name-change-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to remove references to employees accused of harassment or other offending behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix reveals how many accounts are actually watching its top titles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n7-bw4P3Om_d_ue89Tupa5Wfn2A=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917512/Netflix_Code_Conference_V2.001_X3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix/Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCrTC0"&gt;During this year’s Code conference, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos shared a significant haul of data about some of the streaming giant’s top titles — a rare move for a company that traditionally holds numbers close to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nii9Cx"&gt;In one slide, shared while Sarandos was speaking on the Code stage with Kara Swisher, Netflix shared numbers about how many accounts viewed its top 10 films and series based on the number of accounts that watched at least two minutes of the title during the first 28 days it was on Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgLM3LisrbnCXX1toaMzWAWE4CI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883239/i_L578TP9_X3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix/Code&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EVadpP"&gt;The first season of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; led its top series list with 82 million accounts having viewed the title, followed by part one of &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher,&lt;/em&gt; with 76 million accounts having watched each. &lt;em&gt;Extraction&lt;/em&gt; led its top films list with 99 million accounts, followed by &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; with 89 million accounts and &lt;em&gt;Spenser Confidential&lt;/em&gt; with 85 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpvNmG"&gt;A second slide ranked Netflix’s top 10 films and series based on their total viewed hours during their first 28 days on the service. &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; still topped its series list with a whopping 625 million hours viewed. The fourth installment of &lt;em&gt;Money Heist&lt;/em&gt; followed with 619 million, followed by the third season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; with 582 million hours of viewing. &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; led its list for most popular films based on the metric, with 282 million hours viewed. &lt;em&gt;Extraction&lt;/em&gt; swooped into second place with 231 million hours viewed, while &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; took third with 215 million viewing hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkEH9w"&gt;“We’re trying to be more transparent with the market and talent and everybody,” Sarandos said. “It’s a big black box for everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s CEO has bad news if you were hoping to see Fortnite NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQD4QE5Oq53CpwdhVzseGZX493Q=/0x0:1863x1242/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917260/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_9.21.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apparently the glowing orb is not an NFT.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s0QjHe"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Epic isn’t touching NFTs, in a public response to what was presumably an NFT pitch. He cites the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;space’s problem with scams&lt;/a&gt; as the reason for his hesitancy, which sparked some &lt;em&gt;discussion&lt;/em&gt; in the comments (as strong statements about crypto tend to do). Sweeney has since clarified his views on NFTs a little, saying that, to him, owning an NFT is about as valuable as liking an image on Twitter and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442541632885182466?s=20"&gt;calling into question&lt;/a&gt; whether NFT ownership is actually non-fungible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9RcG8"&gt;While Sweeney’s publicly made his position clear, it’s not likely to stop him from getting a wave of NFT pitches, which you can see for yourself by searching “@TimSweeneyEpic nft” on Twitter. It’s understandable why people try, though — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417447/fortnite-revenue-9-billion-epic-games-apple-antitrust-case"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has made billions&lt;/a&gt; through the sale of virtual objects, and there’s been a lot of discussion around using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632765/vine-creator-dom-hofmann-blockchain-video-game-nft-supdrive"&gt;NFTs in video games&lt;/a&gt; (not that Epic and Sweeney were small fries before &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; took off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZBYd"&gt;While the NFT space does have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;fake art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;shady goings-on at major companies&lt;/a&gt; (along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;various other scams&lt;/a&gt; that have taken off as NFTs rocketed to prominence this year), that’s probably not why we aren’t seeing V-NFTs take the place of V-Bucks. A more likely answer is that, so far, Epic doesn’t need to use blockchain tech to make money, and NFTs aren’t ready to solve problems like its fight with Apple over what’s allowed in the App Store. It’s not like scams are stopping other well-known companies from diving into the space — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA-licensed Top Shots&lt;/a&gt; has operated without &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/27/investing/top-shot-withdrawal-nba-nft/index.html"&gt;incidents&lt;/a&gt; raising too many eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dda8jx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Replied:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We aren’t touching NFTs as the whole field is currently tangled up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations, and scams.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="AmGOir"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJFPJu"&gt;Interestingly, Sweeney also retweeted part of a semi-viral thread about “Web 3,” or a &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3"&gt;popular concept in the crypto community&lt;/a&gt; of rethinking the web, focusing on blockchains and tokens. The idea is that Web 3 is a return to the decentralized nature of Web 1, as opposed to “Web 2.0,” where most people spend their days on platforms owned by massive companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Of course, cryptocurrency (especially Ethereum) plays a big part in that vision. The part of the thread Sweeney retweeted recalls an early version of the web with open protocols and more community government, though how that relates to the future of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is unclear — perhaps it was just some nostalgia for a web that seems to be long gone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Charge 5, is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7oTw3UgNWOkFUmZpIKKB-E0diDg=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69917127/jpeters_210914_4757_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Charge 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkjLeB"&gt;Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Fitbit Charge 5, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Ftrackers%2Fcharge5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available for purchase&lt;/a&gt;. The $179.95 tracker offers a number of improvements over the Charge 4, including a slimmer design and a bright color screen. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;in my review&lt;/a&gt;, I had some frustrations with the software and the lack of any sort of physical button. And you should know that two of the new tracker’s headline features, an ECG app and the ability to give a new Daily Readiness Score, aren’t available just yet. Those are arriving in the coming months, Fitbit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e68Lfb"&gt;Fitbit is also announcing new features coming to some of its devices for people who subscribe to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fservices%2Fpremium&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Premium service&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $9.99 per month. Snore and noise detection is now available for all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fsmartwatches%2Fversa3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22697200%2Ffitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Versa 3&lt;/a&gt; users who are Fitbit Premium subscribers, and content from the meditation app Calm is now available in the Fitbit app, also for Premium subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>RIP Android TV remote app, hello Google TV remote app </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqSqbj8dB_LJU5bwMHshBHc7RP0=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916955/AFS_01A_VirtualRemote_IJ_Realistic_1x1_Frame_11.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qm4bhr"&gt;Google is killing its older Android TV remote. The move follows the company’s launch of its long-awaited Google TV remote app last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNnlgL"&gt;The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Android TV remote app will take a bow after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;Google TV remote app&lt;/a&gt; — which can be used for other Android TV OS devices as well — is widely available. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/27/looks-like-google-has-put-the-old-android-tv-remote-control-app-out-of-its-misery/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the remote news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8XPRg"&gt;“We’re making the experience of using your phone as a virtual remote control faster to access and easier to use by upgrading the UI and integrating the feature directly into the Android mobile OS as well as the Google TV app,” a spokesperson said. “After the new remote feature is widely available, the Android TV remote app will no longer be supported and available for use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePF7tj"&gt;To use the remote, the Android TV OS television or device will need Android TV Remote Service 5.0, which has already started rolling out. Users will not need to manually update their devices to get it. A spokesperson said that the rollout will continue through this week and will update automatically through the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caV3x9"&gt;The new remote is available to Android users from Quick Settings or through the Google TV app. A spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week that the new remote app will be available only to Android users at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s gamer-friendly C1 OLED is down to its best price to date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWumHjIbdaBffC0XrXG08s6RsW0=/212x0:2497x1523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916840/LG_C1_Lifestyle_Photo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG C1 OLED TV supports HDMI 2.1 and 120Hz Variable Refresh Rate for use with modern consoles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Pz0Nj"&gt;LG’s various OLED offerings include some of the most well-received models across the industry. The C1 OLED is one of these universally praised panels, and it comes in a variety of sizes to fit people’s preferences and home theater setups. Now, some C1 models have received their biggest discounts yet, which may please those with a penchant for large TVs. Amazon, for instance, currently has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch C1 for $1,797&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WGFKSMW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;77-inch model for $2,997&lt;/a&gt;, which factor out to be $703 and $500 off, respectively. For roughly the same price, you can also get either TV with a $100 streaming credit at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65-class-c1-series-4k-uhd-oled-tv-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100761679.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; or a $50 Visa gift card at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FLGOLED65C1PUB%2FLG-OLED65C1PUB-65-Inch-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-with-AI-ThinQ-2021-Model&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22696856%2Flg-c1-4k-oled-tv-ps5-xbox-series-x-amazon-buydig-costco-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhRll2"&gt;These are the lowest prices to date on each of these large displays, both of which feature 120Hz refresh rates and Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, as well as support for VRR (variable refresh rate) and FreeSync and G-Sync technologies, thus ensuring high frame rates without screen tearing. Both configurations of the 4K OLED also support HDMI 2.1 to ensure all these gaming-focused specs work seamlessly with Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5. Another gamer-friendly feature, Game Optimizer, allows you to dial in the ideal settings for specific genres, such as fast-action first-person shooters or densely detailed real-time strategy titles. These features alone make the C1 one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BnbCpR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG’s C1 and G1 OLEDs get even better at gaming with 120Hz Dolby Vision","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/6/28/22554939/lg-dolby-vision-hdr-xbox-c1-g1-4k"},{"title":"The best delas on 4k TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vnZmIS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596469"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5ucxv"&gt;The C1 model, like many OLED TVs, is known for its richer contrast and deep, ink-like blacks, which bring out more detail in the shadows. Dolby Vision HDR also ensures vibrancy and accuracy in the colors, and on the smart side of things, the C1 supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice assistants. It also comes with LG’s speedy, fourth-gen Alpha9 processor and support for LG’s webOS platform. That last one might not earn everyone’s love, but it’s got built-in support for most of the popular streaming apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The beloved Babylon 5 is getting rebooted, and series creator JMS is running the show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxsFJFVFXYtbLVENsMVLnh6LKnk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916698/babylon_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t7sQ06"&gt;In 1994, J. Michael Straczynski (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8673391/sense8-review-matrix-wachowskis-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sense8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling_(film)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;brought the world a science fiction show like nothing we’d ever seen. &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5 &lt;/em&gt;told a single five-year story, filled with foreshadowing, deep political intrigue, and characters who grew and evolved, at a time when most TV shows still reset the agenda after every single episode. He wrote the vast majority of the award-winning show himself, and it appears he may be about to do it again — Warner Bros. Television is now in development on a “ground-up reboot” of &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt; with Straczynski as writer and showrunner, designed to air on the CW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCPYWw"&gt;Here’s the full description &lt;em&gt;Warner Bros&lt;/em&gt;. provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6RJdlV"&gt;In a from-the-ground-up reboot of the original series, John Sheridan, an Earthforce officer with a mysterious background, is assigned to Babylon 5, a five-mile-long space station in neutral space, a port of call for travelers, smugglers, corporate explorers and alien diplomats at a time of uneasy peace and the constant threat of war. His arrival triggers a destiny beyond anything he could have imagined, as an exploratory Earth company accidentally triggers a conflict with a civilization a million years ahead of us, putting Sheridan and the rest of the B5 crew in the line of fire as the last, best hope for the survival of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="G5uUiq"&gt;That’s pretty much a dead-on description of the original show, minus some big surprises. So as a long-time fan myself, I have extremely mixed feelings! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REM7L5"&gt;In one sense, it’s pretty exciting because Straczynski told fans&lt;em&gt; for years&lt;/em&gt; that Warner Bros. wanted nothing to do with the show ever again. “They literally told my agent ‘We have no plans, and no intentions, of letting anything else be done in terms of television with Babylon 5,’” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/987208419558834176"&gt;he tweeted in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and that seemed to be that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZvWHPJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Won't work.  They literally told my agent "We have no plans, and no intentions, of letting anything else be done in terms of television with Babylon 5."  And a kickstarter wouldn't pay for even a fraction of a season.  That won't change for years, when those execs are dead/gone. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NZ80WiIIcR"&gt;https://t.co/NZ80WiIIcR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— J. Michael Straczynski (@straczynski) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/987208419558834176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zt4Kzs"&gt;So if Warner Bros. and Straczynski have now abandoned their feud and might expand on the intriguing universe JMS built nearly three decades ago, that’s pretty exciting. But if it’s just a straight reboot rather than a sequel or spin-off, one aimed at the CW at that, it makes me wonder why bother — particularly when the excellent original series has a newly remastered version you can stream on HBO Max and purchase &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5SYHS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;via Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Ftv-season%2Fbabylon-5-the-complete-series%2Fid1149081337%3Fmt%3D8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22696836%2Fbabylon-5-reboot-j-michael-straczynski-warner-bros-the-cw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; since January of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eb0678"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10776756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yrcBFR"&gt;Sure, the remastered version still has its issues. &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; has a great story about &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-22-babylon-5-digital-video-quality.html"&gt;why the original &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/em&gt; will never look its best&lt;/a&gt;, partly due to aging CGI that might have looked groundbreaking at the time. Some of the early episodes feature hamfisted plots, scenery-chewing actors and a general lack of subtlety, and I can see how they might turn off a modern audience used to shows like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14429646/expanse-season-2-syfy-relevant-science-fiction-show-television"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (&lt;/em&gt;Straczynski &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/1441658114973974531"&gt;certainly still seems to feel&lt;/a&gt; the first season is worth it, and I think you’d lose a lot by skipping it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zJtQXG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10776767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oEDk3i"&gt;And while the remaster’s 4:3 transfer does an excellent job of cleaning up old artifacts and counteracting the bonkers decision to &lt;em&gt;zoom in&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the low-quality CG (see examples above and below), the noisy footage still doesn’t necessarily look great on a 4K TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLx4hd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10776769"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aBl072"&gt;Still, it’s there’s never been a better time to watch &lt;em&gt;Babylon 5 &lt;/em&gt;in the modern era than this remaster, which is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better than the DVDs. You just might want &lt;a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Viewing_Order"&gt;this guide to the agreed-upon proper viewing orders&lt;/a&gt; since HBO Max and co. seem to have ordered the episodes in a new way entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Overwatch League grand finals were a storybook sendoff ahead of Overwatch 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Erc8OrOnP_XhRlLIhWSa41bZ4X4=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916614/MY_DRAGONS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QlZTaC"&gt;The Shanghai Dragons’ very first &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; match was an 0-4 shellacking delivered by the Los Angeles Gladiators in 2018. The team would go on to lose the next 41 straight games — encompassing the entire first season of the league and the first two games of the second season — earning them the dubious honor of having the longest losing streak in esports history. The Shanghai Dragons’ very last &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; match of 2021 — and the last professional Overwatch match ahead of the sequel’s launch next year — was a 4-0 beatdown they themselves visited upon the Atlanta Reign to win the 2021 Grand Finals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2rDEw"&gt;It is a long-time fan in-joke to call the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League “scripted.” Like a TV show, teams are given story arcs, villains and heroes are cast, and any match that ended &lt;em&gt;just so&lt;/em&gt; was pre-determined by a writer’s room. That the Shanghai Dragons are the team that closes the chapter on professional &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; as we know it is proof positive that some kind of cosmic force is at play. Stories that good just don’t happen by chance, and yet, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UauZKU"&gt;The Dragons’ grand finals run started off inauspiciously. In the first round, higher-seeded teams were given the opportunity to choose their opponents. Shanghai, as the highest seed, got first pick and decided to choose the San Francisco Shock as their opponents. Oh no.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_8K3EA_J-1iMB5qMPRY8bqLphQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882673/OWL_Press_Asset_BZ655Q.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The San Francisco Shock after winning the 2020 Overwatch League Grand Finals over the Seoul Dynasty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tagXKz"&gt;The Shock are the winningest team in the league, period. They are the only team to have completed a “golden stage,” meaning they won all seven games in a stage without losing a single map — just straight 4-0s across the board. They are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the only team that’s won back-to-back championships. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; they are the team that sent Shanghai into the loser’s bracket during the 2020 playoffs. In the previous nine matches between these two teams, Shanghai has &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/19/20699180/shanghai-dragons-overwatch-league-stage-3-champions-explainer"&gt;only won one of them&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s easy to see why I thought this was a terrible pick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Pv5si"&gt;My concerns were unfounded as Shanghai made quick work of San Francisco, bouncing them to the lower bracket with a 3-0 embarrassment. But my relief didn’t last. The Dallas Fuel was their next big challenge after having lost to them in the May Melee earlier in the season. When the playoffs began, I said that the finals &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League 2021 deserved was Dallas vs. Shanghai. The only other team even close to Shanghai in performance has been Dallas. Fuel vs. Dragons was the rivalry the league’s writers demanded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkLRly"&gt;And, by the grace of Goddess Victory, Shanghai came out on top again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KElUJ8"&gt;By this point, I’m sweating. Yes, my Dragons are in the grand finals, but the Shock are destroying the loser’s bracket, sending Philadelphia and Chengdu home — two teams stuffed with big Dark Horse Bracket Busting energy. More than anything, I do not want a 3-peat. I have no personal animosity toward the Shock, I simply find dynasties boring, and for a moment, it looked like the Shock of old were back, ready to reclaim their crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIJ7TF"&gt;But then I was granted a boon from an unlikely source: the Atlanta Reign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZG74AQ4F13LNMvPxsW6guUQ6fo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882679/OWL_Press_Asset_BZ61AX.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Atlanta Reign&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y7sN0S"&gt;I’ve always enjoyed Atlanta. They’re a neat team with an incredible tank line and excellent proof that you don’t need a mono-culture team to have success. Atlanta’s always been the gatekeepers of the upper rankings — good enough to keep everyone else out but never good enough to break through themselves. So imagine my shock (heh) when they’re the ones to grant me my wish of eliminating San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5h6Cm"&gt;Then they beat Dallas, and then I got scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGCICn"&gt;As I said, the playoffs are built differently. Good teams fall fast, and mediocre teams suddenly rise from nowhere. Dallas was a devil Shanghai knew. Atlanta wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWMSVD"&gt;No grand finals match has been terribly competitive. The Philadelphia Fusion won only a single map of the eight played against London for the inaugural championship. After being tied in their head-to-head records and tying in stage playoff wins, San Francisco sent Vancouver home in 2019 four to nothing. Only Seoul has made a grand finals match interesting, and even then, they lost to the Shock 4-2. I hate when games are blowouts, especially finals. But for this final between Atlanta and Shanghai, I wanted total domination. My heart did not have the strength to endure a close match. And, in keeping with the tradition of one-sided grand finals, Shanghai granted my wish. There was no magical moment like there was when the Dragons &lt;a href="https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2019/2/28/18243584/shanghai-dragons-win-first-game-boston-uprising"&gt;finally won their first match&lt;/a&gt; ever against Boston in 2019. No screaming or crying — just me observing Shanghai wipe out Atlanta in overtime and going, “that’s it, that’s the game.” After four years, the Shanghai Dragons’ redemption arc is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwsS1Y1G-Er62t24GoQCGkaaTdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882683/OWL_Press_Asset_BZ61AZ.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Shanghai Dragons&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9eFlfT"&gt;The Dragons are a lot of firsts and a lot of lasts. They’re the first team to lose every game in a season. They’re the first (and only) team &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/14/17012010/overwatch-league-first-female-player-geguri-shanghai-dragons"&gt;to field a female player&lt;/a&gt;. They were the last team to win a stage championship before the league changed its format, and now, they are the last team to win a championship in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 1&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NL9VDO"&gt;Jon Spector — &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League commissioner — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spex_J/status/1433889109349650435?s=20"&gt;confirmed that the next season will be played on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The switch in game brings with it a host of other changes. The starting lineups for teams will reduce in size from six players to five, and the much-maligned assault map type will be replaced with push — a map type in which teams fight to control a robot that pushes a payload. We even got a glimpse at what competitive play will look like in 2022 with an exhibition game of league pros demoing &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; during halftime. The changes are interesting, and while I’m eager to see how &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; will transform the league, that excitement is tempered by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;abuse, harassment, and discrimination allegations&lt;/a&gt; levied at its developer, Blizzard Entertainment, and the news that Chacko Sonny, Overwatch 2’s executive producer, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22686563/overwatch-2-boss-quit-activision-blizzard"&gt;has left the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DE1Jck"&gt;As I celebrate my Dragons, mourn the end of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; prime, and continue to watch Blizzard implode in slow motion, I am reminded of the reason I came to this game in the first place: its community. Some of my best friends and colleagues have come from my time as a fan and a reporter, and my favorite memories come from matches I saw live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJUx12"&gt;I’ve never truly participated in a sports fandom before, and yet, I latched onto this esport and the Shanghai Dragons with it, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/why-im-a-fan-of-owls-shanghai-dragons-even-after-they-went-0-40/"&gt;with such fanatical devotion&lt;/a&gt; that a tattoo of their logo is now a foregone conclusion and a promise fulfilled. I know that the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League was never scripted, but I’m glad the league’s story ended like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxeYft"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epm3eK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

LoveFrom’s output has remained somewhat unknown &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761736/jony-ive-apple-leave-iphone-chief-design-officer-lovefrom-company-quit"&gt;since Ive left Apple to start the design firm in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and Ferrari marks just the second high-profile partnership for the company following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527824/apple-designer-jony-ive-airbnb-hired-lovefrom"&gt;a separate deal with Airbnb last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJuxlb"&gt;Details on what LoveFrom is actually doing for the luxury carmaker or Exor are slim. “The first expression of this new partnership will bring together Ferrari’s legendary performance and excellence with LoveFrom’s unrivalled experience and creativity that has defined extraordinary world changing products,” Exor writes, without explaining what the companies will do together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yDUwvO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whatever LoveFrom works on, it’ll probably be expensive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7eVHC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c2436fb5-d857-4aff-b81e-30141879711c"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that partnership includes contributions to Ferrari’s first electric car, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ferrari-ev-bumped-to-2025/"&gt;plans to introduce in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Ferrari also has a connection to a current Apple executive in Eddy Cue; Apple’s senior vice president of services &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ferrari-ev-bumped-to-2025/"&gt;sits on Ferrari’s board of directors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKCyBv"&gt;Both Jony Ive and Marc Newson have well-documented opinions about modern cars — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/2/16/8045625/jony-ive-apple-modern-car-design-is-shocking"&gt;they’re “insipid”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/14/9154871/apple-marc-newson-hates-modern-car-design"&gt;“at the bottom of a trough”&lt;/a&gt; — so it would be fascinating to see what they would do with an electric Prancing Horse. But it seems just as possible LoveFrom creates a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2022-ready-to-wear/ferrari"&gt;five-figure jacket or handbag instead&lt;/a&gt;. Like with Airbnb, the one thing that can be guaranteed is an exchange of clout. Ferrari and Exor are, at least in part, paying to attach their brands to the good design taste for which Ive and Newson are known. Maybe that’s worth more than connecting them to any one specific project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7xY21"&gt;What’s more certain is that it helps raise the profile of the duo’s design firm which, until now, remained even more ethereal than Ive’s hardware designs for Apple. The company and its work are so hard to grasp that the first result in a Google search of “LoveFrom” &lt;a href="https://lovefrom.style/"&gt;is a fan site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pzRn1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is brightening up your Gmail avatar with new illustrations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOK5nFKr0Pd6vqxj4Q2lN2-jb3Q=/190x0:811x414/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69916548/Collage_cover_1_YAP7dMt.max_1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Some of Google’s new illustrations | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1MV3zC"&gt;Google has created new images designed to be used for your Google profile picture, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/get-creative-google-illustrations/"&gt;the company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The new images, called Google Illustrations, look quite nice, and they could also be useful for people who want to associate an image with their account but don’t want to use a photo of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFlr6l"&gt;Google looks to have a wide variety of options, some of which you can see in the image at the top of this post. And you can see more in the below GIF, which shows different categories of images such as animals, technology, and space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJNZgx2OFmw6aqJUxwkvRIyaSVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882554/Selection_variety.mp4_1.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pwVDj1"&gt;The new library of illustrations indicates that Google is taking a different approach from avatars like Snap’s Bitmoji or Microsoft’s Xbox avatars, which can let you make stylized representations of what you look like. Google’s new illustrations instead give you a wide variety of generic things and places to use for your avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1rY3A"&gt;Right now, however, the illustrations are only available to Android users, according to Google. If you’re on Android, you can set one as your profile pic in Google Workspace and Contacts on Android — follow the steps in this GIF from Google if you want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3yoD8fKN-kuBGgBcqcZk4MuQx-I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882532/Entry_point_3.mp4_1.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aQcW48"&gt;Google says it’s “working on” bringing the new illustrations to iOS and web and to more products. The company says it’s also going to expand the collection of illustrations available, so if you don’t see one you like now, check back when Google has added more.&lt;/p&gt;
