    <title>‘Huge leap’ for NASA’s Mars helicopter ushers new mission support role</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A frame from Ingenuity’s navigation camera during its ninth flight over Mars’ Séítah region.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Rboo"&gt;The Séítah region on Mars, filled with rocks and sand dunes, was too treacherous for NASA’s Perseverance rover to drive across. So Ingenuity, the tiny helicopter accompanying the rover, flew over the area on Monday and snapped some photos of a key spot on the other side. In less than three minutes, Ingenuity spared Perseverance the months it would have had to spend driving to take its own photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iEhjh"&gt;The quick Monday morning jump across Séítah was Ingenuity’s ninth flight on Mars so far, but it marked the first time the chopper lent a helping hand to Perseverance in its hunt for ancient signs of life at the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater. The four-pound helicopter arrived on Mars on February 14th, attached to Perseverance’s underside, and became the first object to take powered flight on another world on April 19th. Its initial set of flights served as increasingly complex practice tests to demonstrate how off-world rotorcraft can buzz around places that wheeled rovers can’t go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lgIy9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This was a big leap — &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; leap — in terms of what we’ve done before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjEXK9"&gt;But on Monday, NASA engineers pushed Ingenuity’s limits further than ever. In 166 seconds, Ingenuity flew roughly 11mph for almost a half-mile, or 2,050 feet — a far greater distance than its most recent flight in June, which tallied 525 feet. The copter buzzed around different corners of Séítah and snapped photos of its borders, where junctures between different rock formations — called contacts, in geology lingo — make for some of the most scientifically intriguing targets in Perseverance’s hunt for fossilized microbial life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzrTxs"&gt;“This was a big leap — &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; leap — in terms of what we’ve done before. We went between sites that were 620, 625 meters apart, which is enormous compared to what we’ve done before,” Ingenuity chief pilot Harvard Grip said in an interview. Ingenuity’s photos, expected in the coming days after traveling down a delayed Mars-to-Earth data pipeline, will help engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory decide whether to send Perseverance on a path to scoop up rock samples in that particular contact region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JoqCG"&gt;The mission is “designed to be high risk, high reward, so that means it makes sense for us to take those additional risks because of the potential payoff,” Grip said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The flight path for Ingenuity’s ninth flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GMwDnB"&gt;Ingenuity, originally designed to fly on short trips from point A to B, dipped into one of Séítah’s eroded craters, slowed its speed, then ascended up slopes for the first time while dancing along a zig-zagged path. Its autonomous navigation algorithms were written to anticipate flying over only flat terrain, so engineers tweaked the code and convinced the helicopter that Séítah’s bumpy features were flat. That demanded several simulations in preparation for the flight, mainly to predict whether the helicopter could potentially spin out of control under its new flight directions. No accidents occurred, and Ingenuity successfully reached the targeted rock formation on the other side of Séítah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4koYox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Let’s go big, and let’s take a risk and get across Séítah”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XtGAWo"&gt;“This was the first time where we really said, ‘Let’s go big, and let’s take a risk and get across Séítah,’ which we know is an extremely challenging terrain for a rover to traverse,” Ken Williford, deputy project scientist for the Perseverance mission, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coTLEP"&gt;Sending a tiny drone across a potentially dangerous field of thick sand to scout for cool Mars rocks is a huge time-saver for the Perseverance team. “When scientists can get those images of that contact early, we can start the science process much earlier than we would otherwise, and start to make observations and interpretations and understand what those rocks are,” Williford says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZfHUmt9NfiETz_5PlklVMxGoEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705706/25964_PIA24600_web.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of Séítah, taken by Ingenuity in May during its sixth flight. Newer images of Séítah from the helicopter’s ninth flight weren’t immediately available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uzv8pw"&gt;The rover has its own cameras, primarily designed to analyze nearby rocks and Martian landscapes. And sensors aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a satellite roughly 155 miles above Mars’ surface, give the Perseverance team imagery of far-off rock targets but lack the close-up details a helicopter like Ingenuity can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19Kodf"&gt;The helicopter was set for retirement after its first five flight demonstrations to let the Perseverance team focus on its own work. But after Ingenuity aced its fourth flight in late April, engineers decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412154/nasa-ingenuity-aces-fourth-flight-mars-advance-new-testing"&gt;expand the craft’s mission&lt;/a&gt; on Mars to demonstrate how helicopters could help future rovers conduct science. Some of Ingenuity’s midflight photos taken during test flights were convenient for Perseverance scientists, but Monday’s flight marked the first time that it took off with a sole mission to help the rover’s science team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fDoBTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A very unique interaction” between Perseverance and Ingenuity teams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnzMQ4"&gt;NASA leadership approved Ingenuity’s mission expansion on the condition that it doesn’t perturb or interfere with Perseverance’s core mission, Williford said. A small “interface” team combining engineers from Perseverance and Ingenuity, serving as the operational glue between the two missions, has since been expanded to include Perseverance scientists as Ingenuity proves itself more scientifically useful than expected. For most NASA missions, these interface teams sometimes spark debate and disagreement as eager scientists negotiate technical risks with more risk-averse spacecraft engineers. But the Ingenuity-Perseverance team is surprisingly smooth, Williford says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYffH7"&gt;“This has been a very unique interaction, where I can go in there and say, ‘You know what would be so fantastic? Is if we could get over here,’ and then to hear Bob Balaram [Ingenuity’s chief engineer] say, ‘Yeah, let’s do it!’ and really pushing his team to go further,” said Williford, who also works as the director of JPL’s Astrobiogeochemistry Laboratory. “It’s been one of the most fun things that I’ve ever done, really. Working with those engineers and a few other scientists to plan these flights, I feel like a 12-year-old kid again, honestly.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The UK is considering legal protections for animals’ feelings — so what do animals ‘feel’?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lesnye Klyuchi fur farm in Russia’s Stavropol Territory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tYuEEVw4fH0zeNsfY1XzcELf-D0=/0x138:3775x2655/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555924/535848134.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="frmJrQ"&gt;Animals with spines in the UK could soon be legally recognized as “sentient” beings with feelings if a &lt;a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2867"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; being debated in Parliament &lt;a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2021/june/lords-discuss-key-areas-of-animal-welfare-sentience-bill/"&gt;moves forward&lt;/a&gt;. Should the bill become law, it could get lawmakers to consider animals’ feelings, like pain or even joy, when crafting any new policy. The bill is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57072922"&gt;larger push by the government&lt;/a&gt; to set high standards for animal welfare in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PrhQ5m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Are animals used for food or fur bored in their pens?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I23c7j"&gt;That raises a lot of questions for humans. Are animals used for food or fur &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049180&amp;amp;utm_source=baytoday.ca&amp;amp;utm_campaign=baytoday.ca&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;bored&lt;/a&gt; in their pens, for instance? And what do you do with an individual who might react differently to a situation than its peers, based on its unique personality? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GF4fs"&gt;If passed, the bill would create an “Animal Sentience Committee” in charge of evaluating how well the government considers those feelings in its policies. For now, the bill focuses on vertebrates; animals with spines. But there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/animal-welfare-sentient-uk-parliament/2021/07/04/44593460-d8df-11eb-8c87-ad6f27918c78_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_evening_edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3415776%2F60e372da9d2fda8060f80c90%2F596a4fb9ae7e8a0ef33cf3d7%2F43%2F54%2F60e372da9d2fda8060f80c90"&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; from animal rights advocates to expand its proposed protections to invertebrates, like octopuses and lobsters, that have recently surprised scientists with what they’re capable of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803207/"&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; and potentially &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221001978"&gt;&lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRRRXI"&gt;To better understand what it means for an animal to “feel,” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Kristina Horback, director of the Animal Behavior and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Davis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Qday"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xaWrum"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know this can get a little complex but, first of all, how do you define sentience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSbs3B"&gt;In teaching undergraduates at UC Davis, I use a definition of: capable of sensing environmental cues — sensation, perception, and then responding to those cues. In that definition, you include invertebrates, insects, so many things. But there’s definitely confusion with taking a philosophical slant in adding feeling — not only feeling but consciousness, awareness of that feeling. That’s where it gets really muddled, trying to “prove” consciousness: the actual acknowledgment of “I’m experiencing pleasure right now” or “I’m experiencing pain” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kEPJpM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s where it gets really muddled, trying to ‘prove’ consciousness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKAC7F"&gt;Right now, there’s a lot of focus on pain, which is understandable. We’re seeing some evidence of learned behavior, where the animal will avoid certain areas in their environment where they experienced pain. For example, some fish species will avoid an area where they were once hooked in their mouth. So we have enough evidence of the experience of pain, and learned behavior from that experience of pain — but it’s going to be really difficult to have sufficient evidence right now that the animal is on a conscious level of, “Wow, that hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o6KvR"&gt;This is where I think a lot of this legislation comes into play, is “shouldn’t we kind of err on the side of caution?” In particular, there’s this interest in vertebrate mammals and birds that have the same brain structures, they’re showing the same behavioral responses that we see in humans in terms of body postures, or learned changed behavior for experiences of pain and anxiety and stress. Shouldn’t we assume that they are also experiencing that on a conscious level? But that gets heavy in philosophy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eD87CC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has our understanding of animal sentience changed over time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGIPM6"&gt;Well, I think you can go back as far as philosophers like Rene Descartes, who viewed them as automatic machines where information goes in from the environment and then they just have sort of reflex responses and that’s it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QURsNm"&gt;But we’ve had a really great merging of other psychologists, cognitive scientists, and primatologists. Think of your classic Jane Goodall, people who actually sit and take time to view the animals and say, “Now hold on, there’s a lot more going on than just in and out in terms of response to the environment or response to finding a mate, survival, and that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSrznV"&gt;I think it’s just taken time for humans to become more clever to design experiments where we can acknowledge the capacities of other animals. We are so limited because we are primates ourselves, that all we think about is vision and spatial cues. But that doesn’t work for dolphins, you know. We’ve got to think like the species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FURi3Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re no longer viewing animals as just robotic objects”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZdDQi"&gt;It was really neat to see it spark so many different fields in terms of, what about personality? Or what about boredom? Do animals experience boredom? Because we’ve already kind of had an acceptance that animals experience pain. But these other levels of complex experiences like boredom or guilt — a lot of scientists are getting together to see, can we find evidence of that? We’re no longer viewing animals as just robotic objects that take in information and spit out information and just survive and die. There’s a lot more going on in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbYqKY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we can say now that animals have personalities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBicgp"&gt;Yes, there’s certainly so much literature out there — going from insects and reptiles and birds to your great apes and marine mammals — looking at personality. It could be an animal of the same sex, and the same family group, and the same rearing environment, but one is always more aggressive than the other or one is always more cautious than the other. You know, there’s a style in terms of how they respond to their world. That’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AJ0iAr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a style in terms of how they respond to their world. That’s personality.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azPNbT"&gt;In terms of comparative psychology and animal welfare science, you know, we all are aiming at understanding capacities and experiences of &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; animals. I think it’s a wonderful progression. I think it’s pretty easy for a lot of humans to acknowledge differences among their pets, and this is just kind of expanding it out now in terms of livestock or lab animals even. We want all lab animals to be the exact same, but the thing is, they’re not. That’s what I think is moving forward. It’s not just, “the lab rat does this.” It’s, “Well, it depends on…” you know, and then finishing the sentence because they’re individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1za3IN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact might this bill have if it passes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kY0Owa"&gt;It’s easy to see how it relates to farm animal treatment, like new housing requirements or enrichment requirements, or the treatment of animals in transportation. And then it could kind of expand to the import and export of livestock. If you put a bunch of sheep or cattle on a ship and send them somewhere, is that going to be changed now? That’s kind of the level I see it directly impacting commerce and trade for these products. And then it could get even larger. If we’re still just sticking to vertebrates, that can expand to fur animals or so many other uses of animals in medical fields. If it goes forward, a lot of things need to move as well to make it work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H7w9x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndXeBG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZckU4N8rhNAvTM3h79RZ4Q17Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525167/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with the public betas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RGStJw"&gt;iOS 15 and iPad 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;kicking off their public betas today&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few weeks with the developer betas of the new software, Apple’s OS updates feel like more of a grab bag of new features than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGHjhM"&gt;A major rethinking of either platform, this year’s updates are not. The two updates were clearly born in 2020’s norm-shattering pandemic. The feature list at WWDC and on Apple’s website wears last year’s remote-first influences firmly, from the heavy emphasis on FaceTime features to a better system for corralling notifications into “work” and “personal” buckets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCtoK8"&gt;Of course, Apple’s release cadence and insistence on major updates coming just once a year means that some of these features are arriving in what will — hopefully — be a post-pandemic return to life this fall. So it’ll be interesting to see how things like SharePlay, one of the update’s marquee features, actually shake out once people have the option to watch movies and listen to music together in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82OTUS"&gt;Other parts of iOS and iPadOS 15, like the overhauled Safari app or the new Maps app, feel like the kinds of more noticeable changes generally associated with Apple’s major software updates, but they’re sporadic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D4var"&gt;The result is a software update that feels a lot quieter than Apple’s usual releases, one that — at least for now — looks to improve smaller things behind the scenes than rebuild things from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-YOwTs3Mxm7lXWTL3BFGCCtW8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689245/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iOS 15 homescreen is largely unchanged from iOS 14. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGKdwT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceTime and SharePlay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nan3wn"&gt;The flashiest feature coming to the fall updates is SharePlay, a new Apple-wide system built on top of FaceTime for sharing TV shows, movies, music, and podcasts with friends and family even when you’re not in the same room. It’s also the most pandemic-inspired feature, an Apple product-based spin on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307583/watch-videos-movies-online-friends-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-scener-extensions"&gt;countless watch party apps and services&lt;/a&gt; that sprung up to replace movie nights over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="warmv9"&gt;SharePlay shows off how well Apple’s hardware and software services all work together: watching a TV show or listening to an album over FaceTime is seamless. But it also highlights the height of Apple’s walled garden: developers have to choose to use SharePlay — which is missing big names like Netflix and YouTube right now — and it only works on Apple hardware, despite the expansion of FaceTime and the Apple TV app to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FEgxPx_dNvDn7GZ-gzLRUEouR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691037/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_10.11.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k8DJV1"&gt;And since content is streamed locally, everyone watching or listening has to have access to it, meaning that you can’t share an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;with a friend who’s not a TV Plus subscriber, nor can you both watch the same movie if only one of you has purchased it from iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXcJ1T"&gt;FaceTime is also getting a wide variety of long-overdue updates that help cement it as a more viable video chatting application: a sorely needed grid view, screen sharing, a portrait mode to blur your messy background, and the ability to FaceTime with Windows and Android users (in web browsers) thanks to sharable links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGPKYn"&gt;These are all badly needed features for FaceTime, but they’re also the sort of thing that remains bewildering to have had to wait until September 2021 for, especially given the reliance on video calling over the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YfJml"&gt;Unlike SharePlay, though, the FaceTime improvements feel like the kind of thing that will remain front and center even as things start to go back to normal, although the Apple product focus and more limited feature set when compared to professional solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that FaceTime won’t be making a play for business meetings any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tEy0Z1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZhK4nw"&gt;As is traditional for an iOS update, Apple has done some tinkering with notifications on iOS 15. Some of the smaller notifications are bigger now, and feature contact images — which might be the push to get people to actually add photos to their contacts, something that doesn’t generally exist in the real world outside of an Apple presentation in my experience. And apps that you care less about can be filtered to a new summary mode that’s delivered several times a day, instead of pinging you for each notification right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVieJE"&gt;But the bigger addition is the new Focus feature, and after only a few weeks of using it, it’s already one of my favorite features on iOS in years. On the surface, Focus is an expansion of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb feature, but instead of a blanket mute, Focus allows you to select specific apps and contacts to share notifications at specific times or specific triggers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wwnvgScnLVZ0lgi5r3_OifdHWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691389/focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus settings (left), the expanded Do Not Disturb menu (middle), and Focus-siloed notifications (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7U7n"&gt;A “work” Focus, for example, can be set to activate when you’re on the clock and mute all notifications except from your email, Slack, and calendar apps, then automatically switch off when you’re off work. Focus modes can be triggered by specific times, locations (like when you get to your office or home from work) or when opening a specific app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="trNbrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus gives you real control over filtering notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRnXl4"&gt;So far, I’ve mostly just been using a “personal” focus for weekends and evenings to automatically mute any work Slacks and emails until the morning, which has been absolutely delightful. Apple’s machine learning also tries to learn from how you use your phone — for example, it suggested that I add a sports app I use a lot during “personal” time to the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnjYef"&gt;And while Focus can be used in conjunction with Apple’s Screen Time feature, it’s not a totally cohesive system: for example, there’s no way to automatically disable work apps like Slack when in a “personal” Focus mode. It just shuts off notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qA9Ae"&gt;Focus also lets you assign specific homescreen pages to each Focus mode — including widgets — for even more customized experiences. iOS has also added the option to add duplicate icons for apps (so you can still have Apple Music visible on both a “personal” and a “work” homescreen, for example). But I’m a big fan of the feature, since it gives me a good reason to actually set up homescreens with widgets, and helps curb the instinct to tap the Slack icon when I’m supposed to be offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg2Joz"&gt;There’s also a new kind of notification to go with Focus and the morning summary feature, called “Time Sensitive Notifications,” which can override specific notification filtering features, so you don’t miss urgent alerts from your bank, for instance. Apple has specific rules for when developers can use these, but we’ll have to wait to see how they’re actually implemented when apps get updated this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eQJ6s9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari explores a new look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sa-F42U9akLG4HUc8T5Q-CFoKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691391/safari.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Safari’s new design, with the rearranged URL bar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mrCBnF"&gt;Safari has been entirely redesigned in iOS 15. In terms of material changes to iOS, this is the biggest, and it’s coming to what might be the most essential application on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP04AG"&gt;For the iPhone in particular, that means an emphasis on a one-handed design that moves the URL bar to the bottom of the screen, adds a swiping gesture interface, and a tab grouping feature (which is also coming to iPadOS and macOS Monterey). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ7LM1"&gt;I’m still getting used to it, even with a few days of use under my belt, and of all the additions in the latest software update, I suspect it’ll be the most polarizing. Over a decade of muscle memory has trained my brain to reach up for the menu bar on smartphones. I get Apple’s motivation in moving it to the bottom, making it easier to reach on the increasingly large phones it makes and putting the actual content of devices front and center at the top of the screen, it’s still a change that’ll require an adjustment period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCUCdYYVSJw438QnZ8SDpmQE4lU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689246/cgartenberg_210629_4653_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iPadOS 15 allows for widgets on the homescreen now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j5vaNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad multitasking: what’s a computer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="luHkRC"&gt;Overall, iPadOS 15 gets a lot of the same improvements as the iPhone update. There’s a few iPad-specific features, though, starting with two major features from iOS 14 that were oddly missing last year: widgets on the homescreen and the App Library (which comes with a spiffy animation when you open it). I still can’t explain why Apple didn’t add those features last year, but they’re extremely welcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4rff1"&gt;Widgets, as expected, work even better on the iPad than they do on the iPhone, given the bigger homescreen. It’s not as big of a sacrifice to give up a quarter of your homescreen for widgets when there’s still so much extra space on the screen. Apple has also added even &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; widget sizes, the biggest size of which is roughly the same area as an entire iPhone 12 display when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Despite the massive size, Widgets still have the same functionality as they do on the iPhone, meaning that they’re focused on glanceable information rather than more interactive mini applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaF2Fz"&gt;Apple is also continuing to refine multitasking on the iPad with two new additions: a multitasking icon (three dots at the top of the display) that makes it easier to use the different split-view and slide-over modes it introduced in 2019, and a “shelf” that shows all the open windows for a particular app when you open it or tap the multitasking icon. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vQ2rbcsyuXVwyn4YZJjxh2girI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691086/IMG_0008.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on iPadOS 15 is still... a lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbzDBs"&gt;The new multitasking setup is better, albeit still slightly confusing. Putting a single app into split view using the new menu punts you back to the homescreen to select a second app (or the same app again) to view in split-screen mode. Apps can be dragged and dropped when you’re in the app switching window to create new split-screen or full-screen combinations. The multitasking dots light up to show which app in split-screen is in focus, which is incrementally better than the bar from before. And swiping down on the multitasking dots is now an almost home-button-like experience, closing that app and letting you select a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ndrGX"&gt;There are still a lot of ways to move things around and arrange things and keyboard shortcuts available — so much so that Apple has a new menu when you hold the globe key to view system and multitasking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqls37"&gt;But there’s still plenty of friction here. iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my homescreen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yAG2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An iPad operating system with iPad apps — and that’s just how Apple likes it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxrfpE"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. Apple may do some additional tweaks or changes before iPadOS 15 launches this fall, but it’s unlikely to do any sweeping design changes for this update. iPadOS is still firmly an iPad operating system with iPad apps, and that seems to be how Apple likes things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3jMKY"&gt;Also new is a Samsung-like “Quick Notes” feature that lets users swipe up from the bottom corner of the display or hit a keyboard shortcut and scribble down a thought, highlight text on a website, or add a link for context. Quick Notes get saved to their own category on the Notes app, and can be accessed from other Apple devices, too. They’re useful, although like many iPadOS 15 features, it’s not something you’d likely figure out how to use without outside prompting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w8vdJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sRILU7"&gt;As is always the case, there are dozens of bigger and smaller features coming in iOS and iPadOS, too. Here are some of the more notable ones to check out on the public beta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKJ4ez"&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive part of the updates, letting you point your camera at any handwritten or typed text to grab a phone number or email address, translate it, or pull it directly into a text field. Apple has quietly made this a system-level feature — meaning that it’s available whenever you’re viewing an image, be it in the live camera feed, an image on the web, or directly from the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="7eJg3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live Text might be the most technically impressive update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cDWpCArz45zoW0gA6_K0S7khj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691400/text_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Live Text on iOS 15 can capture text directly from a photo feed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbDOvr"&gt;An interesting new addition on both operating systems is a new “Shared with You” feature, which shows photos, Apple Music songs, links, Apple TV Plus content, and podcasts that were shared over iMessage in dedicated rows within those apps. The theory is that if someone texts you a nice photo or their favorite playlist, you’ll be able to see it (and respond to it) in the Photos or Music apps. The feature is unsurprisingly entirely limited to Apple services for now, so sending a Spotify song to someone won’t appear in Spotify. It also might be overestimating how often users send links to TV Plus shows to each other, but showing shared links and photos are admittedly useful (at least, when the feature works properly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F8nIP"&gt;The Weather app has an overhauled design that adds a vertical, Dark Sky-style 10-day forecast and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature and precipitation. It looks nice. Notes and Reminders are both getting hashtags for categorizing and organizing, and the Memories feature in Photos is getting completely overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpcLX"&gt;Lastly, you can now put your Memoji avatars in outfits. I have no opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4gSsb6Ov3LMeV40ABqou9nGmF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691105/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1O7u7A"&gt;A lot of the other flashy new features are things we can’t test yet. Apple’s beta is only rolling out new maps to the San Francisco Bay Area to start (although it’ll be in far more locations when the final software is out this fall). IDs and keys in Wallet will also have to wait for broader support from state governments, hotels, and workplaces before we can see how those work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3fEA5"&gt;There are also a lot of features that will have to wait for third-party developers, like Focus statuses or SharePlay in third-party apps, which also have to wait for app updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MvxOuP"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V6Offf"&gt;The most notable thing from my time with the betas, though, is how easy it is to miss the newer features. Outside of the most in-your-face updates like the larger notifications or the new Safari design, most of the updates here are quieter, behind-the-scenes features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bVfAK1"&gt;They’re things that give you more options and ways to use your devices, but they’re just that — options. Focus modes are great for those who want to use them and integrate them into their workflow, but iOS doesn’t go out of its way to advertise them or push you to use them. It’s a mature way of looking at software, and one that’s nice to see, even if it means that iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t the most exciting updates ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBtdHM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDORv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; iOS 15 added the ability to have multiple app icons for a single app. This article originally stated that it was still not possible to do so. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeep says it will have ‘zero-emission’ SUVs in every category by 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Stellantis Mack Assembly Complex Is First New Detroit Auto Plant In 30 Years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-daoCymMCWy9TrElniJDFn5eSc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555765/1233378850.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4J1b81"&gt;Jeep says it will have “zero-emission” SUVs in every category of its lineup by 2025, the automaker announced Thursday. That same year, the company also plans to offer 4xe plug-in hybrid versions of all of its vehicles. The news came as part of an electrification strategy event by Jeep’s parent company, Stellantis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsAgTN"&gt;That means there will be electric versions of the Wrangler, Cherokee, and Wagoneer, in addition to Jeep’s other models, by 2025. Jeep also unveiled a plug-in hybrid version of its luxury Grand Cherokee SUV during the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6W7JFl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now Jeep, which is touting its 4XE plug in hybrid technology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 2025, Jeep will offer “zero emission” models in every segment. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YaZ8LBP3PB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YaZ8LBP3PB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew J. Hawkins      (@andyjayhawk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andyjayhawk/status/1413124612230111236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QfDfxX"&gt;Jeep, an iconic American brand, has been slow to embrace electric vehicle technology compared to its competitors. Today’s announcement is meant to be a course correction, outlining the automaker’s commitment to an electric future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzxM2i"&gt;Meanwhile, its sister company, Dodge, delivered a more muddled message during the same event, vowing never to sell electric cars but also promising an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568272/dodge-electric-muscle-car-2024-stellantis-ev-day"&gt;all-electric muscle car by 2024&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV8IM6"&gt;Stellantis is the latest automaker to host an event briefing investors on its electrification strategy. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450840/tesla-battery-day-production-elon-musk-tabless-range-cathode-cobalt-plaid"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557900/volvo-ev-concept-recharge-electric-battery-range"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; have produced similar events. As the fourth-largest carmaker in the world, Stellantis has the global scale to drive EV sales — if it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMwQtH"&gt;Earlier this year, Jeep unveiled an electric concept car, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344578/jeep-wrangler-magneto-concept-ev-manual-transmission-stellantis"&gt;the Wrangler Magneto&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the 2020 Jeep Wrangler Rubico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvpJ2l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s new Resident Evil show brings zombies to the White House</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/isgTRMbVc9OcXBH3ZBrOVJW96wc=/182x0:1739x1038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555754/e4_4s009_320_cmp_v007_010F_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zZXoGE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt; is a show that’s made for people who &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; lore. The most recent games in the series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have largely gotten away from the story of Racoon City and more typical zombie tropes, instead focusing on more standalone horror stories that are starting to resemble &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22447646/resident-evil-village-vampire-lady-horror-movies"&gt;an anthology of sorts&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s still a place where the Umbrella Corporation and Racoon City loom large: tie-in movies and TV shows. &lt;em&gt;Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt; is the latest, a four-episode series on Netflix that really leans into the political intrigue behind the zombie outbreak. There are some fun moments, like when undead monsters infiltrate the White House, but the show is mostly interesting as a supplement to the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccZfz9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt; takes place after the events of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; and features longtime &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; leads Leon Kennedy (introduced as “the guy who saved the president’s daughter”) and Claire Redfield. There’s a lot going on. Initially, Leon is summoned to help investigate a cyberattack on the Pentagon, which the secretary of defense is convinced was carried out by the Chinese government. Meanwhile, Claire is helping to build schools in a fictional Middle Eastern country called Penamstan, which also happens to be 1) of strategic importance for both the US and Chinese militaries, and 2) a Raccoon City-like testing ground for the zombie creating T-virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPA4U3"&gt;So you have two global superpowers dancing around a war, a small country being used as a guinea pig for a dangerous virus, and a cure for that virus being used to create completely obedient super soldiers. Instead of implements of terror, in &lt;em&gt;Infinite Darkness,&lt;/em&gt; zombies are just another tool for powerful men to use to generate either power or wealth (or both). The show doesn’t really have much to say beyond that, other than maybe capitalism is bad — particularly when it involves selling a cure for becoming an undead monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwV7Xy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rzHqdVVewU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTCjyV"&gt;The problem isn’t just that the show’s politics are mostly just a backdrop; it’s also that it tries to cram too much into a relatively brief runtime. Watching &lt;em&gt;Infinite Darkness &lt;/em&gt;is a bit like watching a video game cutscene that tries to rapidly run through plot points so players can get back to the action. There are so many flashbacks and conspiracies with multiple layers that it can be hard to keep track of what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vpi9D9"&gt;That said, the fact that the show often resembles a video game sometimes works in its favor. The best moments in &lt;em&gt;Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt; feel like they were ripped out of a survival horror game. Early on, after a power outage, zombies stalk the darkened halls of the White House, and it’s slow and terrifying, like a classic &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game. Similarly, there’s a tense moment on a submarine infested with zombie rats, where Leon and friends are forced to fight without guns, so they don’t pierce the hull. The show even ends with what’s essentially a boss fight against a superpowered zombie with a glaring weak point. There are dumb one-liners — Leon says “hey sexy,” to a bazooka — and set pieces where an entire level building collapses around the heroes as they attempt to make a daring escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8sUcT"&gt;Some tie-ins are meant to lure in new fans, while others are designed to appease existing ones; &lt;em&gt;Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt; is most definitely the latter. It’s for people who actually want to know what Leon was up to after saving the president’s daughter and who wonder about all of the ways a zombie virus can be exploited by governments and corporations. It’s for people with a vested interest — and those who miss the simple days of Raccoon City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQbYq3"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is streaming on Netflix now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dodge will make an electric muscle car in 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15Ox10v0bCONegvU5hk6g6K4cF4=/171x0:2189x1345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555593/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_8.53.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yKeVn7"&gt;Dodge announced it would make an all-electric muscle car in 2024. The news came as part of an event Thursday covering electric vehicle strategy by the automaker’s parent company, Stellantis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W68D9C"&gt;The announcement about the electric muscle car was a little muddled as it came a few minutes after Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis proclaimed forcefully that Dodge would not “sell electric cars — it will sell eMuscle,” which is apparently Dodge branding for its future EVs (we assume, it was a little unclear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohv4sR"&gt;“If a charger can make a Charger faster, then we’re all for it,” Kuniskis said, touting the company’s commitment to tire-squealing horsepower and performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cpfkrc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AWD EV “eMuscle” from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dodge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Dodge&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/O8UkGP49Ei"&gt;pic.twitter.com/O8UkGP49Ei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Welton (@BrownDogWelding) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BrownDogWelding/status/1413124495792017409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XtR3jz"&gt;Despite that declaration, Kuniskis said he recognized that there is a “limit” to what gas-powered vehicles can deliver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfjVbd"&gt;“Our engineers are reaching a practical limit of what we can squeeze from internal combustion innovation,” he said. “They know we know that electric motors can give us more. And if we know of a technology that can give our customers an advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcS57G"&gt;Stellantis is the latest automaker to host an event briefing investors on its electrification strategy. Previously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450840/tesla-battery-day-production-elon-musk-tabless-range-cathode-cobalt-plaid"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557900/volvo-ev-concept-recharge-electric-battery-range"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; have produced similar events. As the fourth largest carmaker in the world, Stellantis has the global scale to drive EV sales — if it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giQFoH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Does Amazon even know what it’s buying with the MGM acquisition?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s3mTr82jwQirdXV9WHulOaPtZak=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555514/1232974607.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C3AWKn"&gt;When Amazon announced its plans to acquire MGM in May, the primary focus of discussion was what Amazon planned to do with the studio’s intellectual property. Spin-offs and reboots were one possibility cited by the company at the time. Who, it’s now worth wondering, will shepherd Amazon’s creative vision for the legacy movie-maker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lG9ok"&gt;A new profile published this week in the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/business/media/mgm-amazon-michael-deluca-pamela-abdy.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the creative brain trust behind the MGM brand offers a few clues about how the acquisition may look moving forward. Namely, it profiled Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, two of MGM’s top brass who have tasked themselves with reinvigorating the MGM brand. Key to their strategy, as De Luca described it to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, is “treating the filmmakers like the franchise.” Both seem to value high-caliber theatrical releases over the straight-to-streaming content churn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzOZUp"&gt;But their approach to pumping blood back into MGM’s decaying legacy seems to counter Amazon’s own vision for the studio. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, said in a statement at the time the acquisition was announced that the “financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team. It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rXnraN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MGM has said its focus is on filmmakers and “original ideas”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ozCW8"&gt;MGM’s library may offer some potential for franchise spinoffs, sure — primarily with future &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; films and potentially IP like &lt;em&gt;Legally Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rocky&lt;/em&gt;. (Though it’s worth noting that MGM does not outright own the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; IP, which may or may not have eluded Amazon executives hoping to wring the franchise dry.) Yet its strength has always seemed to be more in the overall brand and talent. Amazon’s desire to own IP feels as if it operates counter to that reality, and De Luca and Abdy seem particularly aware of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56YmCA"&gt;“Mike and I did not sit down and say let’s raid the library and remake everything,” Abdy told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; of the pair’s creative roadmap. “Our focus is original ideas with original authorship and real filmmakers, but you know every once in a while something will come up that’s fun and we’ll pursue it if we think it makes sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iXJlO"&gt;The specifics of this deal immediately call to mind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/22/13366904/att-hbo-cnn-time-warner"&gt;acquisition of Time Warner&lt;/a&gt;, which included the HBO haul of award-winning films and series, by AT&amp;amp;T, which has since decided that maybe this whole streaming thing wasn’t the move after all — even &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; having valuable IP in properties like DC and award-winning content like &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and countless other hit titles&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;CEO John Stankey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451111/att-ceo-stankey-unleash-assets-warnermedia-discovery-hbo"&gt;said in May&lt;/a&gt; at the time the Discovery and WarnerMedia merger was announced that it was “time to unleash the media assets” it had gobbled up and spun into HBO Max — but not before prompting a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/hbos-executive-exodus-challenges-1200322/"&gt;mass exodus of company executives&lt;/a&gt;, most visibly HBO boss &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hbos-chief-richard-plepler-who-greenlit-game-of-throne-1832977037"&gt;Richard Plepler&lt;/a&gt;, who had been with the company for nearly three decades and helped HBO scoop up numerous awards and accolades. He’s now producing content for Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qaF3tY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The studio’s own plans for its IP seem to counter Amazon’s streaming ambitions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NuOzEr"&gt;Any division among company executives for how an MGM and Amazon merger should look moving forward is its own can of worms. The deal also still requires government approval, and it’s reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546106/ftc-investigation-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;being reviewed&lt;/a&gt; by a Federal Trade Commission run by one of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;biggest antitrust critics&lt;/a&gt;, Lina Khan. The merger has also won the ire of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1397550303306731528"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidcicilline/status/1397589036668174341"&gt;lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556369/elizabeth-warren-ftc-review-amazon-mgm-acquisition"&gt;letter to Khan&lt;/a&gt; said the acquisition “could harm consumers and workers and reduce innovation by inhibiting competition in numerous markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3EFFO"&gt;Should the deal secure government approval and move forward unscathed, Amazon may face new challenges in tapping the rich library of legacy franchises unchecked. Unlike AT&amp;amp;T, it will almost certainly be forced to find common ground with the current creative heads of the studio it’s attempting to buy, at least where MGM’s most valuable IP is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cix88k"&gt;Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/features/james-bond-no-time-to-die-barbara-broccoli-michael-wilson-1203466601/"&gt;maintain creative control&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; franchise, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that their “hope is that [Amazon] will empower Mike and Pam to continue to run MGM unencumbered.” The pair additionally told the Times that they had Amazon’s word that the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; films would continue to premiere in theaters, meaning that the company wouldn’t be able to churn out films that premiere exclusively on its streaming service Prime Video, which makes the logistics of this deal even more confounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Orhrnx"&gt;We’ve yet to see how Amazon’s content ambitions for MGM will play out and how the studio’s IP may shape the company’s Prime Video streaming service in the future. But its stated plan to “reimagine and develop” titles may prove more challenging than it had initially anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maingear Element Lite review: the competition is too good</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Intel’s cookie-cutter laptop is behind the competition while costing more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HUwXCz"&gt;The Element Lite is not the kind of laptop that Maingear usually makes. Compared to its fleet of game-ready laptops, this one stands out with a sleek, minimalist, and thin aluminum-clad design. It’s the only machine in Maingear’s current lineup of laptops that doesn’t have a dedicated graphics chip. Unsurprisingly, it’s lacking in the gaming department by comparison, but it’s practically bursting with other niceties you’d usually find in other high-end productivity laptops, like a Windows Hello IR webcam, Thunderbolt 4, USB-C charging, long battery life, and a touchscreen. Its speakers are good, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adRdCk"&gt;This out-of-left-field laptop is actually Intel’s NUC M15 design with a Maingear logo slapped on it. In case the name isn’t ringing a bell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price"&gt;my colleague Dan Seifert got a first look last year at this reference laptop&lt;/a&gt; designed by Intel. It was created to help level the playing field for smaller OEMs that can’t usually compete in the ultrabook space against leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Microsoft, while also showcasing the latest tech and features from Intel. This isn’t the first time that Maingear has co-opted an Intel white label laptop, either; &lt;a href="https://maingear.com/element/"&gt;Maingear’s Element&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s spin on the previous NUC model that was more gaming-focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXd3Eq"&gt;Maingear isn’t the only company getting a NUC M15 to call its own. Brands like &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745473784129018545" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adata&lt;/a&gt;, Eluktronics, ByteSpeed, and Simply NUC are each selling their own take, and naming their own price (though only Adata and Maingear are listing products for sale currently). Maingear officially set the starting price for the Element Lite at $1,399, but at the time of publishing, it only offered models starting at $1,649 with 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM and going up from there. The model that I tested has 2TB of NVMe storage and 16GB of RAM, costing $1,849. The Adata laptop I mentioned earlier is priced at a much more reasonable $1,699 and has 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pl1XzRpmL_X5b75xGv4HUoklWNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677699/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Element Lite doesn’t look like Maingear’s other laptops — in a good way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhjEqiv2pX4vmOIgF26Pgq022-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677702/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key layout is good, but they’re more spaced out than I’m used to with other laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XQ7shZ"&gt;The Element Lite is a good productivity laptop in terms of specs, but it lags behind the competition in some key ways. Its 16:9 aspect ratio display feels cramped, and its keys are spaced a little too far apart. It’s also too expensive. A sale or discount could help, but even then it’s tough to recommend over a handful of laptops that have equally capable (or better) specs or more appealing features combined with a lower price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R0Jrex"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10641439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEG5HA"&gt;Apple’s 13-inch Macbook Pro with an M1 processor has a more compact chassis, and it rivals the power of Maingear’s machine for $150 less (or $350 less if you want to settle for 8GB of RAM instead of 16GB). If you want to stick with Windows 10, Microsoft’s 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 has a higher-res display, a sleeker design, and a superior keyboard. You can also find this model with similar specs for about $150 less than Maingear’s offering. Both of these models also have displays with a more generous aspect ratio than the Element Lite, which is a boon for productivity work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOTVzK"&gt;As I mentioned, the Element Lite has an identical set of features &lt;a href="http://intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/205490/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-kit-lapbc710/specifications.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and components&lt;/a&gt; to other NUC M15 variants, like a glossy, glass-covered 15.6-inch, 1080p touchscreen with a 60Hz refresh rate and a 16:9 aspect ratio. This laptop is a showcase for Intel’s latest innovations, including an 11th-gen processor and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. It has an Intel Core i7-1165G7 quad-core processor (base clock of 2.8 GHz, boost clock of 4.7GHz), and Intel’s Iris Xe powers the graphics — all in a portable chassis weighing less than four pounds (3.64 pounds, to be precise). There are four microphones embedded into the top edge of the display enclosure, and a light underneath the trackpad will illuminate blue when you summon Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with the wake word (if you choose to install the app, otherwise it does nothing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FE8wj1BM5rvN_KQndiz4iYezXQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677695/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the left side of the Element Lite offers in terms of ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rvidWm41je1GnASyJ2S7llFmgrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677697/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what you’ll get on the right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9F4o0D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10641452"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sSKIQM"&gt;The all-aluminum design of the Maingear Element Lite (also found in the rest of the NUC M15 models) is very reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8375735/apple-macbook-pro-retina-review-2015" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous generations of the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Its sharp edges and rounded corners are familiar, as are the black, backlit keys that sit in a recessed section, and the silver color of the aluminum chassis. Even smaller details from that lineup are present, like an indentation that allows its easy-lift lid to open with just one finger, and a center-aligned glass trackpad. Double-tapping the trackpad’s top left corner will turn it off (a white LED lights up to indicate that it’s inactive). The keyboard has backlit keys that feel good to type on, and I have no complaints about the layout — aside from the keys feeling a little too spaced out. For a productivity laptop, I expect to hit the ground running with the basics, and the keyboard was a hurdle that led to typing errors during my first few days testing the Element Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woBAMe"&gt;The 15.6-inch display in the Element Lite claims to reach 300 nits of brightness. That’s bright enough to use in a window-filled cafe, but the glossy display means you might need to move the laptop if you’re catching too many reflections. Otherwise, the screen quality is up to par for productivity work — as much as I wish it were a more spacious 16:10 or 3:2 aspect ratio screen like you can get on Apple or Microsoft’s laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG4jmU"&gt;The Element Lite provides about as many ports as I expect for a thin and relatively lightweight laptop. Its left side hosts a Thunderbolt 4 port, HDMI out, and a USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 3 port. The right side has another Thunderbolt 4 port and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 3 port next to it, as well as a headphone jack and a Kensington lock. Conveniently, you can use either Thunderbolt 4 port to recharge the laptop, and the compact 65W power adapter comes with a long cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CdYSNZiSz9a2rlWkATx9zPWB3f0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677696/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This laptop has no issue staying relatively cool and quiet, despite its large air outlets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xpts0Scn35uTw9eaWVDx5fNGIKs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677701/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top bezel is loaded with infrared and proximity sensors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gAUba7"&gt;Battery life is one of the Element Lite’s most impressive assets, even if Maingear doesn’t list it as meeting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Intel’s own Evo standard&lt;/a&gt;. During normal use at work with about 15 tabs open in Microsoft Edge, with Spotify and the one-off Zoom call mixed in, it lasted well into a second day of work, or about nine hours. I likely could have extended it a couple more hours had I just been typing and browsing, but it was tough to resist blaring music through this laptop’s speakers. They’re surprisingly good, even at loud volumes. Sound doesn’t resonate with bass here, but songs don’t have that shallow, tinny profile that you’re usually stuck with on most other thin laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JhHiC"&gt;I’m pleased with the 720p Windows Hello IR webcam, which logs me in quickly when I wake the computer from sleeping. The video quality of the webcam isn’t fantastic, but it works as intended. What I appreciated about this particular setup is its optional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654083/dell-business-laptop-latitude-7400-express-sign-in-login-hands-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;proximity-based feature that can lock (and unlock) the computer&lt;/a&gt; if you walk away from it, or approach it. It was satisfying to use; my music on Spotify paused when it went to sleep, then the screen powered on when I walked near it and my music started playing once it unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfY80c"&gt;Now, Maingear is typically associated with gaming, but this laptop’s name, the Element Lite, is a clue that gaming isn’t a talent it’s particularly adept in. Still, the fast processor, capable integrated graphics, and fast RAM help it achieve passable gaming performance, depending on the game. In &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, a first-person shooter that we’ve managed to run at respectable frame rates on other machines that lack a dedicated graphics card, the Element Lite reached 60 frames per second while plugged into power and with medium graphical settings. Impressively, its fans weren’t audible with the laptop’s volume set to less than halfway. Still, I wouldn’t suggest this laptop to anyone who games on a regular basis, unless those games happen to be older games that have low system requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qOCDgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10641444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9oylE"&gt;I couldn’t help but notice that the Element Lite is a bloatware-free experience with just a few Intel applications pre-installed to get the latest drivers and to tweak the audio settings. That marks a refreshing change, as many Windows laptops (both in and outside of the realm of gaming) are usually loaded with umpteen apps that are often unnecessary — and at worst, obtrusive to the experience. To the credit of Intel’s vision, few Windows laptops can compete with the Element Lite’s bloatware-free user experience, and that helps this laptop feel as much like a reference Windows device, as it is a reference 15.6-inch thin laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFVqG4"&gt;If you’re interested in the Element Lite, that means your interest is piqued in the NUC M15 generally. To that end, I suggest that you find the best deal — regardless of whose brand is lasered onto the lid. As for how much storage you get built-in, don’t sweat it too much. The RAM is soldered onto the board, but you can add your own NVMe M.2 SSD by opening up the bottom, which is a great perk for such a thin laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mbwSiWuOXWHWf4z8EJyc9YoK-zk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677700/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0005.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This laptop will blend in nicely at a cafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDwCUE"&gt;The Element Lite is a well-rounded machine, but the competition is too tough for this kind of laptop to stand out — even if you’re able to wiggle the price down a bit. In addition to the MacBook Pro with the M1 processor, or the Surface Laptop 4 that I mentioned above, you’ll likely be better served by other productivity-focused models like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s Gram 17&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419899/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro 360&lt;/a&gt;, which cost less than Maingear’s Element Lite and offer better specs or nicer displays. With the options above, you can find one with a higher resolution screen, one with an OLED screen, a more generous screen aspect ratio, or just more versatility with a 2-in-1 design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9mJOAP"&gt;Intel didn’t need to pack in all of those features to push back against the competition. Going with a taller aspect ratio and dropping the price might have been enough to change the conversation. But as it stands now, if you’re looking for a premium Windows laptop for productivity work, you’ve got plenty of better options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet adds Duo-style filters, AR masks, and effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gP7K7sKhUnsxa0zvKwYhevt2udg=/2x0:2159x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555235/msedge_tKfr8feqve.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs0xIC"&gt;Google Meet is getting new video filters, effects, and augmented reality masks for personal calls on iOS and Android, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1412822085316005889"&gt;the search giant has announced&lt;/a&gt;. They’re available via the sparkle icon at the bottom right of your video feed during a call, which brings up a carousel of different effects that include color filters and animated AR face effects. Most of the options are only available for personal Gmail accounts, while Workspace users have to keep things more professional with a limited selection of blurring and virtual background options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPFL4o"&gt;The new video effects are the latest example of Meet’s shift from targeting enterprise and business users, to targeting consumers more generally after Google released Meet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;free to personal Google accounts&lt;/a&gt; last year. The filters are very similar to what’s &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/duo/family-mode/"&gt;already been available&lt;/a&gt; for Google’s consumer-focused Duo video chat service, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/08/14/sources-google-meet-replaces-duo/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company plans to eventually replace Duo with Meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fNnvWd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Add cats, astronauts, jellyfish and more to your Meet calls. New filters, masks and effects are now available for Meet on Android and iOS. Try it today → &lt;a href="https://t.co/DDSvWFxDG8"&gt;https://t.co/DDSvWFxDG8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hylhsCcUuj"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hylhsCcUuj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google (@Google) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1412822085316005889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdhb8f"&gt;If trying to make sense of all of Google’s messaging products is making your head hurt then don’t worry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;you’re not alone&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, we might soon have one less Google service to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI’s Pocket 2 4K vlogger cam now comes in white</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DQyp08VU3wK8OMHCKapAwafFPs=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555206/203213365c1a2725c963a07e84f8b654_ultra.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DJI’s Pocket 2, now in white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PJUfC"&gt;DJI’s latest handheld stabilized vlogging camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524505/dji-osmo-pocket-2-price-release-date-features-4k-video-gimbal"&gt;the Pocket 2&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fae%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fdji-pocket-2-sunset-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568152%2Fdji-pocket-2-white-vlogger-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available in white&lt;/a&gt;. The camera released last year only in black features a larger sensor and double the amount of microphones as its predecessor, the DJI Osmo Pocket. The new colorway follows a number of software updates DJI has made to the camera since its original release, with benefits including enhanced autofocus, support for HDR video, and better subject tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVyZAs"&gt;The white Pocket 2 is available to buy now from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fproduct%2Fpocket-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568152%2Fdji-pocket-2-white-vlogger-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s currently listed at $439 as part of a bundle that includes a mini control stick, cover, handle, smartphone adaptors, power cable, wrist strap, and a sling strap. And yes, everything barring the power cable also comes in white. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GBK9jHpqE_Z8goIwq3X7p9ZqX7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705441/2efe9be2a5cb40c3965057d0db76e57a_ultra.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accompanying accessories are also available in white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o1VvXc"&gt;As well as a new color of the Pocket 2, DJI has also recently released a new firmware update for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21517121/dji-ronin-s2-sc2-rs2-rsc2-gimbals-announced-price"&gt;Ronin S 2 camera gimbal&lt;/a&gt;. It adds new functionality for a host of Panasonic, Sony, Canon, and Leica as well as some bug fixes. Full release notes for the update are &lt;a href="https://forum.dji.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=245823&amp;amp;extra=page%3D1%26filter%3Dtypeid%26typeid%3D561%26typeid%3D561"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
