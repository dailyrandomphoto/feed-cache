        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Audio is a well-reviewed option from Google, and even more worth considering now on discount.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S285r3"&gt;The world of smart home accessories grows each year, with the occasional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;new idea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;latest iterations on mainstay staples&lt;/a&gt;. This segment also heats up around the holiday shopping season and Black Friday as discounts become available, which is ideal because so many of them make great gifts. If you’re invested at all in Google’s Nest products — or you’re looking to dive in and test the waters — this week’s deals have a variety options you might want to strongly consider. Right now, there are significant discounts on Google Nest products at multiple retailers, including Best Buy, Wellbots, and more, encompassing smart speakers, video doorbells, home security, and smart displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCuzTH"&gt;First off, and leading our selection of Nest deals, is the latest Google Nest Audio smart speaker. No other smart speaker sounds this good in this small of a form factor, and at such a convenient price. This week the Nest Audio is available for the all-time low price of just $60 — making it a very compelling option as a solo speaker or paired with a second unit in stereo. That’s a full $40 off its usual retail price of $100, and you can pick it up at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUCWHFwCy2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-audio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81539079%3Fpreselect%3D80209773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Daudio%3Fvariant%3D39689491578928&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1597174-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01586_us_nest_audio_charcoal.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or even the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_audio?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; itself. The Nest Audio comes in chalk, charcoal, sand, sage, and sky colorways. Having options is nice, and having options for such a well-reviewed speaker is even better. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WxX8RS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAUnMC"&gt;The Google Nest Hub established its roots as the Google Home Hub, debuting in 2018, and was beloved for being such a convenient window into a shared stream of Google Photos imagery. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530609/google-nest-smart-home-brand-merging-hub-max-rebrand-io-2019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rebranded as the Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; and followed up with a sequel for a second generation. Now, the second-gen model has lain a bit dormant on making big changes or massive innovations that really improve the original formula, but it is still a worthwhile digital picture frame and small smart speaker accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mUlsl"&gt;At a discounted price of just $50, a full 50 percent off its usual $100 asking price, it’s a worthwhile consideration for your home or the home of any loved ones. You can easily set up a shared album on Google Photos and have your family members see the pictures on the Nest Hub as they’re uploaded to the cloud. You can pick one up in the available colors of chalk, charcoal, mist, or sand at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUC5Y0GZPi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-2nd-gen-smart-display%2F-%2FA-82678346%3Fpreselect%3D79796810%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629831-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01331_us_nest_hub_2_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NCJzBb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLfxMr"&gt;If a Nest Hub seems a bit quaint, and you prefer living large, there’s also a deal on the Google Nest Hub Max. The Nest Hub Max is the supersized sibling to the standard Nest Hub, with a 10-inch display in lieu of seven inches and a bigger speaker for more room-filling audio. The Nest Hub Max’s fuller sound, built-in camera, and larger screen lends itself better to tasks like videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVqkED"&gt;The Nest Hub Max is currently on sale for $179, an equal discount of $50 compared to the standard Nest Hub. You can pick it up in chalk or charcoal colorways at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDg6C53KX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dhub%2Dmax&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Charcoal%2F842552117%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max%2F-%2FA-78295230%3Fpreselect%3D76500129%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1499418-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00426_us_nest_hub_max_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller Nest Hub may be the better deal when it comes to the out-of-pocket expense, but don’t sleep on the versatility of a bigger screen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UmjEFR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625470"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="67FNYt"&gt;The latest version of Google’s Nest Doorbell is a smart video doorbell that is battery powered and can detect subjects automatically. Being battery powered allows it to work remotely with a Nest Mini for an audible chime or connect to home wiring to use an existing doorbell chime. Atop the oblong-shaped doorbell is a video camera capable of 30 frames per second recording and object detection for people, packages, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFOBUX"&gt;Normally $180, and announced just in August, the Nest Doorbell is already seeing a significant discount. The sale price this week drops the Nest Doorbell down to $130, saving you $50 in any of its ash, ivy, linen, or snow colorways. Once again, you have your choice of retailers offering this deal: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDsbIb4ns" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dwireles%2Ddoorbell&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Video-Doorbell-Camera-Wireless-Doorbell-Security-Camera-Snow%2F983055336&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wallmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery%2F-%2FA-84283100%3Fpreselect%3D82685731%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1657265-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01318_us_nest_hello_video_doorbell.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_doorbell_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zQwtRP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840099"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z3gFD"&gt;Google’s offering for home surveillance don’t stop at your front porch and protecting your packages. It has even more options in the Nest line of security cameras for indoor and outdoor use, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many of which are recent additions&lt;/a&gt; but already available for exceptional deals this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjgRLc"&gt;Starting from the outside, Google’s outdoor Nest Camera with floodlight is designed to monitor things outside the home — normally best suited to being posted up above a garage door or adjacent to a front door. It has object detection like the Nest Doorbell, and it can send a live feed to a Nest Hub display inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5mWKF"&gt;The Nest floodlight camera is currently $50 off, dropping the price to $230. This, as well as the following deals on Nest cams, is quite exceptional since none of these products have been out very long. Though you can pick up this one for the $230 sale price at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDyQfR21g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-cam-with-floodlight%2F-%2FA-83702962%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dcamera%2Dwith%2Dflood%2Dlight%3F%5Fpos%3D7%26%5Fsid%3D6c742401f%26%5Fss%3Dr&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1657422-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02411_us_nest_cam_with_floodlight.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="t9KG9g"&gt;Moving from outdoor to indoor / outdoor duties, the standard battery-powered Google Nest Cam is also on sale, available as a standalone unit or in a two-pack. If opting for one camera, the current $30 discount yields a $150 deal price. Or you can opt for a two-pack at $280, saving you $50 off the standard $330 price. Buying in bulk offers more value, and these lights offer the versatility of battery-powered usage in the home or outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Swx4hm"&gt;For a single cam deal, you can get the $150 price point at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDEcZGyjH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-indoor-outdoor-cam-battery%2F-%2FA-82685730%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dindoor%2Doutdoor%2Dwireless%2Dcamera&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1657274-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01317_us.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ex7aC"&gt;One of our favorite gaming laptops, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUwzwuYGlu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for its lowest price ever at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. And this is the model to get, as it features an RTX 3070 graphics chip, 1TB of NVMe SSD storage, and 16GB of RAM. Topping it all off, the laptop is powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor, and it has a 1440p display with a 165Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SXPPe"&gt;This deal knocks $300 off the regular price, dropping it down to just $1,550, which is actually the same price that Asus is asking for its lesser 14-inch G14 laptop that has an RTX 3060. Our reviewer Monica Chin was impressed by the G15’s ability to compress such impressive performance into a lightweight and portable package. If this wasn’t sweet enough, this laptop also comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiZoG2"&gt;Overall, we consider the Zephyrus G15 to be an excellent laptop, with the lack of a webcam being one of the few caveats to this otherwise impressive piece of hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This deal gets even better since you can send in a mail-in rebate to get an extra $100 off for a final cost of $1,800. This laptop is one of a handful of models that comes equipped with an RTX 3080 graphics card for peak mobile gaming performance, and the inclusion of HDMI and Mini Display Port inputs allows you to project to multiple displays. In addition to its powerful graphics card, the GP66 also features 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YIWEtE"&gt;If you missed out on the promotion last weekend, you can still cash in on this discounted subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at Eneba. Regularly $45, you can &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;ued=https://www.eneba.com/us/xbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global/best-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a three-month subscription for $25&lt;/a&gt; with the code &lt;strong&gt;90DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.

&lt;div id="AmXTPy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkJRdp"&gt;Our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, the Sony WH-1000XM4s, are still available for their lowest price yet at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUBu6Dwsda" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $350, this deal brings these cans down to just $248. Besides providing industry-leading noise cancellation, our reviewer Chris Welch particularly liked the improved voice quality and the addition of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. These over-ear headphones are able to last up to 30 hours on a single charge and provide a comfortable listening experience with plush ear pads. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GmiLX1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LcY3hz"&gt;The Apple-centric Powerbeats Pro earbuds are currently enjoying a discount of $100, bringing them down to just $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTR418/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpowerbeats-pro-wireless-earphones-black%2F-%2FA-54610898&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Designed foremost for working out, these earbuds are sweat and water resistant, and they feature an ear hook design to keep them firmly planted in your ears while on a jog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0WgBx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was impressed by the “epic” battery life of these earbuds, which can last up to 24 hours with its almost comically large charging case. It dwarfs the AirPods case by comparison, but similarly relies on a Lightning cable to top it off between uses. These are mild inconveniences, though, for a pair of earbuds that punch well above their weight in terms of sound quality and remain comfortably planted in your ears, even during more intense activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8yWESy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmVuaK"&gt;If you need a portable drive to tote around projects and files, this ruggedized 1TB model from SanDisk is available for its lowest price ever at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727920735101244007" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GTYFC37/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model of the SanDisk Extreme increases the read speed to 1050MB/s and the write speed to 1000MB/s with its USB-C interface, but also comes packaged with a USB-A adapter to make it compatible with a wide variety of devices. The integrated loop makes it easy to clip this external hard drive to the inside of a backpack or camera bag, and the IP55 dust and water resistance keeps the drive protected from the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZv88J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10257048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OqXZ28"&gt;Yeah, gaming keyboards are cool, but what about ergonomics? The Microsoft Sculpt keyboard combo typically hovers around $100 but is currently available for $80 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUybZYyYRs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Wireless-Desktop-Keyboard/dp/B00CYX54C0/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This bundle includes the wrist-friendly Sculpt keyboard that features a split layout and a number of adjustment options to accommodate a variety of desk layouts. The bundle also comes with a wireless number pad, a welcome addition for anyone who lives in spreadsheets. Finally, the bundle includes a rounded mouse that meets somewhere between conventional mouse designs and vertical, ergonomically friendly models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RN6CPM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318484"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MVACov"&gt;Other deals you might be interested in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3PPWvZ"&gt;Grab the physical version of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz27GPpee" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; for Xbox or PlayStation for $15&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy. This game typically retails for $60, but this is the best deal we’ve seen on the latest installment of Ubisoft’s &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/em&gt; franchise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E4otbq"&gt;If you’re tired of having a boring mouse, you can grab any of the lively mice of the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUyZGGzjR4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech design collection for just $10 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, knocking $8 off the usual price tag. This model is available in five different designs that definitely make a statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ds8jAR"&gt;The uniquely curvaceous Microsoft Arc mouse is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUAaMZ2Ml0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $40 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Regularly $80, this bendable, Bluetooth mouse is handy because its ability to lay flat allows it to be stashed just about anywhere. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YcjHTe"&gt;This Samsonite Leather Backpack for 15-inch laptops is down to its lowest price ever. This classy and durable bag normally costs $190 but is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz8lCgigW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently down to just $146 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s new mobile homescreen makes it easier to jump back to pages you’ve recently visited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOfPYJofQ88gskq3TZNmGEujYlg=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078678/Untitled_1.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of Firefox’s new mobile homescreen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mozilla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qJN2fq"&gt;Mozilla is updating the homescreen on its Firefox mobile apps to help you more easily jump back to pages you had viewed recently. With Firefox 94, which will be available Tuesday, you’ll be able to see things like your last open tab, recently-viewed bookmarks, and recent searches grouped by topic right on the mobile homescreen. You can get an idea of what it looks like in this image from Mozilla:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h47cQnpUGKcDqk8EmInS14Oab8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977842/Untitled.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Firefox mobile homescreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKQcuX"&gt;Firefox 94 is also giving Android users the ability to tailor Pocket recommendations that show up on the homescreen by selecting different story topics they are interested in. According to a screenshot shared by Mozilla, topics include things like technology, health, food, and science. This feature isn’t yet available for iOS users, Mozilla says, though they will still see be able to see Pocket recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kGLzqcdmX5hla10YQ1a6LONgdR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979055/Untitled.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are some of the Pocket story topics you can pick from.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B5ToY8"&gt;The desktop version of Firefox 94 brings some updates, too, including 18 new themes you can use to customize the way the browser looks for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music launches its first true podcasts feature: synced transcripts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/76_keOrT5rsVppsNHnySK6aWVXU=/0x0:1912x1275/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078658/PR_browsescreens.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YvPcIW"&gt;Amazon Music first put podcasts on its platform last year, and now it’s launching its first feature built around them. The service plans to roll out automatically generated, synchronized transcripts on both iOS and Android in the US starting today, meaning the transcripts will match the audio you’re hearing, and you can toggle around them to jump to specific parts of the audio. The transcripts are interactive and can be viewed full-screen or on top of the album art within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx0yYt"&gt;For now, the transcripts are only coming to certain Amazon Music and Wondery shows, along with partner programs that have worked with Amazon on the feature, like &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Crime Junkie&lt;/em&gt;. (The third-party launch partners include American Public Media, Audiochuck, Cadence13, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, Stitcher, and TED.) More partners’ shows will receive transcripts in the future, says Kintan Brahmbhatt, director of podcasts at Amazon Music. The reason the team is being so hands-on with partners is that Amazon wants to be “one of the most creator-friendly, most podcaster-friendly, services out there,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P4Ml1q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Navigate podcasts through text&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vatfYJ"&gt;Ads won’t be transcribed — the transcription will just say “audio not transcribed” over those breaks. Broadly, Brahmbhatt says the key thing he and the team wanted to accomplish with this launch was being able to navigate a podcast based on the written version, similar to how someone can scrub through a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWEy82"&gt;“You’re listening to an interview and say, ‘Oh yeah, they made a really good point. I could have bookmarked it, but I just want to go back to that section again,’ — or revisiting a show or revisiting some aspect of the show; it really helps customers to go back and forth and use that as a navigation tool more so than just read along,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaAATV"&gt;Amazon Music is now both a music and podcast app, and it remains separate from Audible, which operates with a different payment model but also offers podcasts. Amazon Music has been pursuing various exclusive shows deals, including, most prominently, a deal with &lt;em&gt;SmartLess &lt;/em&gt;for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/amazon-acquires-smartless-podcast-for-as-much-as-80-million"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; between $60 and $80 million, which gave the service a weeklong exclusivity window. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549391/amazon-music-art19-hosting-platform-advertisers"&gt;also acquired&lt;/a&gt; hosting and monetization service Art19 and podcast network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, which operates its own subscription podcast app called Wondery Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIX9NW"&gt;As for Amazon’s competitors, Spotify has yet to widely roll out transcripts and is keeping them focused on select originals and exclusives. &lt;em&gt;The Bill Simmons Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, for example, offers automatically generated transcripts, while &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; does not. Spotify’s transcripts can be navigated in chunks, so you can’t tap on a word or phrase like you can in Amazon Music’s solution. Apple Podcasts doesn’t natively offer full transcripts, but show creators can transcribe shows themselves and include the written version in their show notes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tempo’s simplified smart home gym uses an iPhone to track your workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRYNWWXjUGvUSoa23FHjYe2vMOk=/0x1:5487x3659/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078626/Tempo_Move_Lifestyle_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dock an iPhone into the Tempo Move and it’ll output workouts to a connected TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tempo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oRjf2i"&gt;Tempo, the smart home gym that uses computer vision to track your workouts and offer guidance in real time, has gone on a diet. Today it’s launching the Tempo Move, a new home workout setup that ditches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction"&gt;the original’s&lt;/a&gt; 42-inch touchscreen with Microsoft’s Azure Kinect sensors built in, in favor of using existing TVs combined with the sensors built into the iPhone XS / XR and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZQMrI"&gt;It means that the Tempo Move’s setup is slimmed down compared to the original Tempo Studio, but there’s still a lot of hardware here. At the center is what Tempo’s calling the “Core,” which is effectively an iPhone dock that can connect to a TV via HDMI. The kit also comes with a storage unit containing “smart weights” including plates and dumbbells. With a suggested retail price of $495 plus a monthly subscription cost of $39, the Tempo Move is far from budget, but it’s a lot more affordable than the $2,495 Tempo charges for the &lt;a href="https://imp.i277339.net/c/482924/814975/11505?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftempo.fit%2Fshop%3Fpackage%3Dstarter&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tempo Studio Starter Package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpojpvPs4lGXPPgXWnndmk1hjvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978861/Tempo_Move_Product_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tempo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smart weights come with a cabinet in which to store them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DPORiX"&gt;“We’re at an inflection point now that iPhone models are able to run sophisticated AI locally and have precise depth-sensing technology,” says Tempo co-founder and CTO Josh Augustin. “Experiences that used to require expensive hardware can now be built on devices many of us already own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1Tg0g"&gt;The Tempo Move is designed to offer a similar range of exercises to the original Studio. You get “thousands” of live and on-demand workout classes covering everything from strength training to HIIT, yoga, and cardio. The system uses computer vision to track the smart weights and offer advice on form, track progress, and give workout recommendations. Tempo says that dumbbells are supported at launch, and support for barbells and kettlebell classes is coming next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7BEc4"&gt;Since the system relies on Apple’s TrueDepth camera tech in the iPhone XS / XR and newer (not including the iPhone SE), there’s no sign of Android support just yet. The company says it’s also working on adding support for the lidar sensors built into the iPhone 12 Pro and up in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m9OgJ"&gt;The Tempo Move is available starting today at an introductory price of $395. Tempo says the Move will ship in early December.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="13E5QB"&gt;Wow, November 2nd. Can you believe it’s Christmas already?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i78zxZ"&gt; In all seriousness, though, we do have a lot of presents for you today. Specifically: Three! exclusive! announcements! Also, if you don’t know me yet — hey! I’m Aria, Ashley’s Hot Pod sidekick. I publish mostly on Fridays for our Insider audience, which is another great reason to subscribe &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;over there&lt;/a&gt;. I’m in for Ashley today, as she traverses the depths of hell, aka moves across NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXybey"&gt;Now, guided by my trusting hand, let us go! To the news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GXMexM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wnmHEj"&gt;EXCLUSIVES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ncMl1e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC brings exclusive podcasts abroad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUZBpk"&gt;As of today, Apple has another big partner for its paid podcast channels: &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/channel/bbc-podcasts/id6442538935"&gt;BBC Studios&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike other subscription products, which mostly offer perks like ad-free listening for existing audiences, this channel will give US and Canadian listeners access to shows that were previously only playable in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aF4Cny"&gt;Here’s an example: The show &lt;em&gt;5 Minutes On&lt;/em&gt; already exists, but if you were to try to access the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0b1gbtl"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; from, say, your very American apartment in Philadelphia, you’d get an error message that says, “This content is not available in your location.” It also doesn’t show up on Spotify, Stitcher, etc. Through BBC Podcasts Premium on Apple Podcasts, paying Philadelphians (and Dallasites! and Montrealers!) will now be able to listen to &lt;em&gt;5 Minutes On&lt;/em&gt; and other shows like &lt;em&gt;Nuremberg: The Trial of the Nazi War Criminals&lt;/em&gt;, which stars Natalie Dormer from &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wgEq6"&gt; BBC Studios is calling these previously localized programs “exclusives,” and there will be more coming soon. I’m also told we should also keep our eyes peeled for similar expansions in other countries. As a reminder, Apple’s podcast subscriptions are &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-and-channels-are-now-available-worldwide/"&gt;enabled worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1o0X6j"&gt; Beyond these exclusives, BBC Podcasts Premium also offers ad-free versions of about a dozen other shows, which, as I said, is a common fixture of paid podcast channels… speaking of!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7jgNV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slate expands audio-subscription offerings to Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roC0bw"&gt;Also coming atcha this morning, Slate &lt;a href="http://apple.co/slate"&gt;launched its own&lt;/a&gt; Apple Podcasts Subscription. You could already pay for things like ad-free listening and bonus content through &lt;a href="https://slate.com/plus"&gt;Slate Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which was hosted directly on the publication’s site, and which also bundled in features that were relevant to its written content, like unlimited access to articles. Now, consumers have the option to pay solely for Slate’s audio, which notably includes the popular podcast &lt;em&gt;Slow Burn&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, I’m told that since the show has been such a big reason people have signed up for paid access before now, it was a no-brainer to launch the official Apple stream this week: &lt;em&gt;Slow Burn&lt;/em&gt;’s newest season comes out tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyRJxa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Music continues to make moves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyBCXM"&gt;Hi! It’s Ashley. I’m out today but had to deliver a little somethin’ for you all. Earlier today, I wrote about Amazon Music launching its first dedicated podcast feature: synchronized transcripts. You can read more about them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22516791"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the broad thing to know is this feature is launching with select Wondery and Amazon Music shows, as well as some third-party programs like &lt;em&gt;Crime Junkie&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt;. You can scrub through transcripts like you do a video, so the words match up to the audio you’re hearing and allow you to jump around. Ads won’t be transcribed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0spZ4j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fmPCVj"&gt;I have many thoughts on transcription, but namely want to know why this doesn’t exist in every app? Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441886/spotify-podcast-transcription-accessbility-app-update"&gt;announced transcripts&lt;/a&gt; for some of its shows earlier this year, but still, not every original or exclusive has them. Notably, Joe Rogan’s show has none, and I very much would appreciate being able to skim that show rather than committing hours. Obviously, transcripts should also be distributed for accessibility purposes. (Is this where I can rant about how wrong it is that many NYC subway stations don’t have elevators or escalators?)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYOzuI"&gt;Kintan Brahmbhatt, Amazon Music’s director of podcasts, also spoke with me about developing the platform and why Amazon hasn’t settled on a single release schedule for its shows. “We look at it as a 10-year story arc,” he said. “This is not like a one- or two-year ‘make a quick buck’ kind of thing for us. Amazon is in it for the very long term.” We’ll have more from the interview for Insiders on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy7eEP"&gt;Now back to Aria, with a couple other things of interest today. Podcasts are increasingly becoming part of the lexicon, and these developments really show it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XKPxwj"&gt;
&lt;p id="gXZcV3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A podcast on Broadway… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvAIrn"&gt;I poked around, just for you, to get more details about the recently announced &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/broadway-closing-the-distance-windows-tawni-odell-sheldon-epps-1234863307/"&gt;Broadway adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Closing the Distance&lt;/em&gt;, an audio drama that was produced and released during the pandemic. According to co-executive producer Valerie Smaldone, it will indeed be “the first and only Broadway play that began as an audio drama podcast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQsTME"&gt;We’re entering a whole new world of derivative works, my friends. Books have long &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0HgHet0sxg"&gt;become movies&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaACdx9PEGg"&gt;graffiti can inspire songs&lt;/a&gt;; now, it seems that podcasts have established themselves firmly enough to get adapted into not only TV series and live touring shows,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but full-on professional plays. For what it’s worth, this is no accident: derivative works are the goal of &lt;a href="https://www.audiodramainitiative.com/"&gt;The Audio Drama Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, the company that produced &lt;em&gt;Closing the Distance &lt;/em&gt;and has a larger slate of, you guessed it, audio dramas. “We gauge how they resonate with an audience, and then see what medium — film, theatre, episodics — might be best to develop,” says Smaldone. Until now, though, that theatre option has been markedly untapped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7OVbB"&gt;So who’s gonna go see it? And will you only go if Jason Alexander revives his audio role? Lmk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqBo55"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…. and in my TV time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jQDHi"&gt;While I was watching Hulu recently, I got an ad for Grammarly, the whole premise of which was that people were using the company’s editing services while launching a podcast. Here’s a screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y588woXc5HO__1hgVz2zShE1tyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978978/unnamed.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hzUL0r"&gt;It felt odd and new and noteworthy for podcasting to so casually grace my screen, but it seems likely that this kind of thing will only get more common. At the same time, maybe it’s a red herring? Hulu &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the maker of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fseries%2Fonly-murders-in-the-building-ef31c7e1-cd0f-4e07-848d-1cbfedb50ddf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22759039%2Fapple-subscription-podcast-partners-bbc-studios-slate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only Murders in the Building&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is about loving true-crime podcasts. Another possibility: maybe only certain people get served this particular Grammarly ad (e.g., people who report on the podcast industry). I imagine it’s tricky to target based on ~plot~ but at the same time, all of the Bed, Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ads I’ve seen recently have had queer couples, which I take to mean that I’m not only being watched — &lt;em&gt;I’m being seen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xeJHqv"&gt;
&lt;p id="p5RWTa"&gt; So pleased to be with y’all this morning — provided Ashley has a smooth move, she’ll be in your inboxes later this week! Take care ‘til then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSzHIA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UjEg2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom is testing showing ads to free users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/arPTbD_gjhIlDFEHBIYTv8btbok=/0x0:1152x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078550/ads_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AVPVmY"&gt;Zoom is piloting showing ads to users on its free “Basic” tier, the &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-continued-access-for-basic-users-with-advertising-program/"&gt;company has announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Ads will appear on the browser page shown to users at the end of a call. Zoom says ads are being rolled out to free users in “certain countries,” though its blog post doesn’t detail exactly which these are. Users on the service’s Basic tier will only see ads if they join a meeting hosted by another Basic tier user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csnvXi"&gt;Although ads won’t be shown during meetings themselves, it’s still a potentially big shift for the videoconferencing service. Zoom has typically imposed only minor restrictions on its free tier, which helped the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232401/zoom-300-million-users-growth-coronavirus-pandemic-security-privacy-concerns-response"&gt;explode in popularity last year&lt;/a&gt; as people around the world adapted to working and socializing from home. Even its end-to-end encryption, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279355/zoom-end-encryption-calls-fbi-police-free-users"&gt;Zoom initially said would be limited to paid users&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294355/zoom-security-end-to-end-encryptoin-beta-release-july-2020-new-feature"&gt;ended up coming to free users&lt;/a&gt; after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yxv3PV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This change ensures that our free Basic users are able to continue connecting with friends, family, and colleagues”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mrng5R"&gt;Until now, arguably the biggest restriction on Zoom’s free tier is its 40-minute limit on the length of group calls. But Zoom’s chief marketing officer Janine Pelosi writes that it needs to start showing ads to help it “support investment and continue providing free Basic users with access to our robust platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUHbMq"&gt;“This change ensures that our free Basic users are able to continue connecting with friends, family, and colleagues with the same robust platform we have always offered,” Pelosi writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjjVup"&gt;In the hopes of avoiding a similar privacy backlash to the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202584/zoom-security-privacy-issues-video-conferencing-software-coronavirus-demand-response"&gt;greeted the service’s surge in popularity last year&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom is emphasizing that it won’t be using “meeting, webinar, or messaging content (specifically, audio, video, files, and messages)” to target ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcRVOJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon lifts mask mandates for vaccinated warehouse employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DorCkQZ_w0aKiUmS-MTbCZvLBl4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076244/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYHYlj"&gt;Amazon is lifting its mask mandate for fully vaccinated warehouse workers in the US (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/amazon-lifts-mask-mandate-for-fully-vaccinated-warehouse-workers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company reportedly sent out a notice to operations employees, stating that vaccinated workers are no longer required to wear masks starting November 2nd. Masks will still be required if state or local laws mandate them, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifiLFn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon will continue to evaluate its COVID-19 safety measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkMh1d"&gt;“Vaccines are universally available across the US, and vaccination rates continue to rise, which enables the ability to return to our previous mask policy,” the notice reads (via &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;). An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company will be lifting its mask mandates for vaccinated employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcHx4W"&gt;“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our employees has been our number one priority. Starting Tuesday, November 2, fully vaccinated US field Operations employees will no longer be required to wear face coverings at work, unless otherwise mandated by federal, state, or local regulations,” an Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We continue to evaluate all of our temporary COVID-19 safety measures, making adjustments in alignment with public health authority guidance and our own medical experts to prioritize the health and safety of employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8COEp"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613542/amazon-warehouse-mask-mandate"&gt;Amazon reinstated its mask mandate policy&lt;/a&gt; for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees in response to an uptick in COVID-19 cases. This came shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/amazon-says-vaccinated-workers-can-ditch-masks-starting-next-week.html"&gt;Amazon stopped requiring facial coverings for vaccinated workers&lt;/a&gt; in May. It appears that Amazon is slowly relaxing its safety guidelines for workers as vaccines become available to nearly everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22734765/fda-covid-vaccine-5-11-year-old-approve"&gt;including children&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22584386/amazon-end-onsite-covid-19-testing-us-warehouses"&gt;discontinued its onsite COVID-19 testing&lt;/a&gt; in July, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;corporate workers will return to the office in early 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yrbRD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:30 AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added a statement from an Amazon spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook verified a fan page posing as Elon Musk, but now the page is gone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRZmeqltur1Y8BtOyqPo3Pp8F8A=/35x0:875x560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70075819/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.10.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fan page verified as Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aDcqSQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici"&gt;A Facebook fan page for Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; with 153,000 followers had been verified as the official page representing the Tesla Technoking — in violation of Facebook’s own rules — but sometime after we first published this story on Monday, the page became inaccessible. It’s unclear if Facebook took it down or the owners chose to make it unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs9FT9"&gt;To be clear, the page wasn’t&lt;em&gt; pretending&lt;/em&gt; it’s Musk; it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici/about_details"&gt;openly stated&lt;/a&gt; that it was a fan page in its About section (emphasis ours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XdKsQi"&gt;Musk owns a Tesla Roadster car 0001 (the first one off the production line) from Tesla Motors, a company in which he is an early investor. The Roadster is a battery electric sportscar with a 220 mile range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vNS90"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a fanpage, uploading tweets etc from him&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BALMNiWjSt8SNj0UUxMzIjP5DTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977005/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.10.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is the page’s description, which states it’s a fan page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IxROW"&gt;When we wrote about it, there were only 10 posts on the page, with the earliest dating from October 21st. One was a photo of Musk, one was a notification that the page updated its profile picture to be one featuring Musk, and the others appeared to be reposts of recent tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QSBPB"&gt;The page didn’t start as a fan page for Elon Musk. The &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici/about_profile_transparency"&gt;Page Transparency&lt;/a&gt; tab — which shows some history of a page, who it is managed by, and whether it runs ads — said the page was created on July 28th, 2019 to represent a “Kizito Gavin,” which is the reversed name of &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gavin+kizito&amp;amp;sxsrf=AOaemvLL_yUSow0dBngTpDo-xCxLByLbUQ:1635794566290&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN6LHQ8ffzAhUCIjQIHRKJDxMQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;amp;biw=1824&amp;amp;bih=860&amp;amp;dpr=1.58"&gt;soccer player Gavin Kizito&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67PMQq"&gt;The page changed its name six times, all in 2021, most recently changing to Elon Musk twice (somehow) on October 17th. The Page Transparency section also said that the people who managed the page were based in Egypt. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;Musk lives in Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sVtwWgPbGruz8ne3XvUQc-eb9Z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977015/Screen_Shot_2021_11_01_at_11.36.04_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The page started as one for Kizito Gavin, but now apparently is the official one for Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zrsxSh"&gt;Also maybe worth noting: the URL for the page cut off the end of the word “official” — &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ElonMuskoffici&lt;/a&gt; — which doesn’t seem very official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoUEq5"&gt;It’s unclear when the page was verified. Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1288173394636262"&gt;verification rules&lt;/a&gt; state that the company has “confirmed that the Page or profile is the authentic presence of the public figure or brand it represents.” To be verified on Facebook, you have to fill out &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/295038365360854"&gt;a form&lt;/a&gt; that requires, among other things, that the submitter share official identification in the form of a driver’s license, passport, national identification card, tax filing, recent utility bill, or articles of incorporation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OupVAn"&gt;Verification is a challenge for big social media platforms. Twitter has also struggled with the problem. It paused its verification program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and relaunched it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The relaunch has been somewhat bumpy, though, and the company admitted in July that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;it mistakenly verified&lt;/a&gt; a small number of fake accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYbQuG"&gt;Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, hasn’t replied to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zillow reportedly needs to sell 7,000 houses after it bought too many</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ODl9et"&gt;Zillow is trying to offload around $2.8 billion worth of houses onto investors after it bought them with the intent of selling them to hopeful homeowners and landlords, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This follows &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/zillow-s-flipping-snag-spotlights-risk-in-cooling-housing-market?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;another &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that the real estate browsing website had to stop buying houses when it found itself with excess inventory after the company told investors it planned on ramping up its flipping business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKPG4A"&gt;Some readers may be surprised that Zillow buys and sells houses, rather than just acting as a place for real estate agents to post listings — I was too when I first heard about it, but the company has actually been doing this for years through &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/offers/"&gt;its Zillow Offers program&lt;/a&gt;. According to its site, the idea is that Zillow will buy your house in cash, streamlining the process significantly. It’ll then deal with any repairs or quick renovations and then sell the house itself. It’s not the only one with this business model either — competing real estate site Redfin has a similar program, and there are entire companies dedicated to internet-based home-buying, like OpenDoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PhbSLH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zillow was in an “arms race” to scoop up houses throughout the summer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbmscU"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ymxz/zillow-other-tech-firms-are-in-an-arms-race-to-buy-up-american-homes"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; article detailed&lt;/a&gt; what it described as an “arms race” among tech companies that were trying to buy up as much real estate as possible as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/9/16/22674410/housing-crisis-homelessness-poll"&gt;housing prices exploded across the country&lt;/a&gt;. According to the report, Zillow bet big, telling investors that it planned to buy thousands of houses throughout 2021 and turn its Homes division into a billion-dollar business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syrXK4"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;staggeringly hot summer&lt;/a&gt; came to an end, though, it seemed like Zillow’s Offers business was also cooling down — in October, &lt;a href="https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/At-Operational-Capacity-Zillow-Offers-to-Focus-on-Signed-Customer-Contracts-and-Current-Inventory-Suspends-Signing-of-New-Contracts-Through-2021/default.aspx"&gt;the company told investors&lt;/a&gt; that it would stop buying houses, citing construction, renovation, and closing labor shortages. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, however, speculated that it &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/zillow-s-flipping-snag-spotlights-risk-in-cooling-housing-market?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;could also be motivated by excess inventory&lt;/a&gt; and reported that Zillow seemed to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-26/zillow-s-zeal-to-outbid-for-homes-backfires-in-flipping-fumble?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;sell a good number of houses at a loss&lt;/a&gt; instead of a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTwoMQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The housing market has been on a wild ride, and it’s probably not Zillow’s fault&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C180e2"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Zillow is looking to offload around 7,000 of the homes it bought. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like individual house hunters will be able to benefit from Zillow’s troubles — &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the company is trying to sell the homes to “institutional investors” (read: Wall Street-like firms) to the tune of $2.8 billion. To would-be homebuyers who have been turned down due to a seemingly endless supply of cash buyers, it &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22524829/wall-street-housing-market-blackrock-bubble"&gt;may feel like a slap in the face&lt;/a&gt;. However, it doesn’t seem like the housing market’s wild ride is entirely due to investment bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hheedq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22524829/wall-street-housing-market-blackrock-bubble"&gt;A report from &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cites research that investors only made up about 20 percent of the home-buying market in 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-ibuyer-report-q2-2021-30011/"&gt;Zillow says that it&lt;/a&gt; and its competitors made up around 1 percent of the housing market in Q2 2021. In some ways, those numbers are both terrifying and reassuring — a fifth of the housing market is a massive and influential chunk, but it also means that it likely wasn’t a private equity firm (or Zillow) that outbid you on your dream home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BLq9I"&gt;It’s hard to tell what will come of this sale and how it’ll affect Zillow’s home flipping plans in the future. However, it probably won’t stop &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22743258/home-buying-zillow-redfin-ibuyers-real-estate"&gt;the conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; that Zillow is driving up prices on purpose, and if I’m any indication, it won’t make home hopefuls feel any better about their chances of scoring a place to live. Perhaps it’s just another data point for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks"&gt;the argument that finances are a meme now&lt;/a&gt; and that betting big doesn’t mean you’re going to get what you’re hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
