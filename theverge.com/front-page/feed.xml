    <title>Adidas and Xbox teamed up on one more console-themed sneaker, which is on sale now for $140</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adidas Forum Tech Boost Series X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pBk5Zlmby3muyAfCVx3tA31ISw=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70302376/Xbox_ForumTechBoost_Media_01_JPG_1200.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="kKkRY8"&gt;Adidas and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712418/adidas-xbox-sneakers-trainers-microsoft"&gt;have collaborated on three different pairs of shoes&lt;/a&gt; this year to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Xbox, and now the final shoe from that partnership has been officially revealed. Unlike the previous releases, these &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/12/21/xbox-series-x-adidas-sneaker/"&gt;Forum Tech Boost Series X&lt;/a&gt; shoes are available for purchase globally, going on sale from Adidas and other retailers, and are currently in stock on &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2FMicrosoft.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt; for $140.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSqLfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox in secret style ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22785059/microsoft-halo-xbox-translucent-controller-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2PtdO"&gt;The overall design and coloring are in place to mimic Microsoft’s latest flagship console, with black netting and a green liner inside that’s similar to the Xbox Series X’s fan vent, and a sphere Xbox logo on the side is drawn from the Elite controller.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9sz6A"&gt;Like other Tech Boost colorways, the Xbox edition shoes feature a translucent sole, which Microsoft says is a reference to the also-translucent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date"&gt;20th Anniversary Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt; it just released. Even if you don’t indulge in a mini-fridge, Xbox-branded Adidas, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798429/xbox-museum-20th-anniversary-stats-achievements"&gt;a stroll through your own personal history with Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, you may want to carve out some time to watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0il2l-B_WwadxfTkK3-NLoYNcQEHdBGO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On: The Story of Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a surprisingly thorough look back at two decades of gaming efforts from Microsoft that is streaming for free on YouTube and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DuckDuckGo is working on a privacy-focused desktop browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kinLyf0NrUpxgK6N4Szhwv3sU4k=/46x0:1396x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301901/duckduckgo_desktop_app.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by DuckDuckGo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DIJYl7"&gt;DuckDuckGo, the company best known for its privacy-focused search engine of the same name, is working on a desktop browser that should bring the same focus on avoiding being tracked to your entire web experience. In a &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-2021-review/"&gt;post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg offers a glimpse at what the upcoming browser will look like and notes that we can expect it to perform the same way its browsing app does on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0p07E"&gt;Weinberg explains that the desktop browser will offer “robust privacy protection” by default, without you having to toggle on any hidden security settings. Like the mobile app, the desktop equivalent will come with the same “Fire” button that instantly erases all of your browsing history, stored data, and tabs in one click. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6pDWG"&gt;It’s also built around “OS-provided rendering engines” — like it is on mobile — which Weinberg says will create a neater interface and get rid of any clutter that comes with mainstream browsers. Weinberg also claims that early tests of the browser indicate that it’s “significantly faster” than Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Qj11x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're working on it!&lt;/p&gt;— Gabriel Weinberg (@yegg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1473298153424179205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L48v2o"&gt;The browser is currently in a closed beta test on macOS, but a tweet from Weinberg hints that DuckDuckGo is getting it ready for Windows as well. There’s no word on when the desktop browser will become publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XVpdN"&gt;Last month, DuckDuckGo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/20/22793068/duckduckgo-tool-prevent-apps-tracking-android-users"&gt;introduced a built-in tool for its mobile browsing app&lt;/a&gt; that’s supposed to prevent apps from tracking users on Android. And in July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22576352/duckduckgo-email-protection-privacy-trackers-apple-alternative"&gt;the company rolled out an email protection service&lt;/a&gt; that says it will strip away any trackers attached to your emails.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix Resurrections is more interested in being self-aware than being good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Matrix Resurrections" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uMN_VYrj9yMjSlX7cVccmjHX1TE=/230x0:1906x1117/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301899/rev_1_MX4_TRLR_013rv2_High_Res_JPEG.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A fantastic setup to a tepid sequel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vGznUC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; warned me its existence was a bad idea, and I kept watching anyway. I really have nobody but myself to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfUafS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; is, to its credit, a fairly weird film — but one that’s often more concerned with being self-aware than being good or enjoyable. Directed by Lana Wachowski instead of the typical Wachowski-sister duo, &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; starts with an intriguing bit of metatextual loopiness before devolving into a tepid sequel. It’s a gratingly uncool and reactive cut-up of an effortlessly cool and timeless work, albeit seemingly deliberately so. It seeks to dissect the adulation and mythos that have grown up around &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; over 22 years but without the masterful craftwork that inspired that adulation in the first place. And worst of all, the kung fu isn’t very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeLbxs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; is a direct sequel to 2003’s &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;, continuing the story of Neo, Trinity, and a few other well-known characters from the &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; trilogy. (If you don’t know who these people are or you haven’t thought about them much since then, I would strongly recommend brushing up.) But in spirit, it’s a sequel to the entire &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; cultural phenomenon that began in 1999. And without getting into specifics, I don’t mean this in some abstract thematic way. &lt;em&gt;Resurrections’&lt;/em&gt; narrative is very directly responding to decades of people analyzing everything from &lt;em&gt;The Matrix’s&lt;/em&gt; bullet time sequences to its &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-53692435"&gt;transgender subtext&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="JziFCD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nNpvWBuTfrc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="asTGsO"&gt;It’s a promising premise for a new installment in the series, and the early execution is fantastic. &lt;em&gt;Resurrections’&lt;/em&gt; opening calls back to an iconic &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; scene while stylishly introducing new characters and teasing a compellingly trippy plot, complete with a new palette that spices up the series’ classic monochrome with patches of slick color. It’s followed by an effectively cringeworthy sendup of a specific media industry that will remain nameless. It echoes &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;contemporary &lt;em&gt;The Thirteenth Floor&lt;/em&gt; — as well as its predecessor, the Rainer Fassbinder film &lt;em&gt;World On A Wire&lt;/em&gt; — with a story about losing track of the line between reality and fantasy but freshly made for a world where that philosophical dilemma has permeated pop culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XS2iBv"&gt;If you want to know as few plot points as possible about &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections,&lt;/em&gt; you can skip this paragraph. But if a little context is helpful, the film begins with Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie Anne-Moss) having been reinserted into a version of the Matrix simulation. The pair don’t know each other and have no memory of their earlier selves, and the former has achieved lonely fame inside the simulation while the latter has a family and a quiet life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7vCO0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Keanu Reeves’ rubber duck is just as good in context&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr0OhZ"&gt;Reeves is a lot of fun to watch in the film’s first act, where he’s playing a world-weary man who’s sick of being lauded as a visionary for creating something he now finds fundamentally silly even as it nearly ruined his life. (A shot of him lying in a bathtub with a rubber duck on his head is as good in context as it was in the film’s trailer.) Moss gets to try out a less austere and more human version of Trinity, and her story touches on interesting questions about what attachment means inside a virtual world. The original &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; was about a young, alienated loner, but &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; takes more seriously the idea that you could find meaning with other people in an activity that remains essentially fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpTjWe"&gt;From the beginning, though, the writing often feels disposable. Where &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; yearned to talk about big ideas like free will and the nature of reality, &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; is a series of burns on techbros, obsessive fans, the media industry, people who think quoting movies makes them cool, and other lesser contemporary villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix Resurrections" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExWKmAtakvYQ6KnUiVajds0cYPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115219/rev_1_MX4_FP_0130_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xi9J3q"&gt;The original film was obviously also a product of its time, riffing on tropes about corporate cubicle workers, virtual reality utopianism, and 20th-century ennui. But it used these specifics as the building blocks for a world that was self-contained and compelling even after the underlying cultural moment passed. In &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, these elements are tangential commentary that never anchors itself in a larger plot — particularly because when that larger plot &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; barge in, it’s flat at best and vicariously embarrassing at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sA0mjV"&gt;Like the original &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; eventually revolves around questions about Neo being “the One,” a figure with the power to control the Matrix. But unlike those films, &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t establish why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ourti7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Resurrections centers Neo and Trinity’s love story but in a disjointed and frustrating way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5dmZpI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; set its stakes high by painting a nightmarish future where humanity was perpetually at the brink of total enslavement, and its few free members lived a life of constant fear, and the One was a weapon that resistance fighters had spent their whole lives searching for. Its oft-maligned sequels eased up on this grimness, but in exchange, the films introduced characters with homes and families and orgiastic dance parties — most of them cared about Neo, not because of some idol-like affection, but because he might save those things. (The key exception, a figure introduced in &lt;em&gt;The Animatrix&lt;/em&gt; dubbed “The Kid,” had his hero-worship played as a poignant joke.) Even a character like Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus, who built his life around finding and protecting Neo, was motivated as much by the concept of faith as a personal attachment to the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOkOIS"&gt;There’s none of this in &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;. For one thing, the film barely bothers explaining what happened as a result of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Revolutions’ &lt;/em&gt;ending, when Neo’s powers finally helped him broker peace between humans and machines. Far from ignoring the sequels, it directly incorporates footage from them and features some returning characters. But it also quietly reverses large parts of them for no satisfying reason, making the import of everything Neo and Trinity did in those films unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bImZYZ"&gt;For another, the film’s new characters have virtually no motivations outside a fandom-like obsession with Neo. The heroes, who are functionally almost interchangeable except for the blue-haired Matrix escapee Bugs (Jessica Henwick), think he’s an awesome guy and want — as a literal stated mission — to help him get his “mojo” back. The villains are obsessed with tormenting him for underexplored reasons, even when that gets in the way of their theoretical actual job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Jessica Henwick as Bugs in The Matrix Resurrections" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjWzNRBrqI27hTQLijNUBxdBH3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115229/rev_1_MX4_FP_0050_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BIgBLx"&gt;Meanwhile, Neo himself has no interest in anything except rekindling his relationship with Trinity. The &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; films made the love story between the two an ever-larger part of the narrative as the trilogy progressed, and it’s obviously what Wachowski wants to focus on here. But it’s written in a way that makes Neo come off as either selectively amnesiac or chillingly unconcerned about the fate of the human race. His incuriosity about anything except Trinity also wastes opportunities to help explain foundational plot points, which instead get brought up and almost immediately abandoned. And the pair’s interactions, despite being the supposed heart of the film, are oddly disjointed. Wachowski has &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; read all those essays about &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11433378/heroes-female-sidekicks"&gt;Trinity Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, but Trinity’s character arc is still patchy and weak — full of moments that describe the existence of conflicts instead of letting them unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIvWFd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix’s&lt;/em&gt; sequels had countless flaws, but they showcased the Wachowski sisters’ straightforward knack for visually memorable set pieces and elaborate choreography. &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; has only one sequence that even approaches the fun of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded’s&lt;/em&gt; sprawling car chase or &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Revolution’s&lt;/em&gt; giant mech battle, and it’s over far too quickly. It barely tries to capture the magic of the original &lt;em&gt;Matrix’s&lt;/em&gt; gunplay and wire-fu, either. Its fight scenes draw more strongly from the post-&lt;em&gt;Bourne Identity&lt;/em&gt; school of choppy pragmatic combat, and they become progressively more perfunctory, more pointlessly derivative, and harder to follow thanks to a penchant for crowd scenes involving the film’s equivalent of zombies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTRSuM"&gt;But most frustratingly of all, &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; seems dedicated to shooting itself in the foot — and distinctly not dodging the bullet — with &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; callbacks that undercut its own strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Morpheus in The Matrix Resurrections" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMbYcMhMxdKpOHuZK2LlfW8GWow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115226/rev_1_MX4_31141r_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YO5k97"&gt;In a couple of casting decisions that are technically spoilers but have been confirmed online already, the film introduces &lt;em&gt;Watchmen’s&lt;/em&gt; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as a new iteration of Morpheus and &lt;em&gt;Mindhunter’s&lt;/em&gt; Jonathan Groff as a new version of the villain Agent Smith. It suits the film’s stated theme of evolution and repetition in theory, but in practice, it puts both men in the position of rehashing past iconic performances — in Abdul-Mateen’s case, from one of the most powerfully charismatic actors in Hollywood. He ends up playing little more than a collection of glib quips in an admittedly great suit, while Groff gets his shot at a uniquely hateable performance smothered by intercuts to Smith’s original actor Hugo Weaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OS13nz"&gt;There’s no good reason to do this. Narrative continuity doesn’t demand either man appear: Smith’s destruction was a central element of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;, and Morpheus was &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyvqqa/is-morpheus-not-in-the-matrix-trailer-because-he-died-in-the-matrix-mmo"&gt;canonically murdered in a video game by flies&lt;/a&gt;. Both roles could have been more compellingly written as original characters. The film runs in too many directions for the reincarnated Smith and Morpheus to spend time grappling with their evolution, they retain almost none of their original motivations, and Neo is too busy worrying about Trinity to engage with either. (The fact that Fishburne and Reeves had by far the most chemistry and the best-shared arc of any two &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; cast members makes this doubly sad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue6p5X"&gt;Smith’s presence is particularly unnecessary because he’s not even the primary antagonist. That dubious honor goes to a new character who’s written like a chatbot trained on the comments in a “high-IQ rationalist skeptics” subreddit, except that this description at least implies some kind of explanation for why he would exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tnwR89"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The film’s recast roles feel like an act of cynicism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HP4ATo"&gt;Instead, the recasting feels like an act of frustrated cynicism, the logical conclusion of Marvel-style storytelling where viewers can only care about a new character if they’re a reincarnation of an old one. Given the explicit narrative of the film, I’d even believe the awkwardness of it is intentional. &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; spends its entire first act telling audiences that a new &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; installment would be a hollow byproduct of corporate coercion dressed up as an innovative reworking of a classic. Like almost any recent major franchise film or game that supposedly “deconstructs” its predecessors, it’s given the freedom to posture at subversion before delivering the exact thing it’s required to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RVScPV"&gt;As someone who was shaped deeply by &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a little sad to walk away from &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; with the impression that fandom and franchise-based media have soured its legacy badly for Wachowski. I was a tween when it premiered, and it’s the first film I can remember processing as a kind of overwhelming aesthetic experience instead of a story that happened to involve moving pictures. Watching it decades later, it’s a perfect gestalt of memorable dialog, alluring conspiracism, kinetic camera work, and stylish violence. &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; is more than ripe for a self-aware joke — but not one built for a machine that won’t allow it the decency of a punchline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME7VMy"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; will premiere December 22nd in theaters and on HBO Max. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Merry Christmas: The Boston Dynamics dog has learned how to be Solid Snake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhpLO_Jks_8y2SEUhYGTHpOMslk=/289x0:1918x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301835/Screen_Shot_2021_12_21_at_11.25.12.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s been spotted.&lt;/em&gt; | Original image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pt8TmU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;Hyundai-owned&lt;/a&gt; Boston Dynamics has released a holiday video featuring its dog-like Spot robot, and it’s turned out as creepy as ever. The video, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1473316634840506383"&gt;posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, starts innocuously enough — there’s a large present of the type anyone would be happy to see under their tree, sitting in a courtyard. Then, the gift stands up and walks off-screen, kind of like &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear’s&lt;/em&gt; Solid Snake moving through a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbL_-aEu66M"&gt;jungle disguised as a cardboard box&lt;/a&gt; to stalk a private military contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJXPar"&gt;While the video ends with a “Happy Holidays” greeting, it’s perhaps not as heartwarming as it was meant to be. It’s hard to come away from it without the feeling that Spot’s going off on a mission to terrify a child or pull a prank on someone who thought they were about to get something really cool for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DT6nL4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy holidays and many thanks to everyone who helped drive Spot's success this year! We're excited to see where you can take our robots in 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wnIZKAuhbF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wnIZKAuhbF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boston Dynamics (@BostonDynamics) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1473316634840506383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvWYxx"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555535/bts-k-pop-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dancing-hyundai"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; videos (which themselves are a terrifying display of how the robots could definitely steal my girl by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/29/22205055/boston-dynamics-robots-spot-atlas-handle-dancing-video"&gt;being smoother and more coordinated&lt;/a&gt;), this video really leans into the creepy militaristic undertones of Boston Dynamic’s robots. I mean, the hiding under a box meme is from the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear &lt;/em&gt;franchise, which bills itself as “tactical espionage action” and has plot points about sinister AIs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqs4Ld"&gt;In real life, people have spotted the robots in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;military tests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;working for the NYPD&lt;/a&gt;. (Though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409559/nypd-robot-dog-digidog-boston-dynamics-contract-terminated"&gt;the NYPD contract was canceled&lt;/a&gt; after almost everyone said, “Wait, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; the police have a robot dog?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="skJj7P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Check under you tree for hidden robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQjTZv"&gt;What I’m saying is that this video is probably not going to win Spot any friends and isn’t getting me in the holiday spirit. Mostly it just makes me feel resigned to this being life now — a robot could be hiding under my tree, waiting to ambush me and ruining all the excitement I felt about The Big Present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdgUDT"&gt;Thankfully, we probably won’t have to start checking underneath every box for a robot like people in the southwest US check their shoes for scorpions. Spot’s sensors aren’t likely to do it much good through a cardboard barrier, and it’ll have a hard time sending a video feed to its remote control. Of course, someone close by could control it by eye to follow you, but if someone’s willing to do that, you’ve probably got bigger concerns than lifting up a box and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P5qbcRAXVk"&gt;hearing the “!” sound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GeForce Now upgraded to support 120fps gaming on Pixel 6 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcwVU6VqMbIbyooz2hIGdfkWEM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301692/akrales_211020_4802_0534.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The recently released Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="db3XwD"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro owners just got another reason to give Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud game streaming service a shot. The service can now stream games at 120fps on Google’s latest flagship smartphone, according to a recently updated support page &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/geforce-now-rtx-3080-tier-120fps-streaming-support-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear when the update rolled out exactly, but it means games should feel smoother and more responsive to play compared to when they were capped at 60fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMtHcU"&gt;That makes Google’s phone the first non-Samsung smartphone to support 120fps. According to &lt;a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5227"&gt;Nvidia’s help page&lt;/a&gt;, the feature has previously been available for Samsung’s S21 lineup, as well as its S20 FE and Note 20 phones. You’ll need to pay for GeForce Now’s top-of-the-line RTX 3080 tier to stream games at this higher framerate, which costs $99.99 for six months of service. That’s not exactly cheap, but it’s still more affordable than actually tracking down one of the graphics cards for yourself, and as of last week, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22838807/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-preorder-waitlist-gone"&gt;no waitlist to sign up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EDeTRz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;120fps streaming is also available on PC and Mac&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="65DFzR"&gt;On Android, GeForce Now is limited to 1080p streaming, which is, unfortunately, lower than the native resolution of the Pixel 6 Pro’s 1440p screen. If you want 1440p streaming at 120fps, then you’ll need to stream to a PC or Mac, while jumping up to 4K 60fps HDR streaming requires an Nvidia Shield TV. 1080p streaming also requires 25mbps of bandwidth, and Nvidia recommends connecting to a 5GHz wireless router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Zax16"&gt;It’s a neat little upgrade for Nvidia’s game streaming service, which allows you to play some (but not all) of your existing games bought on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft Connect / Uplay. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;already been impressed&lt;/a&gt; with what it’s capable of, and updates like these hardly hurt. Hopefully, 4K support on non-Nvidia hardware isn’t far behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjhSC2"&gt;If you have a GeForce Now RTX 3080 subscription and you’re using a Pixel 6 Pro, you can manually enable the higher framerate from the Stream quality menu in the GeForce Now app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola agrees to pay $125 million to settle allegations it defrauded investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gc8RyhRDaZEFSg1kccGeVI3xtEA=/295x0:2455x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301464/nikola_one_16.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nikola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iJ9EmD"&gt;Hydrogen trucking startup Nikola Corp. agreed to pay $125 million to settle charges that it defrauded investors by misleading them about its products and technical achievements, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExJrVZ"&gt;The SEC accused Nikola of violating US securities law with numerous misleading statements made in 2020 about the company’s products and its future financial prospects. The company’s founder and former CEO, Trevor Milton, was arrested earlier this year on charges that he falsely portrayed Nikola as close to releasing a functional product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIffY9"&gt;“As the order finds, Nikola Corporation is responsible both for Milton’s allegedly misleading statements and for other alleged deceptions, all of which falsely portrayed the true state of the company’s business and technology,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-267"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This misconduct — and the harm it inflicted on retail investors — merits the strong remedies today’s settlement provides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HWI0hJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nikola Corporation is responsible both for Milton’s allegedly misleading statements and for other alleged deceptions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0lZTVm"&gt;The amount will be paid in five installments over two years, the first of which is due at the end of 2021. The company went public in 2020 after merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrSr1z"&gt;“We are pleased to bring this chapter to a close as the company has now resolved all government investigations,” the company said in a statement. Earlier this month, Nikola announced that it had delivered its first two vehicles to a customer operating at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWqBQh"&gt;Unlike his company, Milton doesn’t appear interested in settling. This week, he filed several motions requesting the judge throw out his case, arguing that he wasn’t given fair notice that his statements could be considered criminal or would influence stock sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cOQ3m6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are pleased to bring this chapter to a close”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgkNe7"&gt;Founded in 2015, Nikola staked out a unique position in the buzzy EV space by claiming it would make zero-emission big rigs using hydrogen fuel cell technology. But the last two years have been especially tumultuous for the company. In November 2020, General Motors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427009/gm-nikola-acquisition-electric-hydrogen-truck"&gt;put the startup on the map&lt;/a&gt; by announcing plans to acquire an 11 percent equity stake. The automaker also said it would help Nikola engineer and manufacture its battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131754/nikola-badger-hydrogen-electric-pickup-truck-specs-photos-battery-range"&gt;the Badger pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiOOs9"&gt;But less than a week later, short-selling firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck"&gt;published a bombshell report&lt;/a&gt; accusing Nikola of fraud, including staging a video that showed one of its trucks cruising down a hill. The report set off a chain reaction that resulted in Milton stepping down as board chairman and CEO and eventually his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOi3Rl"&gt;So far, Milton’s defense has focused on picking apart the prosecution’s charges that he defrauded investors, arguing that most of his statements were made before the company went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5aoio"&gt;According to filings &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/nikola-s-milton-seeks-to-dismiss-two-counts-of-indictment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;cited by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Milton is accusing the government of focusing on “tweets, social media posts, podcasts, and television or print interviews — many of which were made or conducted long before Nikola was a public company — in an attempt to criminalize promotional speech about Nikola’s products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIl9sw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhP5h7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden plan will send out 500 million coronavirus tests to try to tackle the omicron surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Meets With Covid-19 Response Team" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lQ1velWmzYZLyNurU8cFMRoXe_Q=/0x0:7421x4947/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301413/1237275803.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;President Biden will announce a plan to send 500 million free coronavirus test kits to Americans | Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmeZ7V"&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/21/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-americans-and-help-communities-and-hospitals-battle-omicron/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; President Biden will deliver a speech Tuesday to announce a plan to distribute 500 million free at-home rapid COVID-19 tests beginning next month, as the administration ramps up attempts to deal with the spread of the omicron variant. The administration says it will set up a website for Americans who want to request a test to be delivered to their homes for free. This would be the second public-facing pandemic-specific website from the Biden administration, which previously built a &lt;a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/"&gt;site to direct people to vaccine providers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dan24"&gt;The president’s so-called “winter plan” will also send 1,000 medical military members — including doctors, nurses, and other personnel — to hospitals overwhelmed with COVID patients and will set up more free federal testing sites. And the administration says it will deploy hundreds of federal “vaccinators” across 12 states, Tribes, and territories to help “enable thousands of additional appointments over the next few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnwO8M"&gt;The actions come as the number of new coronavirus cases has exploded due in large part to omicron, a highly infectious variant of the virus; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;omicron is now the dominant strain&lt;/a&gt; of the virus in the US. It’s unclear if they’ll be sufficient to make a dent in the virus’ spread — the strain moves so quickly that waiting until next month to start sending out tests likely won’t blunt the initial surge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlXGmA"&gt;Biden also plans to invoke the Defense Production Act to increase the pace of coronavirus test production, and the White House says the Strategic National Stockpile has “hundreds of millions of N-95 masks,” more than 100,000 ventilators, and other personal protective equipment “ready to ship out if and when states need them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpg0EJ"&gt;White House press secretary &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/12/20/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-december-20-2021/"&gt;Jen Psaki said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that Biden’s planned speech was not about another lockdown but rather “being directly clear with the American people about the benefits of being vaccinated, the steps we’re going to take to increase access, increase testing, and the risks posed to unvaccinated individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOOpkF"&gt;The administration plans to have new federal testing sites set up before Christmas in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Logitech bet big on work from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAU-vy1JPc2XXiWoczdfh6Mhtyo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301347/VRG_ILLO_Decoder_BrackenDarrell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Bracken Darrell talks about the mouse and keyboard renaissance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="be8tyh"&gt;Logitech is one of those ubiquitous companies — it’s been around since 1981, selling all kinds of important things that connect to computers of all shapes and sizes: mice, keyboards, cases, cameras, you name it. When Bracken Darrell took over in 2013, he restructured the company around growth, started making acquisitions like Blue microphones, and invested heavily in software. In fact, the last time I talked with Bracken, it was the end of 2019, and he laid out a vision of Logitech as a software and services company in addition to its hardware business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WZpHQ"&gt;Unfortunately, 2020 happened, and the pandemic sent a huge number of people to work from home, and suddenly, Logitech keyboards and mice and webcams were the hottest things around. I actually had to buy a Logitech webcam on the gray market in 2020 — demand was just that high. And now, 20 months into this thing, Logitech is making new products specifically designed for working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igTRcS"&gt;Bracken and I talked about that, how the company met that demand, whether that changed his plans, and how the supply chain issues around the world affect his business. We also talked about how he manages Logitech’s relationships with other tech giants: Logitech is one of the few companies with close access to Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem, and it, of course, has to sell products through Amazon, which has a long history of undercutting its own vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUIcIj"&gt;And we had to talk about the decision to kill the Harmony remote line, the growth Logitech has seen in products for creators and streamers, the mess that is USB-C, the metaverse, and more. Bracken even told me what his favorite mechanical keyboard switches are. This one has everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rg4gAy"&gt;Bracken Darrell, CEO of Logitech. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FL6yQG"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2359498144" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Or0pwp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbEct6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bracken Darrell, you are the CEO of Logitech. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUjqWQ"&gt;Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTBD91"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last time you and I had a chance to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20902987/logitech-ceo-bracken-darrell-streamlabs-interview-vergecast"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;talk to each other was 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I had you on our other show, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You were just acquiring a company called Streamlabs. You were talking about becoming a software and services company. Then 2020 happened, and we all went home. I bought a Logitech webcam for a 300 percent black-market markup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4Yl31"&gt;Oh, I’m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag560K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was impossible to get, but it was great. It was worth it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4B2Q2"&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0WH7Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But just tell me about that moment in the business for Logitech; you were on a trajectory to become a larger kind of software and services organization, then everyone had to work from home. Demand for things like keyboards and mice and webcams shot through the roof. The PC industry experienced a little bit of a renaissance. Tell me about that moment and managing through that early part of the pandemic — it seemed really challenging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92RBRL"&gt;It was really surreal. Around March 8th, I was in New York. We had just given an investor meeting. We kind of forecasted what we were going to do over the next several years. Of course, this COVID thing was being talked about, but it wasn’t a big deal. Then I flew home, and literally the next Monday we shut the office down. Everything was closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ub9lPt"&gt;For the next month, we had a very good outlook for the year. We expected to grow 8 to 10 percent. We’ve been growing at or near double digits for the last five or six years, and along this trajectory there are these long-term secular trends: video’s going to take over audio. Gaming’s going to become the biggest collection of sports in the world. Streaming and creating is going to be the next big, big, big thing — even bigger than gaming. The mouse and the keyboards are going to do just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="AGxRBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfoa0N"&gt;What happened was all those businesses went through the floor. They just dropped out of existence. Our sales completely collapsed for the first month or two after COVID, but we knew it was temporary. We knew it wasn’t going to stay like that. I don’t think people knew what was going to happen yet. Our retail business had disappeared. We knew people were buying for working at home, but we sold mostly through retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWAwc9"&gt;The toughest part of that individual moment was: what do we do now? A lot of people started cutting costs and conserving cash. I had a discussion with my head of operations; people have to work from home, but we won’t have enough inventory to supply them if COVID comes roaring back. So I said to him, “What do you think about making a big inventory bet?” He said, “Yeah, I think you’re right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxnG2E"&gt;We made a very big inventory bet and we’re lucky we did. We grew 74 percent last year because we had the inventory to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxfQdM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So that was an early bet. You were assuming that work from home was going to be here for real. People are going to need mice and keyboards. That’s a hardware business — you have to actually make the stuff and stock it to sell. How early did you actually make that bet? What’s the timeframe between the decision to increase inventory and selling it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eTSTh"&gt;We have to make that bet a minimum of two months beforehand, but in some cases you’re producing about four to six months in advance, depending on parts availability. It was a short-term bet, but we set the table for the next six to eight months. We were lucky. I won’t pretend we were geniuses. We just followed our intuition. Now it seems obvious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZDcwh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re 18 months into COVID, and some people are going back to the office and some people aren’t. That’s going to play out however it plays out, but I can see now there are products designed to be work-from-home products. You have some, there are Zoom displays, there’s a new webcam startup, which is not something we’d ever seen before. There’s an ecosystem of companies and products now that are focused on a work-from-home consumer as opposed to customers buying enterprise hardware and software for their homes, which is kind of what was happening before. The bet you made to make sure you had the inventory — was that the existing product line?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoesXH"&gt;That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXdB2M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you start realizing that you had to make new kinds of products for work-from-home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vu8ZqV"&gt;The lucky situation we’ve been in is that those four secular trends I mentioned earlier are long-term. We were already making products that really fit into your life and into your home. We really ran the same play — instead of growing, though, at double digits, we were growing 25 percent at first, then 64 percent, then 100 percent. Our growth rates went way up, but it was really the same play. We really didn’t change the strategy or the portfolio. We were already building that portfolio for those people who were working in a hybrid environment. The hybrid environment just came much faster than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGqdqN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the flip side of things, building things with chips in them has gotten increasingly difficult because of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chip shortage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and the supply chain crunch. As the trend increases, the demand is there, but what I’ve been told from everyone is that the supply is the problem. How have you been managing through that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXZi2l"&gt;We’re kind of lucky in that we have a very distributed portfolio. We’re in 36 different categories and probably 30 of those are chipsets, and they’re not 15 chipsets that go into 36 categories. I don’t know how many, but a lot, so when we were short on one chipset, we could try to shift our business to other products that didn’t require that chipset. Between that, and really having a good long-term relationship with our suppliers, we’ve probably managed around that better than most companies have, but we’re not immune to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaaSI6"&gt;We’ve had to develop alternative sources of supply. If you’ve talked to people like me, you know that instead of working 100 percent of the time on new products, we are working 80 percent of our time on alternative supply. We’re using a different chipset in an existing product. That’s largely over for us. I would say we’re 80 percent of the way through that. We still have some limitations, but it’s not terrible now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2xLzF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I’ve talked to other CEOs in other industries, the predictions of when the chip crunch will end are kind of all over the map, depending on the field. The carmakers are thinking it’ll be another year, maybe even more. They just seem tired. Companies that make smaller things with newer kinds of chips in them see the light at the end of the tunnel. Do you feel like the end is in sight? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qkRDi"&gt;I think so. I think we’re looking at six months to a year of the shortages. As I said, most of our chipset issues are resolved. We still have some left and we’re limited, but we’re just about there. The shorter-term issue for us now is, ironically, logistics. This is probably another thing that your guests are talking about — just this bizarre problem where there’s just not enough big cases to ship products over the water. It’s really a strange dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVAJBZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a container ship loaded up with Logitech mice and keyboards just waiting to get into a port somewhere right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vj1JnC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is there a container ship loaded up with Logitech mice and keyboards just waiting to get into a port somewhere right now?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hFdp8M"&gt;Oh, for sure. It was a little worse for us last quarter when going into Europe. Almost every company is struggling with this, by the way, so we’re not unique. This will clear naturally, but it will clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QstI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The great benefit software companies have is they can change the product at a moment’s notice. They can react to the market very quickly. I think Zoom reacted every 20 seconds, at the early part of the pandemic. But you know, mice and keyboards are physical products. Conference microphones, webcams — people are using them in ways that were sort of unexpected. You know you’re having problems shipping the products, but you still want to change them and meet the market demand. How is that competitive environment for you? Do you see competitors moving faster that are smaller, maybe? Are you moving at the speed you want to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SC4K3q"&gt;You’re never moving as fast as you want to, but we do move pretty quickly. We have a very fast development cycle for products. We measure that all the time. It did slow down during the pandemic, mainly because our resources were pulled into developing alternative components and suppliers. From a competitive standpoint, I love our position. I love the fact that we do occasionally meet small startup competitors who are coming into the market hungry. It makes us better. I’ve been here almost 10 years now, and I really want to feel smaller as we get bigger. That means you have to have small teams. They have to feel complete ownership for what they’re doing. They need to have a lot of freedom. You have to give up a lot to get a lot, and I love that feeling. When I was a general manager running a small team, I loved that moment, so I want to give that to more people in our company. We’re trying to organize that way, and I’d say we’re 50 percent successful. I want to get to 80-90 percent. We’ll never get to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc8L0u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This leads into what I think of as the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; questions. The last time we talked in 2019, you said there’s 22 brands inside of Logitech, and they have some autonomy. Have you changed that? How’s Logitech structured now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWIOa0"&gt;We have 22 businesses, and fewer brands. Logitech G is the big brand, but now we’ve gone from 22 to the mid-30s. We keep adding categories all the time. That’s not going to change. We always have these seed programs in development that are secret. They’re small teams, sometimes run by entrepreneurs who are developing new things. A lot of them don’t work, which is fine. We give them a bonus and they move on to something else, but it’s a very dynamic place for new category development and it’s happening throughout the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCotGc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do those teams cross over? Do the Blue microphone folks talk to the webcam folks to make their microphones better?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmv43o"&gt;A little bit. Our teams are pretty independent and they work hard. On the engineering side, though, for example, we now have Blue microphones working directly with our gaming team. We are bringing Blue technology to the gaming mics and the gaming headsets. We definitely try to take advantage when we can take a strong capability of one team and bring it to another one, but I love the independence. I love playing basketball on a five-person team. I love small teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mS3PEt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is kind of a core trade-off, even in terms of cost structure. You undoubtedly have some technology duplication on these teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szJngz"&gt;We do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFNQjR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You could maybe have more efficiency in how you invest in engineering, if you shared more stuff, but it seems like you’re making a very clear trade-off. Some duplication is fine, as long as you go fast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlhLkh"&gt;That’s exactly right. We try to be collaborative and open so teams can learn from each other. But a little duplication is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFoypL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you measure that? Do you think about that in terms of the cost structure of the company? We’ve got a microphone team over here and a microphone team over here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MioGh"&gt;We do. We have the debates you’d expect, and those things flare up once in a while. Then my CFO kind of hits me over the head with the frying pan and I try to shake it off — then I try to sell it and swing back at him. Yes, we do have those debates and occasionally efficiency wins, but usually creativity rules the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJeI9K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was just talking to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769839/anker-battery-charger-gan-amazon-apple-mfi-lightning-iphone-magsafe-decoder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the CEO of Anker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. He told me that they have a long process to think about how to enter a new product category — lots of memos and meetings. What’s your process to enter a new category with all these independent teams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dr94pn"&gt;Our process is very organic and pretty fast. If we have a category that we think is exciting, we review the category with a very small team. I’ve got a very small corporate development team that is amazing. We’ll look at it together. The first thing we do is we try to find somebody to come in and develop it. Sometimes it happens organically: one team splits somebody off, puts them on it. Sometimes we hire somebody from the outside. I met an entrepreneur at a coffee break in a seminar, and we hired him. He came in and started a business in one of these. Then he added a person and another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLUjUv"&gt;Then we meet with them regularly. Their money is separated. They don’t get money like venture capital, where they get 1 or 2 years of money. Instead, they get a few months worth of money and some deliverables. Then I meet with them, with our very small team. We challenge them. They give us updates. We give them more money when they look like they need it. It’s a very organic process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UutRTe"&gt;We look on the outside for M&amp;amp;A. If we see things that we can acquire that can accelerate or replace it completely, just put us in the market right away. I’m scared of M&amp;amp;A when we don’t know the category, so sometimes we’ll develop these teams with the thought that we might end up doing M&amp;amp;A, but we really want to understand the products better before we do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BALQx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So do you put together a small team to imagine a product that would enter some new category?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3buaL"&gt;That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vh2fYR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboards with the track ball attached — I’m just making up a category.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg20hm"&gt;That’s a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10H3Pe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then, do you say, “We think we’re going to buy something, but I want this team to understand what that product should look like and what that market should look like before we go shopping”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RpIFn"&gt;I wouldn’t say, “We’re probably going to buy something.” The team would say, “You guys have to develop the best product in the world.” The team doesn’t really want to buy something. We’re looking outside for something to buy. They’re not really interested. They would want to create the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvlLkp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you spend your time? You’ve got all these autonomous teams. They’re off to the races, getting things done. Where do you spend your time the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="v524RE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I spend maybe half my time on new products and innovations.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1qBD6"&gt;I spend maybe half my time on new products and innovations, whether it’s these teams or on the products teams. Probably the other half of my time is split. Most of it is people stuff, whether it’s bringing in people or talking one-on-one with people here. I love to be in touch with people at all levels of the company. Even in the pandemic, I’ve tried to not just be doing one-on-ones with my direct reports. I really want to be more in touch than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7jyFC"&gt;I want this company to be almost like the small company where everybody knows the CEO. I like that, so I try to do that. I spend a lot of time with entrepreneurs outside, too. Maybe 20 percent of my time is spent talking to entrepreneurs, between three per day to three per week. I love that because I feel I’m really on the edge of what’s coming, because entrepreneurs always are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kbUFq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of decisions do you find yourself making in all those meetings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsiScx"&gt;The decisions I make —  that any CEO makes — are the ones that are left over when all the other decisions are made. Those decisions are ones nobody else can make, like the ones that cross over organizations. Like the duplication issue: should we make it more efficient or not? That’s a decision. Those decisions are the ones that I usually make. I try not to make decisions that are inside of everybody’s business, if I can. I certainly have opinions on them, but I don’t make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqJQdj"&gt;What’s the vision, what’s the strategy? What are the effectiveness or efficiency choices you can make that are crossing over things? Then I make hiring decisions for key people that I’m going to work with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amdH5u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people are at Logitech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8OFtL"&gt;We’ve got about 6,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUojd2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you gotten bigger over the past year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOpIFt"&gt;Yes. Actually, we’ve doubled in people over the last three years. Half our people are new over the last three years. A lot of them have never seen many other people in Logitech in person. It’s really weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmR8Bt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a good thing you guys make a line of videoconferencing products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nV9s4h"&gt;Thank God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSq3u7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you dogfooding? You’re the CEO — are you lighting up your camera and being like, “Man, this doesn’t look good. I have to find that product manager.” How does that work for you? I would be very tempted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LM1zT"&gt;I’m dogfooding all the time. I’ve got so many products around. I’m in the office right now and I actually was just using our newest product for the conference room. It’s got this really cool “follow you” feature if you move around — it moves a little too fast for me, so that’s some of my feedback. I’ve got new products spread around my desk all the time. I’m trying new stuff every day. I love it. It’s one of the most fun things about this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCO4lb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people report to you? What are your lines of decision-making there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E45p6S"&gt;I have 23 direct reports, which is a little on the high side for most people, but I really like that. People ask, “How do you manage 23 people?” And I always say, “Well, if I have to manage them, I can’t have 23 people reporting to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQESKH"&gt;So I don’t manage 23 people: I have 23 people that are my partners and we work alongside each other. And so I have an hour-long meeting every week where each of those 23 people spends a minute or two and says, “Here’s what’s not going right.” Or, “Here’s a problem that I’m dealing with. Here’s what you should know about.” That’s it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsJKNU"&gt;Then we have two big meetings every three months. One of those meetings looks back on what we learned, and the other one looks forward on where we’re headed. Those are different topics, so it’s a fun little rhythm and it’s not overly bureaucratic. It’s sometimes a little chaotic, but it’s super interesting and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elo1yO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a lot of excitement around entering new categories and figuring out how to do it. I feel you had to know this question was coming. The last time I talked to you, I asked about what was happening with the Harmony remotes. Just a few months ago, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377015/logitech-discontinues-harmony-universal-remotes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you finally wound it down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s562Ga"&gt;I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WAPLR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a flip side to entering a new category. Tell me about the decision to leave that market. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhBxaG"&gt;It’s really tough to decide when to stop doing something. It’s one of the hardest decisions of business. I heard Jeff Bezos on stage actually address this. An interviewer asked, “How do you decide when you stop one of those things?” He paused for a second, then said, “When the last passionate advocate folds.” The interviewer followed up: “Who’s usually the last passionate advocate?” Bezos said, “Me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuGxYP"&gt;That’s kind of the way I feel about new products. That’s the way I feel about old products. I grew up doing products for marketing, and I think we can make anything successful. I’m always optimistic all the way from the first to last day. I was optimistic about Harmony. I still think we could do something with Harmony, but it goes back to resources. Where are you going to focus? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZMs7z"&gt;There are people who absolutely adore Harmony, and we’re going to keep supporting them, but we’re not going to create a great business out of Harmony. We have so many great businesses, and so many more we’re creating, but Harmony isn’t going to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU2fex"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But walk me inside that decision. Maybe you’re the last passionate advocate. What was the thing that made you realize Logitech could do this, but you’re not going to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOQag4"&gt;When Harmony was created, there were a whole bunch of devices sitting around you in your living room — all with individual remotes. It’s a nightmare. You don’t know where the remote went for the subwoofer. You have a couch that’s full of remotes. You’re sitting on 12 remotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3QBaC"&gt;Harmony simplified all that dramatically, compiling it all into one remote. It was super easy and it was beautiful. Roll forward: now you’ve got fewer and fewer devices. More features are integrated into the TV itself or into your Apple TV, so you don’t need as many remotes. The complexity’s inside the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMMHST"&gt;Now you’ve got a whole bunch of apps instead of remotes. The real question was, “Can we be an app selector? Can we somehow be the interface between all those apps and you?” We looked at it. We all thought hard about it. We realized that app selection is the domain of players that are already in the market doing a good job. We’ve got to be able to do something special for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3r5C1"&gt;After a lot of hard thought, we just decided that we have so many more opportunities out there that we’re going to leave that category behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1IgJD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask the same question in a different category. The pandemic hits. Everyone goes to work from home. You thought mice and keyboards were going to be a nice solid business, but maybe not growing. Now that category is explosive. Are you rolling more resources at different kinds of mice and keyboards? The basics that I think about when I think about Logitech — is that a new area of investment for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WrgVS"&gt;Yes. Ironically, when I came to Logitech 10 years ago, one of the first things I did was to take 75 percent of the people out of mice and keyboards and put them into new things, because I thought it would be a slow growth category. Little did I know, those categories kept growing pretty nicely. The better we got at innovating using design in those categories, the higher the growth got. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWWqxw"&gt;Actually, even before the pandemic, we were growing very nicely in mice and keyboards, so we had already put a bunch of resources into it. We already had a really good strategy for growth and for attracting different types of audiences. When the pandemic hit, we were already there. We’ll keep investing. I’m excited about those businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0rE4W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think it’s very tempting to think of mice and keyboards as being boring, but keyboards in particular have become a cultural product. Mechanical keyboard fans are deep into what switches they’re using. Logitech actually just released an adorable keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="134MxT"&gt;Oh, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frscmI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influencers on TikTok and YouTube show off their office setups. Keyboards and mice have become a cultural product as much as a utility product. Was that investment in place or is that something you had to pivot? Was that something that came up to you, or did you have a keyboards product manager that insisted Logitech start making extremely adorable keyboards, because that’s where the market is? How does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMNO8V"&gt;We have loved keyboards for years, always, but especially in the last five or six years, we just felt like we could do a lot more with keyboards. Mechanical keyboards took off first in gaming in Korea, I think. Now they’re making their way into non-gaming applications. The one you talk about — POP Keys — we launched first in China. Now it’s launching in the US and Europe. It’s adorable and super fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3UsBTo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We do have somebody who wakes up and goes to bed thinking about those adorable keyboards. That one is a big business for us and we got really excited about it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bbF0xP"&gt;We do have somebody who wakes up and goes to bed thinking about those adorable keyboards. That one is a big business for us and we got really excited about it. The leader of that business got very excited about it. We’ve been talking about it for four or five years and she’s done such a great job. Art, who works for her, has also done an amazing job. We’ve got a team that are super passionate about keyboards. Believe me, to them it’s certainly not boring, and to me either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M39rkg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think of keyboards as a culture product? Keyboards are an interesting category. The aesthetics are really important, but those mechanical keyboard fans care about the feel. They will argue about reliability. They know the names of the switches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jT7GsN"&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvEzt1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you deeply invested in switch engineering? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mZapx"&gt;We are. We’ve developed our own switches from time to time. We worked with the big switch makers too. We have a really, really deep understanding of switches. Switches are in everything, mice and keyboards. Some switches are no longer real switches — they’re actually magnets. They feel like a switch, but it’s just a magnet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q729Iu"&gt;We’re deep in the technology of all that, but when you step out of it, I think keyboards already have become cultural products in some places and some applications, especially gaming. And I think it’s possible that keyboards could become even more of a cultural product, so I’m glad that you are intrigued by these new POP Keys. I am too. I love this product. You can pop off the keys and put on emojis. It’s just a cool physical thing to do. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuqAyh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we talked two years ago before all this happened, the investment was really in gaming, and that was laddering into creators. The focus was on hardcore gamer products: RGB lights and lots of customization. You could see that from the Streamlabs acquisition. Here’s this big, growing market that is not the same as a lot of people working from home. There are &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22807858/tiktok-influencer-microsoft-excel-instagram-decoder-podcast"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excel influencers on TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; now, which I’m very intrigued by. All these things have happened that were not gaming. Are the products the same, or are you reusing some of that engineering? Are there new kinds of products? How are you attacking the developing trend that isn’t gaming? Do you have to shift resources to it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjfRSJ"&gt;Yeah, we create it. A couple things: first, I think gaming was really the most obvious and biggest thing we’ve ever done in lifestyle. We were really thinking of gaming as another category of physical products, but we discovered very quickly that these are lifestyle products. People really associate who they are with these sports. These are going to become the biggest collection of sports in the world. We realized that there’s really something there. As we started to look into it, we got really excited about streaming and creating — people like you, but on a much smaller scale, who are creating their own thing. People who want to have their own podcast or want to create music or create TikTok videos — could we help those people fulfill their passions? We ended up buying Blue Microphones and we went deeper into all the categories. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20886060/logitech-streamlabs-obs-acquisition-twitch"&gt;We went into Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt; first because of gaming. Then we realized how cool this could be for general streamers. It’s an easy way to set up. They can make money and we won’t collect any of it. Streamers can create their own merch. They can have hats and shirts just with a click of a button. We decided this is really, really cool. We can enable a whole generation of people to try to make a living —  or at least try to make a following — in that space. A lot of that was existing technology. Some of it is new and we’re developing it right now. We’re super excited about this space, just like we were excited for gaming. I think general streamers are a bigger space by far than gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBzNzN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was asking our team for their questions for you. They noticed that there’s a flood of new consumer products and productivity products from Logitech. But the cadence of gaming products has slowed down. Is that a choice that you’ve made where you’re rolling resources towards these bigger markets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZRAJd"&gt;Well, I think your team is probably right. We discovered that we were launching a whole lot of products in gaming, and they were good, but they were small. Once in a while, we would launch a product like G502, which is the biggest selling mouse in the world. It’s a huge product that took us a long time to develop. So we decided that it might be best to ramp that up and really develop fewer products that have a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIyPYa"&gt;Our [gaming] leader Ujesh Desai made that call. I remember him talking to me about it. I said, “You know, I feel like we can do better than this.” We’ve slowed down. Now when we launch a product, man, is it big! We launched a super light mouse that weighs 64 grams. The pros love it. And that thing is a monster. It’s the biggest gaming mouse ever, I think, next to the G502. So we are slowing down, but launching better, bigger products in gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUHP64"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that on the flip side, you’re putting out more products now to figure out where the hits will be in the consumer and productivity categories? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPMWxu"&gt;I’m going to give Ujesh credit for that, because even though he was launching a lot of things that were smaller, it actually paid off because he found the right big one. The inverse is actually true and false. On the one hand, it is true that launching more products is a great way to discover new things. On the other hand, we already know the categories in the core productivity mouse and keyboards so well. As we’ve ramped up, they’ve become big products overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kya9iT"&gt;As we launched these things, we launched MX Keys, which is a very high-end keyboard — the highest end keyboard I think we’ve really ever sold. It’s a monster. It’s one of our biggest keyboards now. When we launched those keyboards and mice in the productivity section, they’ve all been huge. MX Master 3 is a monster in size and in revenue. We haven’t had to do as much experimentation there. POP Keys — that cool and sexy-looking mechanical keyboard — might be viewed as an experiment, but I bet it’s going to be very big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm4yBm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a mechanical keyboard person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfIQhB"&gt;I go back and forth. For a while I used one of our gaming mechanical keyboards when I was in the office. At home I used a predecessor to MX Keys, which is a very quiet key feel. I like the substantial feedback of a mechanical key, but I also like the total silence of an MX Key, so I really go back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7ZPe1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a question direct from our staff: what’s your key switch of choice? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdpgO1"&gt;I’ll be killed for this if I answer it, but I’ll do it anyway because I’ll never step away from answering. I like Cherry, I really do. They do a really nice job. I think we’ve come up with keys that at times have been better, but they’re consistently very good keys. They’re very good switches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpN72Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Were you expecting the biggest controversial moment to be about key switches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukGSWp"&gt;No, I wasn’t. Had I been expecting it, I’d have mentioned it sooner. I still would have answered that question truthfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kQwfX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You make your own switches and you use some other switches. Cherry is a famous supplier of switches. I don’t believe that we often think about those suppliers the way that you might. Why decide to invest in your own versus going out and buying Cherry switches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DettSa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We only invest in areas where we feel like we could really do something substantial and different.“&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qdZuWe"&gt;We only invest in areas where we feel like we could really do something substantial and different. We felt like we could do something better, and we did. We’ve worked with alternative suppliers. There are two or three different companies doing switches for mechanical keys, and they’re all good. I think ours are very good. We do use Cherry. We use a range of things, and I suspect we’ll keep doing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPR8DO"&gt;I like the competition, too. I think the switch makers have gotten a lot better. One of the reasons why people like mechanical keys — and non-mechanical, the ones that are quiet — is that the switches have just gotten a lot better. The competition has really helped, the market size has grown, and it’s made it a more exciting place to be for investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJROwN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that market size growing, does that mean a bigger split? Are you selling more mechanical keyboards than standard ones now? Is that going to keep growing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Stb0KY"&gt;No, we’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="za4cpO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think it’s still pretty niche?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFfwhw"&gt;Gaming’s not a niche market, so it’s hard to call that niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2LVnQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see what you mean.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2IYjf"&gt;It’s mostly gaming today. There are places in the world where a lot of mechanical keyboards are used for non-gaming purposes, like China, for example. This generation that grew up playing games on mechanical keyboards want that feel in their regular keyboards. They’re the ones that are going to continue to grow that market long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJYRJQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve pushed you on keyboards enough, so let’s talk about some other markets you’ve entered. Logitech has a little bit of smart home stuff in your portfolio now: you have a camera and a doorbell. That is a crowded, difficult market to be in. You have to integrate with the two major smartphone platforms and Alexa, three gigantic companies that are always in a frenemy situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORzwQK"&gt;Yeah, you’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HHjLs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is that going? Why decide to enter that category, which is crowded and messy, versus something else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77PwnB"&gt;We’re in a lot of categories. You mentioned a couple of them that are in the home. They’re relatively small for us. We stay in those categories because we think it’s a lot easier to learn your way around if you live somewhere than looking in from the outside. We’re learning. We’re looking. We may discover that we’ve got a big play in there at some point. Right now that category doesn’t look really big and you don’t hear us talk about it very much, but I like having a little scouting force in that area, always looking around to see what’s there. Then if we get started, we can move fast. I like it. I like our doorbell a lot, by the way. It’s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iy3iZU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A doorbell is a really interesting product. You mount it on the wall and never really think about it unless it breaks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzAsEd"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ht8kL3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the cost structure requires running a cloud service and an app developer thinking about the doorbell app on two different platforms, at least.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUmjbI"&gt;That’s right. You do know our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MnBXY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon’s going to do something wacky with Alexa tomorrow. If this category is just a little scouting force, that’s a long cost for something that people can’t have break. How do you balance that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vtfQk"&gt;Think of how many things you learn from that: you learn how to manage a cloud service and how to work with Apple, Amazon, and Alexa. Those are capabilities that are super valuable as you enter new areas. Most of what we do tries to make the experience of one of those big platform players better. It also gives us experience with software engineering and services. I’m always in learning mode, and I love these categories because there’s a lot to learn. There’s a lot of stuff happening in the home. I think the home category is kind of still a mess — at least mine is — but I do think it will eventually clean up. It’ll be interesting to see how the home area starts to get organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJP0dN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working with Apple opens the door to a number of questions, but more importantly, most of your products right now connect to a computer or some other system through a standard, right? Mice, keyboards, webcams are all USB. The USB standards body is bad at naming things, but it exists and the USB standard continues to operate. You have a lot of Bluetooth products. The Bluetooth standards body is similarly messy, but existent. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPnqrI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart home is not there yet; they just rolled out a new standard called Matter. The three companies say they’re all going to work on it together. There is a new radio standard called Thread. Are you in those conversations? Are you saying, “We’ve gotta drive this,” or are you sitting back on the new standards?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TECpug"&gt;We’re very in there, especially in Matter. We’re super interested in it. We’ve got a team that looks at that all the time. It’s just really important that we understand where the standards are going — where Bluetooth is going, what’s included, who’s getting on it. This is the arteries and veins of our business. We really have to know what’s in there and we have to be able to play. We have great people who look at that all the time for us and help us guess where to go next. We’re not always right, but you have to time it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYAFlz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you in a position to drive the standards body, or are you in a position where you’re watching and seeing what happens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vgkXQ"&gt;We’re not going to drive the standards. We’re going to ride the standards. We’ll let the big guys go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNGWhM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the second episode of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in which I’ve fallen down the USB-C rabbit hole with a guest, but that standard is a mess. One connector for everything is a beautiful dream. I have no idea what’s going to happen when I see a plug like that, and that is something that directly affects a ton of the products you make. Are you in a position to say, “Hey, we actually are the ones that plug in to your computers. Our customers are confused,” or is that just a cost you bear because the big companies have decided they’re all going to use one connector?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2RJpQ"&gt;It is confusing, but USB-C is cool. I do like that the big companies seem to all be moving in that direction. It’s helpful for us: if everybody can get to one standard, then it’s more efficient on our end. Most importantly, USB-C is just easier for users. You don’t want everybody to be trying to figure out, like I was a few minutes ago, trying to find a cord to plug into a port. I was running around the floor out here, looking at people’s desks trying to scavenge a USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5YvYV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CEO is stealing headphones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RJwlw"&gt;I’m on video now. I may be fired tomorrow. But yeah, you don’t want people to have to do that. Things will always change, but it’d be nice if they change from one thing to the next, rather than from three things to four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAROtC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For something like Bluetooth, for example, Apple has its own proprietary extensions to Bluetooth that enable features on its headphones that Logitech could just never do. As you think about the veins and arteries of the business’s connection standards, the platforms are integrating more features and rolling out more proprietary extensions. How do you think about that threat? How do you model that out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJU3ZM"&gt;You mentioned Apple; I think Apple has done an incredible job of making easy products and including the connection. The AirPods are just a tour de force of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNpRY3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will note that Bracken is currently wearing some AirPods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QY84d"&gt;I am wearing AirPods, and I’m really impressed by how they made something in which the differences are small but so meaningful. I love that because I just think it’s amazing and so valuable if you can remove steps from a process. Removing steps is maybe the most valuable simplification there is. Nobody’s done that better than Apple in the tech world. It’s just magnificent. As part of that, Apple is actually pretty good about opening up. People talk about the closed system of Apple, but they’re also open in many other ways. The App Store is one of the most open systems there is, and they also open up and let you physically connect into their devices over time. As long as you deliver the quality of experience that they expect for their users, you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCiOoB"&gt;Apple’s standards are high, but that’s good. As long as you deliver against those standards, you have a pretty good shot at being able to be part of that. Most of the big companies in tech are that way in some way, shape, or form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK9EJH"&gt;Obviously, I love this business, so it’s hard for me to be anything but excited about the future. I do see things getting simpler, whether it’s those veins and arteries or the products themselves. I’m excited about what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAGqn1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push you on that. Every time Apple comes out with a new iPad, they make a keyboard and case for it. They’re the only company that uses their own keyboard connector on the back of the iPad. They’ve got the three little dots that make their own pogo pin connector. They have told me a thousand times that connector is open and anyone can use it, but I keep asking, “Where are the other companies that use it?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oY3uIn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, every time Apple comes out with a new iPad, there’s a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Logitech version of the keyboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that they’ve obviously developed with you all because your version comes out right away, it works, and it fits a different part of the market. I just see that as Logitech maintaining a privileged position with Apple where they get out ahead of competitors, but you’re still not using the open connector on the back of the iPad. You’re making the products early and you get to be at the front of the line, but it’s still not as good as Apple’s product that uses their own connector. What is the dynamic there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKK9iZ"&gt;Actually, we do use their connector. I’ve got one sitting in front of me right now that does use the smart connector from Apple. They have opened that to us from time to time. I can’t speak for Apple at all. They’re very secretive and they don’t share secrets with me. I’ll speculate a little bit, though. I really think their rulebook on this is more about delivering an amazing experience for their users, because that’s what their users expect and that’s what Apple wants to deliver. Apple will occasionally let somebody in that walled garden, as long as they can deliver that experience. If they can’t, then they’re not in. There are probably companies that could, that won’t get in because they haven’t proven that yet, but I really respect Apple’s position. I think it’s a tough standard, and it’s made us better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gvcvg8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing that we’ve observed is that phone vendors have to compete with AirPods. If you buy a Pixel phone, the best headphones to buy are the Pixel buds. If you buy a Samsung phone, the best headphones to buy are Samsung’s headphones. The ecosystem is getting wider into proprietary lanes — not just Apple, but every company. Do you see that as something that you have to push back against, or are there categories where that just isn’t happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdKRQM"&gt;It’s always been true that there were proprietary devices or peripherals that came with the primary devices, and it puts pressure on us to deliver a better experience and better products and know the customer even better. The only advantage we have is that we don’t exist if we don’t do it better than the peripheral that’s in the box. That puts so much pressure on us to innovate well — you can tell that I love that pressure to innovate. I would much rather be in that spot than a commodity business where I just have to sell more pegs than somebody else. I really want to innovate better than other people, so the pressure’s on us. I like that. I’ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STKWC8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask you about that commodity product concept because that’s kind of the flip side of the business: you can make great products, you can innovate well, you can invest in basic components like key switches, but you also have to market and retail the products. That has changed a lot in the last year, but Amazon is notorious for noticing that a product is selling well so they immediately release an Amazon-label version. What’s the dynamic? How has the sales market changed, and how do you think about that? Logitech products command a premium because of the brand and the investment, but you’re next to a lot of commodity versions of your own products now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qARW8k"&gt;It’s really interesting: when the company started, we were an OEM manufacturer for HP, Apple, and Dell. We were still an OEM manufacturer until about five years ago when we exited. At that point it was about 10 percent of our business. Because we were an OEM manufacturer, we also had our own products that sold at retail right next to the same products we were competing with. We had to have something better because those products were in the box and ours weren’t. We tended to innovate better, adding more features and building in more power for the dollar. We’ve just kept doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AXAKI"&gt;I view that as wonderful. I’m so proud when I hear that somebody knocked off our product. In a way, I really feel good about that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wmcVcp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m so proud when I hear that somebody knocked off our product.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yJG3Cr"&gt;Now if they knocked off our product and took something that we owned that they shouldn’t have, then we should act appropriately, but I don’t view that as the problem at all. That’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0Q4tD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s very diplomatic. People who are working from home are buying peripherals. If I want to buy a G502, I’m typing it in Google or the Amazon search box and hoping that it comes up. Those are some pretty important middlemen — one of which likes to make its own products and put them at the top of its search results. How do you manage that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCqFPv"&gt;I think we need to be better at managing the whole chain. First, we need to have a G502 that’s known to be better. That product in particular is better. That’s the best-selling mouse in the world, so there will be other things that are going to pop up, including from other companies like those. We still have to win by creating something that’s better: getting reputation, getting those five stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA6S1w"&gt;We’ve gotten really, really good at working within the Amazon ecosystem of selling. We need to have really good capability, and we’ve built that over the last few years. We’re very good there now. Amazon and other companies helped us be very good. We need to be unparalleled or unbeatable in terms of being able to go to market online, the same as we were offline. We’re almost there now and we’re not going to let up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCZ1np"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you foresee bringing any of that relationship direct? Do you see your website becoming a sales channel that competes with everybody else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJPSwu"&gt;We have a sales channel but it’s very small and it will grow, but our primary business is not to sell direct. I like direct selling because it gives you a relationship with customers and you can understand what you should be doing better, but I don’t envision us becoming like some of the other companies where 50 percent of our sales go through our own channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSI8Mz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the mix of sales channels changed for you in the past 18 months? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9A7W7"&gt;Yeah. It ramped up when we were short because people were so desperate. They just wanted to buy, and they couldn’t find it where they normally buy, so they went to us. We sold a lot. It did change materially, but it didn’t become 50 percent of our business in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTpkb0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I bought the C920 webcam. It was definitely Chinese when I bought it marked up on eBay. I did it partially just to see what would happen, but that channel’s full now. You’re selling more online, I’m assuming, but was that an impact? Did you see that you were out of product, but the channel is filling on eBay? Did you feel that you had to push back against that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fu6YH"&gt;You always see products come through secondary markets like that … We occasionally have a frustrating period where we have to deal with that and it kind of hurts. It destroys the price on another channel. Generally speaking, though, I think it’s being managed pretty well. It’s a fairly orderly market. It’s competitive, but it’s orderly. We are managing it better today than we’ve ever managed in the history of the company. We’ve learned by making so many mistakes — they were our mistakes, usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suY5ua"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s end where we started: in 2019, you said Logitech was going to become a software and services company, a cloud accessories and peripherals company. Obviously in the last 18 months, you’ve refocused the business in a lot of ways. Logitech is making adorable keyboards. I don’t think there’s a cloud component to the keyboards yet, but we’ll see. What’s the future? What’s next for Streamlabs? What’s next for the connected services? Is that still where you’re headed, or has this period of refocusing changed any of that plan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrBCcC"&gt;We were born a hardware company and we’ll stay a hardware company. We’re going to create more and more great things and we’ll enter new hardware categories. The services component is very, very small for us today. You mentioned Streamlabs — that’s a super exciting business and it’s growing fast. We’re expanding it in different directions. We’re also creating new services across a lot of our business today and those will grow. It’ll be more and more significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vm2o3y"&gt;I think we’re going to be a hardware and services company. The services are going to be a very small part of our business for a while, but they’ll grow. … Eventually they’ll be meaningful and people will say, “Ah, they really did mean it when they said they’re going to get into services.” We do mean it. We really do. I’m really excited about it. It’s super fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfNky7"&gt;I’ll close on this. Design is so interesting. I was talking to John Maeda, who is a great designer, and I asked him, “What’s the difference between designing a hardware product versus designing an app or a software or a service experience?” He said, “They’re as different as can be.” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Designing a product’s like designing a chair. A chair is the standard for design. Designing an app or a service is like designing an entire college campus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQQBfQ"&gt;I thought that’s really true. It’s so dynamic and so fast, but the other difference is that you can change the college campus all the time, so it’s exciting and fun. In the future we’re going to be very, very dynamic. It’ll make us better and faster at everything because we will have a service business that’s meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljYLZk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you look at some of the trends that have radically accelerated over the past year, the one that comes to mind that’s real is the creator economy. We just see more and more people building media businesses at home, building direct-to-consumer businesses at home.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you see that as a market that you can actually provide services to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAUY0R"&gt;We have four big business areas: video collaboration is a billion-dollar business. The core mouse and keyboard business is way over a billion dollars. Gaming is also way over a billion-dollar business. The fourth one is the streamers and creators business. Today it’s much smaller than a billion dollars, but it’s growing very fast. And the streamers and creators area absolutely can be bigger than the other three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V03LnE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obviously it’s Streamlabs, but Logitech has to make a ring light. Where do you see the growth in streamers and creators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6221gD"&gt;I would never disclose potential features of categories we might enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xANI97"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logitech is going to make a ring light. Can I break on the show that you have a ring light coming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gAjwIm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re absolutely going to do more stuff in the creator and streamer space.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ky1HcZ"&gt;If we were even thinking about that, it would be top secret. If ring lights even crossed our minds, we wouldn’t mention it. We’re absolutely going to do more stuff in the creator and streamer space. We love that space. The definition of the purpose of the company, as you know, is often kind of an eye roll for people, but it’s to enable all people to fulfill their passions. It’s to enable creators who are doing stuff digitally online that they’re super passionate about. We’re creating things all the time for those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIAPww"&gt;We’re also doing so many things in the diversity, equity, and inclusion space. I’m super excited about that and am directly connected with that. It’s just so, so exciting. As you said, very eloquently, this is the most exciting thing happening in the world. It was already exciting and during the pandemic, it just exploded. This genie is not going back anywhere near the bottle. It’s all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oXH9y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re not going to disclose the ring light to me — although I think you have — but do you think the opportunity there is creation hardware? Do you think the opportunity is cameras and lights and stream decks, or is it software and services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VTfsT"&gt;I think the opportunities are absolutely in both directions. There will always be hardware. We’re good at that. Hardware is hard as hell mainly because of the logistics of the supply chain. Services connected to that hardware are absolutely going to be part of our future. We’re super excited about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqkBVF"&gt;Streamlabs has been amazing. I’ve learned more from Streamlabs than any other business, probably since I got here. I’m so impressed by the team that we have running it. Every time I talk to George [Kurdin, Streamlabs head of product], my IQ goes up about 10 points, which puts me at about 40 so far. It’s really fun. We’re going to do both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoUN8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last question: I have to ask you about another category that I don’t think is real yet; the endless conversation about the metaverse. Facebook renamed itself. Microsoft thinks we’re all going to work in headsets. That directly implicates your businesses: if we’re all in virtual worlds, maybe we don’t need mechanical keyboards. Is that even a blink on the horizon of a competitive threat to you, that you’re going to have to sell Logitech G502 NFTs in the Facebook metaverse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJYcvY"&gt;I do think there will be a lot of people sitting in headsets doing what we think of as productivity work today or playing games in much the same way we own a PC today. But we’ve had five or six years of working on VR and AR, and I haven’t found any better input tools than the mouse and the keyboard yet for that. I think they’re going to do very well in that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjstOx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. Bracken, thank you so much for coming on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It’s always a pleasure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="94CvdQ"&gt;Thank you so much for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s time for car companies to shut up about electric vehicles and just ship them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tyG0X2tW_BFke9pVa9U65FKqdAQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301268/ahawkins_20210503_4551_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For years, car companies have been promising a major shift to electric — and now they finally have to deliver&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zZuSLg"&gt;Ford CEO Jim Farley calls it a “watershed moment.” GM’s Mary Barra says it’s an “inflection point.” Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess says it’s a “crucial moment for our company.” And Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota, describes it as “a diversified and uncharted era.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AaMeI"&gt;The auto industry is going electric. We know because they’ve been telling us, over and over, in earnings calls, virtual events, podcast interviews, and in many television commercials. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;Hi, Malcolm Gladwell!&lt;/a&gt;) Gone will be the dirty internal combustion engines of yesteryear, replaced by zero-tailpipe emission electric vehicles. The future is here, and it probably has a light bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJAEVh"&gt;The spotlight is on the auto industry like never before. President Joe Biden, who is spearheading a plan to spend billions of dollars on EV charging infrastructure and new incentives for car buyers, has test driven not one but two electric pickup trucks this year. Car companies are under enormous pressure to help usher in this electric future. And they know it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kDkRqj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The transition to EVs is both happening far later than many people had hoped for and far faster than most legacy OEMs expected two or three years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDn2qP"&gt;“The transition to EVs is both happening far later than many people had hoped for and far faster than most legacy [automakers] expected two or three years ago,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for electric mobility at Guidehouse Insights. He argues that car companies have been “downplaying” the prospect of mass adoption of electric vehicles for years, sitting back while Tesla soaked up market share. Now, EV sales are way up, Tesla is one of the most valuable companies in history, and the entire auto industry finally sees there’s profit in plug-in cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4As9iD"&gt;As expected, the transition has been stilted and plagued with problems. There’ve been battery fires, recalls, fraud allegations, a global chip shortage, and numerous missed deadlines. The number of new electric vehicles that went on sale this year is still laughably small compared to all the gas-guzzling, planet-warming, glacier-melting trucks and SUVs that still dominate the roads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw2PWr"&gt;The rollout of new EVs remains fairly thin. There’s the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volkswagen ID 4 … and that’s about it. The Porsche Taycan and Polestar 2 helped fill out the premium segment, while shorter-range EVs, like the BMW i3, Ford Focus Electric, and the VW e-Golf, got the ax. Audi released a $140,000 electric sports car that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798695/audi-rs-etron-gt-review-ev-specs-price"&gt;fantastic to drive&lt;/a&gt; but won’t move the sales needle that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Z_aD_1agpLjK_liT9GOg2eyDeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278732/sokane_210121_4386_0007.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JjkMc"&gt;Other rollouts have been a mixed bag. Rivian, which went public in one of the biggest IPOs of all time, saw its stock tumble on the news that production of its first electric truck and SUV would be slow going. The 2021 Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV were both recalled after a number of worrisome battery fires, while the Mercedes-Benz EQS was recalled for an infotainment snafu. General Motors managed to start delivering the Hummer EV trucks to its first customers, just under the wire. The Tesla Cybertruck was delayed until 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QuDdD8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Then the Mach-E came out, and that was about it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezhRjT"&gt;“It felt like we were setting ourselves up for a big EV year,” said Jessica Caldwell, director of insights at Edmunds. “Then the Mach-E came out, and that was about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0D9mv1"&gt;There have been other setbacks as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791984/ford-rivian-ev-canceled-investment-ipo-jim-farley"&gt;Ford dropped its plans&lt;/a&gt; to make an electric SUV with Rivian and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828360/ford-explorer-ev-aviator-delay-lincoln-mustang-mach-e"&gt;delayed the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its forthcoming electric Explorer SUV to December 2024 at the earliest. The company just stopped taking reservations for the F-150 Lightning as it prepares to launch production of its hotly anticipated electric truck. Experts say more delays could be on the horizon if the pandemic continues to disrupt supply chains and the automotive chip shortage doesn’t improve soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4mKJQ"&gt;Tesla still commands around two-thirds of the EV market in the US, with the Model Y overtaking the Model 3 as the best-selling electric vehicle in the world. The company had some noticeable wins, like a 100,000-vehicle order from Hertz. But it also has stirred up controversy over its rollout of the controversial Full Self-Driving beta software to select customers. For those in the market for a non-Tesla electric vehicle, the options are still pretty slim, Caldwell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3G00w"&gt;“It does feel like this EV market has really been like ‘hurry up and wait’ because there’s a lot of announcements and a lot of talk and yet not a lot in the way of delivery,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CTawZy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It does feel like this EV market has really been like ‘hurry up and wait’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EwXCne"&gt;This is partly because the act of transforming century-old industry is like making a three-point turn in a cruise ship. What’s easy for a startup or even a modest-sized automaker like Tesla is much harder for a 100,000-employee company like GM. These companies have been making internal combustion engines for such a long time, it’s hard to imagine them doing anything different.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gcVpU"&gt;Another reason it’s taking so long to see more EVs is that automakers are shifting away from decades-long practices of outsourcing production work and design to suppliers in favor of a more vertically integrated model of manufacturing, Greenhouse’s Abuelsamid said. In the past, designing and building engines and transmissions was considered a core competency for an automaker. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Herbert Diess, head of Volkswagen Group, speaks at the launch of assembly of the new VW ID.3 electric car in Germany. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9csC8s"&gt;But now, ICE powertrains are at the end of the road, and there’s no more room for improvement, leading automakers and major suppliers to scale back their investments. EV motors and batteries are the new core competency, and automakers want to own the whole supply chain. Ford and GM are both planning massive battery-making facilities in the US. They’re also scrambling to lock down other key materials, like lithium and other rare earth minerals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuvsI3"&gt;“That’s why we are suddenly seeing OEMs take back control of the key components of their next-generation vehicles,” Abuelsamid said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGGHYF"&gt;One of the main lessons automakers took away from the financial collapse of 2008 and subsequent auto bailouts was the need to respond more quickly to shifts in customer demands. And right now, demand for EVs is rising, but skepticism is, too. It’s a weird moment in which customers recognize the environmental and financial benefits of going electric but are unsure they can afford an EV or that the necessary infrastructure exists to support their purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGc1x4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;demand for EVs is rising, but skepticism is, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BUn9WY"&gt;According to a new survey by the Consumer Technology Association, majorities of non-EV owners believe that EVs aren’t reliable (53 percent), are too expensive (64 percent), and that there aren’t enough charging stations to make owning an EV practical (85 percent). On the other hand, EV owners are overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the benefits and reliability of EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8cpPp"&gt;Obviously, this gap will narrow as more people get behind the wheel and see the benefits of EV ownership firsthand, like fewer maintenance needs, more spacious cabins, instant torque, and other attractive features. But that will depend on the auto industry’s ability to make enough electric vehicles to meet this rising demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6pxOj"&gt;To date, every major automaker has unveiled a grand strategy to shift to electric-only or at least electric-majority sales. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;Mercedes are doing it by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;GM by 2040&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/volkswagen-all-electric-ev-europe-us/"&gt;Volkswagen by 2050&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, all of these pledges are just words floating in the ether, and the likelihood that some gasoline-fed vehicles will manage to slip past these deadlines is very high.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXUQ04"&gt;“There are a lot of new challenges for automakers in doing all of this stuff,” Abuelsamid said. “They know how to assemble vehicles, but much of the rest is new and convincing consumers they know what they are doing won’t be easy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9rDRMj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The slow rollout of new EVs gives the false impression that we have time when, in reality, the clock is ticking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zZVhXp"&gt;The slow rollout of new EVs gives the false impression that we have time when, in reality, the clock is ticking. There are roughly 280 million cars and trucks on the road in the US today, only 3 percent of which are electric. Americans typically buy 16–17 million cars every year, which means it will take roughly 16 years of EV-only sales to completely replace all of the gas cars currently on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahQNPn"&gt;Meanwhile, climate change experts insist that we have to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels in order to avoid some of the worst-case scenarios that climate change could create. We’re on track to surpass that in a few decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tASlN2"&gt;Much depends on the speed and efficiency of automakers to churn out electric vehicles  — while the rest of us grapple with the ravages of car dependency. Fewer cars on the road, especially in urban areas where they create congestion and undercut more sustainable modes of transportation, will be essential to fighting climate change. Experts believe that smaller, battery-powered vehicles, like electric bikes, can help pave the way by replacing car trips and making cities more liveable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EioTOa"&gt;But that’s probably not the watershed moment that car companies had in mind. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 was the year platforms came for our ears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfYEAwhs3fNTzOEvIkCWTPRcttM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301241/acastro_181227_3146_podcast_analytics_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZgGj2h"&gt;In 2017, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings infamously told investors his streaming platform not only competes with its counterparts for attention but also with sleep. Now almost five years later, and as the pandemic continues on, our visual attention is maxed out. If you’re not streaming a show, maybe you’re playing a video game, or working, or on a Zoom call. The tech and content platforms of the world realize this, so instead, in 2021, they focused on something other than capturing whatever’s in front of our eyeballs: they came for our ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VeeY3"&gt;Look at who got into audio and podcasting this year. Meta, formerly known as Facebook, a company known for copying any service that takes time away from its own, started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537023/facebook-podcast-rss-feed-publish-clips-pages"&gt;supporting podcasts&lt;/a&gt; on its main app. The impetus? To keep you inside its world and away from competitors, like Spotify or Apple Podcasts, that might capture your free ear attention. Twitter, an app already reliant on you reading it, launched its live audio product Spaces — a way for you to interact without actually having to look at the screen. (Same with any of the live audio launches this year.) Meanwhile, Amazon Music acquired Wondery at the end of 2020 and, this year, launched some of its first, high-profile original shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549391/amazon-music-art19-hosting-platform-advertisers"&gt;acquired hosting platform&lt;/a&gt; Art19, and debuted its first podcast-oriented feature with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22752750/amazon-music-podcast-transcripts-synchronized"&gt;synced transcripts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3P5bA1"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/insider-november-4-2021-amazons-decade-long-podcast-plan/"&gt;a chat with me&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod Insider&lt;/em&gt;, Kintan Brahmbhatt, Amazon Music’s director of podcasts, directly acknowledged the play for attention Amazon is making and the maxed-out screen real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdLS7f"&gt;“Customers have more time for their ears than they do for their eyes,” he said. “If you look at it from a share of attention perspective for customers, we think more and more customers will have more time to listen to things, and podcasts are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLPxCr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; also launched its own audio app in beta with an explicit outline of where it might be able to conquer still-unaccounted-for ear time. The below chart, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arainert/status/1468291125660291074?s=20"&gt;tweeted by&lt;/a&gt; Alex Rainert, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ head of audio product and design, demonstrates the blank spaces the company’s app can occupy — as well as where its competitors hope to dominate. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0uG1kR"&gt;Even video streaming services now recognize the pull of audio in helping it dominate everyone’s time, both visual and audio. Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/netflix-hires-ex-apple-executive-to-lead-podcasting-operations"&gt;made its first&lt;/a&gt; podcast-oriented hires this year, while HBO Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609212/hbo-max-podcast-exclusive-batman-audio-jeffrey-wright"&gt;started distributing&lt;/a&gt; exclusive podcasts directly in its app. YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708688/youtube-music-free-background-listening-date"&gt;started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; free background listening for its Music app and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746466/youtube-podcasting-kai-chuk-amazon-project-mic-live-audio-hot-pod"&gt;hired someone&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to podcasts on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27yMZ3"&gt;Taken altogether, every app now has an audio component that they’ll use to compete with one another for that attention real estate. It makes sense — the biggest tech companies mostly depend on ad revenue, and they’ve put ads everywhere they can. Audio is the newest frontier for them — a fresh place to shove ads and lay claim to more of our time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4FfVs"&gt;I don’t see a reason this strategy wouldn’t work. Presumably, the platforms can turn some portion of the millions of people who don’t already subscribe to podcasts into listeners, and globally, the opportunity is massive. I view this year as one in which the groundwork was laid. Companies were acquired, public statements were made about the power and interest in audio, and during the next one, we’ll see the true marketing and content budgets put to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJGSX1"&gt;Walks, cooking time, and commutes are open for the taking, and looking ahead to 2022, the platforms are hoping they can conquer it all.&lt;/p&gt;
