    <title>DJI releases new flagship Mavic drones — Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BQd9yt"&gt;One of the most anticipated drone releases is finally out. Actually, it’s two drones. Today, DJI has released the Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN7LO3"&gt;There are a few big headline features shared between both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EkBhTx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="DJI_Mavic_3_YTSHORT|104685" data-volume-uuid="6f17a3597" data-volume-id="104685" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-522" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMzAlR"&gt; of the new drones, but let’s start with the one reserved for the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine. The Cine model is capable of filming Apple ProRes 422 HQ footage at 5.1K up to 50FPS, and it has a built-in, but not user-replaceable, 1TB SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okX7Tn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJLDbq"&gt;The cheaper $2,199 Mavic 3 doesn’t come with ProRes or a built-in SSD but shares the same dual-camera system powered by a 4/3 CMOS sensor. Both drones are capable of filming in 4K at up to 120fps and capturing 20MP photos. In addition to the main 24mm lens, there is also a hybrid zoom lens capable of 28x digital zoom. In focal length terms, that equates to 162mm at f/4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0DYLQwUh17DqMllJ_3cUjlErQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983162/DJI_Mavic_3___Canyon___Mountains_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Both drones have the same camera module, except Cine version can shoot 5.1K ProRes video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4p362e"&gt;Both drones have batteries rated for 46 minutes of flight time, which is a significant upgrade over the Mavic 2’s 31-minute battery and even the Mavic Air 2s &amp;amp; 2S, which could fly for 34 and 31 minutes on one charge, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKiG1H"&gt;The two drones are successors to DJI’s Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom released in 2018, which also introduced the first Hasselblad camera to be used in DJI drones after it acquired a majority stake in said company in 2017. But since 2018, we haven’t seen much Hasselblad branding in DJI products — until today. And just like in 2018, DJI is including &lt;em&gt;Hasselblad Natural Color Solution&lt;/em&gt;, which promises incredibly natural colors straight out of its camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZEhyK"&gt;But if you don’t want the built-in color profile, the Mavic 3 is also capable of filming footage in 10-bit D-log for more control over color in post-processing. In addition to ProRes encoding, you can all shoot in standard H.264 and H.265 profiles, but there is no HDR video on this drone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1gPJbh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10844021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vg0o53"&gt;Aside from all the camera improvements, DJI has also upgraded its autonomous features for the Mavic 3. Just like its predecessor, the Mavic 3 also shares omnidirectional obstacle sensing, except the sensors are now capable of detecting objects even 200m (650 feet) away, compared to 20m (65 feet) before. I’ve always found the sensor to be a bit too sensitive, so I’m curious to find out how they act now while near objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzXary"&gt;But that extra reach does enable some new improvements — &lt;em&gt;Advanced RTH &lt;/em&gt;(return to home), APAS 5.0 and ActiveTrack 5.0. Advanced RTH helps the drone plan out a more intelligent route on its way back to the launching position. And the APAS 5.0 does exactly that, except when you’re the one operating the drone. ActiveTrack 5.0, which won’t be available on release, promises great improvement over tracking and following subjects. Such as the ability to fly in any direction while following a subject and taking advantage of visual sensors on the camera body to continue tracking subjects if they go out of frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzvNvrfevY_fTfZEVnI6t6fOvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986400/DJI_Mavic_3___KV_02__desert_standard_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;DJI’s updated ActiveTrack 5.0 promises better autonomous flying and filming&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6oGHkZ"&gt;Both drones also come with updated versions of DJI’s proprietary transmission technology, OcuSync 3+, which promises 15km of range (in ideal conditions) and 1080p at 60fps live feed transmission to your smartphone or controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfZj2G"&gt;If you’re interested in buying this drone, there are three bundles to choose from. The standard version, which includes the drone, carrying strap, remote controller, charger, a set of extra propellers, and a joystick, will cost you $2,199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DonFRT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10846229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BMdw1T"&gt;The Fly More Combo adds two additional batteries, a charging hub, four sets of propellers, a carrying case that also transforms into a backpack, and a set of ND filters (ND4, ND8, ND16 and ND32). The Fly More Combo will cost you $2,999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIKe5i"&gt;And the final bundle is the Cine Premium Combo, which means you won’t be able to buy the Cine version of the Mavic 3 without spending more money on the accessories that come with it — including a completely brand new DJI RC Pro. It’s a remote controller similar to the DJI Smart Controller that features a bright built-in screen. The Cine Premium combo also includes an additional set of ND filters (ND64, ND128, ND256, ND512) that you won’t find in the Fly More Combo. Again, the Cine Premium Combo bundle will cost you $4,999. All three bundles are available to order starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypGQTc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go938h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Instagram and Twitter buried the hatchet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbdLJskWWK1lK-oaSQEvxJOlbAk=/0x0:3188x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096773/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_e04ad522_42a5_43c9_9e1b_3bf39e6953b5_3400x2125.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://unsplash.com/@claybanks" target="_blank"&gt;Clay Banks&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/MQoKGgHZsbs" target="_blank"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rIyzCs"&gt;Today let’s talk about how two of the world’s most important social networks settled an ancient grudge, and what it tells us about the prospects for a more open internet as tech giants work to build a metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKpYeh"&gt;On Wednesday, Instagram &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?s=21"&gt;delivered an announcement nine years in the making&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2012, Instagram photos shared to Twitter have appeared only as plain text links. From now on, Instagram links will include a preview of the image — just as they did before Instagram sold to Facebook, and competitive pressures and professional rivalries combined to worsen our collective user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wB440P"&gt;“They said it would never happen,” Instagram tweeted Wednesday. And indeed, this reversal was one that few saw coming. The path to peace involved wine, pizza, and backyard dealmaking — but to really appreciate what happened, you have to start at the moment everything fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwKG28"&gt;When it launched in October 2010, Instagram was maybe the easiest way to share photos to Twitter. At the time, Twitter couldn’t even host photos itself; you had to post them through third-party services with confidence-inspiring names like Yfrog and Photobucket. Instagram, thanks primarily to its slick filters, quickly became one of the most popular ways to tweet photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suiLl7"&gt;There was also a personal connection between the apps’ founders. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had worked with future Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom at Twitter’s predecessor company, Odeo, and after Instagram launched became one of its most important early supporters. Dorsey regularly tweeted Instagram photos to his large following, and soon he was joined by early-to-Twitter celebrities including Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg. Twitter benefited from the easy photo sharing; Instagram, meanwhile, grew its user base quickly on the back of a feature that let you find your friends from Twitter on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMUoqK"&gt;That all began to change in April 2012, when Facebook bought Instagram for &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/archive/instagram-facebook-price"&gt;$715 million&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter had also tried to buy the company, but lost out to Mark Zuckerberg and his promise to help Systrom and co-founder Mike Krieger reach global scale with minimal interference. Dorsey took the loss personally and stopped posting to Instagram forever. A few months later, Twitter blocked Instagram’s access to its following graph, preventing users from quickly finding their friends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTYm17"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We had some wine, we had some sausages, and then I finally brought it up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JWtJVy"&gt;Then, in December, Facebook &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/"&gt;retaliated&lt;/a&gt;: photos shared from Instagram would no longer appear in the Twitter timeline. As Sarah Frier recounts in her book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Filter-Inside-Story-Instagram-ebook/dp/B07TFB4R2S/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D20985381%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Filter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook executives believed enabling photo previews was only helping Twitter to grow and increase its available ad inventory. And so the company pulled the plug on link previews, and Twitter got so mad about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; that it leaked a story to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; alleging Systrom had perjured himself during the sale to Facebook. (Nothing ever really came of that, aside from bad feelings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxiXJi"&gt;Then nine years went by. Instagram’s co-founders quit Facebook in 2018. By then, Instagram had hit 1 billion users, most of them younger than their counterparts on Facebook. Twitter entered an extended period of stasis that only began to thaw in the past two years, when the company added hundreds of employees and began rapidly shipping new products under head of product Kayvon Beykpour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm0AwV"&gt;Every once in a while, the ban on Twitter link previews would come up internally, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri told me in an interview. Dorsey once sent him a direct message asking if they could work it out. But there were always higher priorities to address, and some lingering competitive concerns. (Twitter and Instagram compete more directly on photo sharing in Japan, for example, he said.) And so nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYl75H"&gt;Twitter, meanwhile, was increasingly open to cross-platform partnerships. It started &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/twitter/"&gt;a popular and hilarious Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546672/twitter-instagram-stories-share-tweets-ios"&gt;enabled the sharing of tweets directly to Instagram stories&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1372614335240007683?s=21"&gt;began embedding YouTube videos directly in tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39ylC5"&gt;I saw a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; story about that last item and, in the obnoxious fashion of many journalists, quote-tweeted it with a mild dunk. “Now do Instagram photos. Thanks!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1372614476780900352?s=21"&gt;I posted in March&lt;/a&gt;. “We’d like to. Takes two to tango,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1372614805857525761?s=21"&gt;Beykpour clapped back&lt;/a&gt;. I tagged in Mosseri and asked if I could interest him in a tango. Mosseri responded with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1372616225788895232?s=21"&gt;a GIF of a man dancing alone in kitchen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLsrdR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now do Instagram photos. Thanks! &lt;a href="https://t.co/K957UcuQWo"&gt;https://t.co/K957UcuQWo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1372614476780900352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bB3XG4"&gt;I then promptly forgot any of this had ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wccu83"&gt;Until yesterday, when Beykpour told me that, improbably, this interaction had somehow triggered a series of events that led to him and Mosseri eating pizza in Bruce Falck’s backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5E0d6y"&gt;“Credit to Adam,” Beykpour told me this week. “When I asked, I had zero expectation that it would happen. Just because, at this point, it’s &lt;em&gt;lore&lt;/em&gt; — like, it was not bound to be, because the gods had forbidden it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uByNlp"&gt;Falck is head of revenue products for Twitter. Before that, he was CEO of an ad tech company called Turn, where he got to know a longtime former employee named Vishal Shah, who left just before Falck took over. Shah went on to become head of product at Instagram; as of August, his title is vice president of metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4roPIr"&gt;After the Twitter tango exchange, Falck reached out to his old friend Shah to see if he and their bosses would be amenable to a parley. It was May, and COVID anxieties in the Bay Area were still simmering. And so instead of meeting at a restaurant, the foursome met up for pizza in Falck’s backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1TIJd"&gt;Beykpour and Mosseri had met in passing before, including once on a plane to South by Southwest. But they had never spent an extended amount of time together until that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbNfHG"&gt;In the end, it was Beykpour who broached the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JDBji"&gt;“We had some wine, we had some sausages, and then I finally brought it up,” Beykpour said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBcpQn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instagram didn’t have a “philosophical” objection to showing photos in the timeline.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lG1FEc"&gt;Mosseri told Beykpour, as he later told me, that Instagram didn’t have a “philosophical” objection to showing photos in the timeline. Rather, it was a matter of freeing up some engineers to work on it. Mosseri said he would look into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt62YM"&gt;In the moment, Beykpour wasn’t sure if he believed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm64Sr"&gt;“We were like, ‘Okay, that’s nice,’” Beykpour said. “And we didn’t expect it was gonna go anywhere. But it did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6iArw"&gt;Unbeknownst to the Twitter team, Mosseri kept a list of what he called “finally features” — stuff that could be built relatively easily that the user base had been clamoring for. It’s the low-hanging fruit of the product world — stuff like letting everyone add links to their stories, a feature Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748303/instagram-link-stickers-stories-everyone-rolling-out-test"&gt;shipped last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8CAA6"&gt;“They’re not really a priority to the company strategically, but sometimes you’ve just gotta make time for that kind of work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWC7Qo"&gt;Back at his home office, Mosseri said he had only two real questions about switching link previews back on. One, would it create a competitive risk to Instagram? And two, would it create value for the user base?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvHTEo"&gt;In the end, he wasn’t confident he would be able to measure either risk accurately. But it seemed like users would like it, he said, and so he peeled off a couple engineers to start testing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HjVUJ"&gt;“You know what, why not just do a little bit more of what people are asking for,” he remembers himself thinking. “It seems like a good thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gyoSt"&gt;Testing took a couple months, but by this week it was ready. Beykpour told me he was grateful to Mosseri for working with Twitter — even if he’s already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1455966879168688134?s=20"&gt;needling&lt;/a&gt; his rival in the hopes of getting Instagram to adopt &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; image previews, rather than small ones. (Developers get to choose which of Twitter’s embed formats they use; when I asked Mosseri about it, he said Instagram was just “starting small.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BDPLB"&gt;Meanwhile, Mosseri recently held a hackathon to work on more “finally features,” some of which will be shipping soon. (An iPad app is not among them, he volunteered before I could ask.) And he seemed to be enjoying the newfound spirit of goodwill with Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wd1eYk"&gt;“I think it’s good to bury old hatchets,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOEaeV"&gt;Particularly given his parent company’s ambitious to build a world in which companies are much more integrated than they are today — a goal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;shared with me&lt;/a&gt; in announcing the company’s pivot to the metaverse this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eevEw8"&gt;“More and more, platforms are going to need to figure out how to be more open,” Mosseri said. “And that’s tricky. Data portability has huge privacy implications. I think we need to figure that out as an industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12Swnu"&gt;In the end, though, the only thing thing that was truly needed to end the Instagram-Twitter feud was time — and a willingness to put users’ needs ahead of strategic anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFexsm"&gt;“People don’t live on one product,” Beykpour said, noting the Twitter had also launched an integration with Snapchat last December. “They’re navigating in between them. So making those making those traversals feel convenient and colorful, I think, is important.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brembo’s ‘intelligent’ brake system could apply pressure to each wheel individually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LV0f3hAapNMUCiz4LOVkqQzhrs4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096345/SENSIFY_BREMBO_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Brembo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zqMwi"&gt;High-end Italian brake manufacturer Brembo &lt;a href="https://www.brembo.com/en/ComunicatiStampa/2021/20211025_PR_Brembo_Unveils_ENG.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in October its plan to release Sensify, an AI-enhanced braking system that promises both “driving pleasure and total safety” when it rolls out via an unnamed manufacturer in 2024. Going beyond anti-lock brakes, traction, and stability control, it replaces hydraulic controls with electronic ones for design flexibility and, potentially, more precise control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK6gZu"&gt;Incorporating AI into vehicles isn’t new, as algorithms control playlists, maps, driver assistance, and even “self-driving” to various degrees. AI-based brake systems, however, are enough to raise eyebrows about how exactly they will work or enhance safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raZ6NN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re only as good as the training data you have”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5mACbq"&gt;“As you start to deal with artificial intelligence and neural networks, they’re only as good as the training data you have,” said J. Christian Gerdes, an engineering professor and co-director of the Center of Automotive Research at Stanford University. “If you have a new case that represents something it hasn’t seen before, it’s hard to know in advance what it decides to do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tFkHg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry-news-tech,-development-and-manufacturing/brembo-sensify-revolutionary-new-ai"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autocar UK&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Sensify is using a “dedicated app” to program itself based on data and enhance the driving experience. The system supposedly will use predictive algorithms, sensors, and data management tools that give it a “digital brain” capable of controlling each wheel independently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tt3H06"&gt;Gerdes says that modern anti-lock brake systems, first introduced in the 1970s, are a Band-Aid for wheels locking up under heavy braking. “What would make more sense is to have an understanding of what’s going on at each of your wheels. And to then intelligently ask for brake force at different wheels.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Brembo Sensify system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HevVSV"&gt;Despite the digital footprint with AI and Sensify, the physical mechanics have more of a presence compared to the software in the Sensify system, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/brembo-eyes-startup-deals-software-takes-bigger-role-brakes-2021-10-25/"&gt;according to Brembo chief executive Daniele Schillaci&lt;/a&gt;. The exec told &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;“the mechanic and software contents will soon be equivalent and by the end of the decade software will become predominant in braking systems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce9huo"&gt;The company plans to open a technology lab in Silicon Valley by the end of the year to further its digital strategies. Brembo says, “Data collection is leveraged to improve the driver experience and allows the system to be constantly updated,” but how it will handle questions like privacy and security of that collected data is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfSICM"&gt;One of Sensify’s benefits is adapting to driving styles, adjusting to weather and road conditions, and shorter locking times. Brembo also says its system will be cheaper over the life of a car because it removes brake fluid by adding electromechanical control, has lower maintenance costs, lower disc consumption, and lower or zero drag torque. In an electric or hybrid vehicle, better control of regenerative braking can help reduce the battery size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrCkoe"&gt;What happens when there is a hardware failure in that AI brain? In &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry-news-tech,-development-and-manufacturing/brembo-sensify-revolutionary-new-ai"&gt;a demo for &lt;em&gt;Autocar UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Brembo explained the system has two ECUs (electronic control units) that are connected as a fail-safe but send their commands separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es67ej"&gt;The system is set to be released in 2024. Brembo said that it’s designed to work on multiple car types like sedans, racecars, SUVs, and commercial vehicles, but it’s not clear how much it needs to be customized for each type.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements break Face ID unless you can microsolder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Em6G6QkVUlMXgnMLI0x9rZq4sSY=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096270/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNvSN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 lineup might pack a lot of new features, but they now have a major restriction that makes it much harder for independent repair shops to replace broken screens. If you try to swap the screen, Face ID just won’t work — that is, unless you know how to microsolder and can successfully move a tiny microcontroller from the original screen to a new one, as detailed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22764251%2Fiphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPfobS"&gt;The change makes a very common replacement much more difficult for independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a significant part of their business. Authorized Apple shops apparently don’t run into the problem, as they have access to software that “can make an iPhone 13 accept a new screen with a few clicks,” according to &lt;em&gt;iFixit.&lt;/em&gt; But many indie shops aren’t part of Apple’s official Independent Repair Provider program, which reportedly has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;invasive terms&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them to have to try and find a way to repair iPhone screens on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUwr1"&gt;If you want to see just how involved the microcontroller switch is, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from iCorrect. The repair is a multi-stage process that looks to take some time and require special equipment. And it’s almost certainly impossible for most iPhone owners to try it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rni2SA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9MXlhsThmM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WmnXtR"&gt;Apple has steadily been pushing people away from repairs done by indie shops through ominous warnings shown after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;battery swaps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;screen replacements&lt;/a&gt; for some iPhones. But the situation with Face ID breaking on an iPhone 13 means that people who want a screen repair don’t have many great options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu0v2F"&gt;An authorized repair &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;can be expensive&lt;/a&gt;, as is paying for AppleCare Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone/"&gt;reduced screen repair prices&lt;/a&gt;. But when the alternatives include finding an indie shop that has the capability to pull off the delicate microcontroller swap, getting a screen replacement but sacrificing Face ID, or just living with a broken screen, paying up for an authorized repair might feel like the best option, even if it is the worst for your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFfgB9"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber prices are still way up, so the company is bringing back carpooling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber and Lyft sign in windshield of car, Queens, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w53xIiLeEaXKnbZ6HbgYN0jT3t0=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096233/1310967778.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXDYIM"&gt;Uber is preparing to relaunch its carpooling service as a way to combat price increases, officials said in a call with investors. Uber Pool was shuttered in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and remained so even as vaccines became widely available and customers returned to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk8K6U"&gt;But that could soon change, according to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who hinted that a new shared rides product could be released soon. Along with its rival Lyft, Uber has been struggling to recover from the pandemic, as drivers fled the platform, wait times increased, and the cost of rides soared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJHwj"&gt;“We are launching an Uber shared pool product,” Khosrowshahi said. “We have been investing for years in a high-capacity product, which is looking more and more attractive as it relates to a unit economic basis, where that can bring the price significantly lower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XvMe5I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber’s prices are up 20 percent compared to last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRT2NX"&gt;Uber’s prices are up 20 percent compared to last year, slightly less than they were over the summer but still relatively steep compared to pre-pandemic prices. Introducing a low-cost carpooling service will help ease the demand for Uber’s main ride-hailing products, and hopefully bring those prices down more, Khosrowshahi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZhhyE"&gt;Uber Pool, the service that matches up to three riders in one car based on their destinations, was one of the cheapest options on the company’s platform. But drivers hated it, complaining about low customer ratings, an inefficient algorithm, and roundabout directions that tend to annoy riders despite the low fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmEa2f"&gt;COVID-19 put a halt to the practice of strangers sharing the backseat of a car. Cities like New York actually banned shared trips in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Lyft also suspended its Lyft Line carpooling service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gk4kWV"&gt;When Uber Pool comes back, it may look different than the pre-pandemic version. Khosrowshahi hinted that it could be more like an employee shuttle service using Uber’s matching technology that the company can sell to its corporate client. A spokesperson called the employee shuttle a “separate effort” from the carpooling service, but declined to share more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HCQxd"&gt;That likely won’t affect the price of an Uber ride in the near term, though. Khosrowshahi acknowledged that the company is currently involved in “a giant pricing experiment that no one wanted to get into.” The company will continue to struggle with supply and demand problems as the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGb1Km"&gt;But Uber reported that its Q3 gross bookings, or the amount of money it takes in before paying drivers, reached an all-time high of $23.1 billion, up 57 percent year over year, despite a 20 percent increase in prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj9Rcy"&gt;“We’re seeing that as cities reopened, people start using the product,” Khosrowshahi said, “and they use our product a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City’s mayor-elect says he wants to be paid in Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmGpDd0fTNB9k2CA2GXRG96opZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096108/jbareham_180313_1777_bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfwR7l"&gt;New York City’s mayor-elect Eric Adams &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that he wants his first three city paychecks paid in Bitcoin, in a bid to show up the mayor of Miami and indicate his hopes that New York will be a place where the cryptocurrency industry is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rABvl"&gt;To put it lightly, the feasibility of Adams &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;getting paid in Bitcoin seems dicey. (Is the city’s payroll even set up for that? How will this work with the fluctuating price of Bitcoin? My goodness, what’s the &lt;em&gt;tax&lt;/em&gt; situation going to be like?) Whether it actually happens or not, though, he’s sending a clear message about his intended plans as a mayor — you probably wouldn’t say something like that if you’re going to ignore cryptocurrency and Bitcoin completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sxreEQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In New York we always go big, so I’m going to take my first THREE paychecks in Bitcoin when I become mayor. NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry and other fast-growing, innovative industries! Just wait!&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NZD4jo"&gt;As one of my colleagues noted in Slack, the move is part of a (crypto) wallet-measuring contest with the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez — Adams’ tweet was in response to Suarez saying that he’d take his next paycheck in Bitcoin, and he threw in a remark about New York going big (hence the three paychecks, because three &amp;gt; one). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQTtSM"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/new-york-mayor-elect-eric-adams-to-take-first-3-paychecks-in-bitcoin.html"&gt;CNBC points out&lt;/a&gt;, both mayors are trying to make their cities the center of the decentralized currency space. Adams has promised to look into what’s slowing down crypto investment in New York, and Suarez has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/30/crypto-miamicoin/"&gt;given support to a project called MiamiCoin&lt;/a&gt; that lets people invest crypto into the city. Suarez also said that he hopes the city’s payroll and taxes could one day be paid in Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6olxc"&gt;Culturally speaking, Miami has a head start: Blockchain.com &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crypto-company-blockchaincom-moves-us-headquarters-to-miami-301304969.html"&gt;moved its US operations from New York to Miami earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and El Salvador’s president announced that the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526808/el-salvador-bitcoin-currency-first-country-cryptocurrency"&gt;would be adopting Bitcoin as an official currency&lt;/a&gt; at a Miami conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fvi5i"&gt;As with any political promises or stunts, actions speak much, much louder than words. Adams actually getting a few paychecks in Bitcoin (or getting paid in dollars and immediately converting them into crypto, which would be much easier) won’t really move the needle on the industry. But the fact that he and another prominent mayor are talking about doing it shows a big shift in how (at least some) leaders are thinking about the future of money.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian accused of ‘toxic bro culture’ in gender discrimination lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_Y0I68lTpknNaP6WKav_-oiEd4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095963/mclark_210923_4776_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MGjZE"&gt;EV startup Rivian’s former sales and marketing vice president has sued the Amazon-backed company for discrimination, claiming it has a “toxic bro culture that marginalizes women.” The suit, first &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-rivian-executive-sues-for-gender-discrimination-ahead-of-ipo-11636054512?st=ucjb0mosprg2pju&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;comes just days before Rivian is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;become a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, and a few weeks after it started delivering its first electric vehicles to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UyVRH"&gt;Laura Schwab, the former VP, says she was fired last month after alerting a human resources executive about discrimination. She sued the company Thursday in Orange County Superior Court, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, though the complaint was not publicly available at the time this article was published. Scwhab also published &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@lauraschwab1/life-outside-the-boys-club-why-i-spoke-up-about-rivians-toxic-bro-culture-and-got-fired-15600b999ae7"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday titled “Life Outside the Boys Club: Why I Spoke Up About Rivian’s Toxic Bro Culture (and Got Fired).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Up9hM"&gt;A spokesperson for Rivian declined to comment, citing the mandatory quiet period in the run-up to the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="318d"&gt;Schwab has spent two decades in the automotive industry and joined Rivian in November 2020. She says in the blog post that she was “excited to join a company that was building a brand and its planet-minded vehicles from the ground up &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that led every conversation with the importance of company culture.” But while Rivian “publicly boasts about [that] culture,” Schwab writes that “it was a crushing blow when I joined the company and almost immediately experienced a toxic bro culture that marginalizes women and contributes to the company making mistakes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hWXFjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“dominated by men at the top”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Un6IVx"&gt;Scwab says she “raised concerns to HR about the gender discrimination from my manager, the ‘boys club’ culture, and the impact it was having on me, my team, and the company.” She was fired two days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hICjw"&gt;Rivian is “dominated by men at the top,” and CEO RJ Scaringe “surrounded himself with a tight knit group of men who constantly had his ear,” Scwhab says. She says she made suggestions about the company’s business plan that got shot down, only to watch the men at the top ultimately accept the same ideas pitched by male colleagues. “Never in my years in the auto industry had I experienced such blatant marginalization,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4836t"&gt;Schwab said she tried to raise these issues with her boss, Rivian’s chief commercial officer, but that she was unable to schedule a meeting with him. She also says she was starting to get left out of other planning meetings. When she asked another female senior executive to help include her, her colleague “informed me that she &lt;em&gt;was also excluded&lt;/em&gt; from these meetings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2E9NL"&gt;“It is unbelievable that two high-level female executives would be left out of these meetings directly impacting their work,” she writes. “This was not the culture that Rivian prided itself on, and I realized that to change it I needed to raise my voice.” After speaking to HR, Schwab says the chief commercial officer finally scheduled a meeting with her, only to fire her. He claimed it was part of a “reorganization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4hIaj"&gt;Scwhab’s account of her time with Rivian comes as employees across the tech industry have been speaking out with greater volume and frequency. Apple employees have spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;organizing and bringing to light stories about harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. A whistleblower at Facebook recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;gave documents to reporters around the world&lt;/a&gt;, and to Congress, after speaking up internally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRmA3H"&gt;Former Pinterest employee Ifeoma Ozoma kicked off a reckoning within that company in 2020 by sharing her own experience with racial discrimination and has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711694/pinterest-whistleblower-ifeoma-ozoma-tech-worker-handbook"&gt;launched the Tech Worker Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to guide employees who want to speak out about wrongdoing. Pinterest also settled a gender discrimination suit with its former chief operating officer in late 2020. That former executive was represented by the same firm that has taken up Scwhab’s case, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di6oew"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taika Waititi is making a movie based on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s The Incal comics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hunt For The Wilderpeople" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_Hu_HiKG9ElmzSjK077UzEhf9A=/248x0:1400x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095918/WaititiWilderpeople.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2EVUdI"&gt;Taika Waititi is set to co-write and direct an adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Incal&lt;/em&gt;, the sci-fi graphic novel from writer Alejandro Jodorowsky with art by Jean Giraud, better known as Moebius, according to a report &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/incal-movietaika-waititi-to-direct-1235041908/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFuDL3"&gt;Jodorowsky’s name has been a popular one in Hollywood recently due to the release of the latest incarnation of &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. Jodorowsky was famously working on a surreal and bizarre adaptation of the novel (alongside Moebius and H.R. Giger), but unfortunately was never able to get any major studios to take the risk on his idea. The journey of that process has since been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/14/5410996/jodorowskys-dune-documentary-trailer-adaptation-that-never-was"&gt;its own documentary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jodorowsky’s Dune. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kTYi5a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the greatest sci-fi film never made","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/27/5554126/jodorowskys-dune-interview-greatest-sci-fi-film-never-made"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pVlvDL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Incal &lt;/em&gt;is also just the first work in a series of connected comics that Jodorowsky wrote (referred to as the Jodoverse), which could see the upcoming film be the start of the kind of long-running franchise that Hollywood has been chasing since the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SutBF"&gt;“The films and graphic novels of Alejandro Jodorowsky have influenced me and so many others for so long. I was stunned to be given the opportunity to bring his iconic characters to life and I am grateful to Alejandro, Fabrice and everyone at Humanoids for trusting me to do so,” Waititi commented in a statement to &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXsU4M"&gt;The project is just one of several for the busy Waititi, who’s also currently working on the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; (out July 8th), &lt;em&gt;Next Goal Wins &lt;/em&gt;(a movie about the American Samoan soccer team’s attempt to qualify for the 2004 World Cup), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246620/new-star-wars-movie-taika-waititi-disney-plus-series-leslye-headland"&gt;a currently untitled &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://movieweb.com/akira-movie-release-date-canceled/"&gt;on-hold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18638777/akira-live-action-taika-waititi-thor-ragnarok-warner-bros-release-date"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Akira &lt;/em&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt;, a film sequel to &lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/flash-gordon-film-taika-waititi-live-action"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash Gordon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remake, and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/03/taika-waititi-netflix-animated-series-roald-dahl-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-oompa-loompas-1202875032/"&gt;two animated Roald Dahl shows&lt;/a&gt; for Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro says the chip shortage won’t affect holiday sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_0d6axqPQczxL3pqD_HAuJmIrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095787/bfarsace_210909_4746_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9B6sv"&gt;GoPro &lt;a href="https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/GoPro-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the global chip and other supply chain shortages won’t affect its holiday sales this year, meaning the action camera company is poised to finish one of its best years in recent memory in strong fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5jhL8"&gt;“Despite supply chain constraints that are affecting many industries, we have successfully partnered with our suppliers to produce inventory to support our fourth-quarter revenue expectations,” CEO Nick Woodman said while &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001500435/000150043521000065/gpro2021-09x30exh992xer.htm"&gt;discussing the company’s third-quarter financial results on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. “GoPro.com and our retail partners will be stocked and ready for shoppers this holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLfdGb"&gt;That’s especially good news for GoPro’s bottom line because the new Hero10 Black is selling incredibly well despite the higher $499 price tag. GoPro said Thursday that 98 percent of the roughly 800,000 cameras it sold in the third quarter were at or above the $300 price tag — up from 83 percent in the third quarter of 2020. The average sale price for cameras in the quarter was $381, up 25 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zZyJIM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The GoPro Hero10: small step for the Hero10, big leap for GoPro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bD4oaZ"&gt;GoPro has also been increasingly shifting to a direct-sales model over the last few years — nearly a third of its revenue this past quarter came from sales on GoPro.com — which means it’s making more on every camera sold. The company said Thursday that it booked $14 million in revenue this past quarter for its subscription service, too, which now has over 1.34 million customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfoyaW"&gt;All that adds up to the company’s best third quarter since 2017. GoPro booked $317 million in revenue and about $49 million in profit. (The company reported a quarterly profit of $312 million, though $263 million of that was attributed to a wonky deferred tax situation.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkoOha"&gt;GoPro’s best quarter every year, though, is the final one. The holiday season has always been kind to the camera company, even in its darkest years. With the Hero 10 Black already doing well and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20954058/gopro-q3-earnings-hero-8-black-sales-figures-revenue"&gt;memories of layoffs and failed products getting fuzzier&lt;/a&gt;, it could turn out to be one of the company’s biggest quarters since its blockbuster holiday season in 2014 — which was when it broke into the mainstream with the Hero4 cameras. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will start phasing out mask requirements for US retail store customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-grsg9Sg0X49OeTVZzFNyDnb4QQ=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095412/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0ozwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning to begin ending mask requirements for customers at some of its US retail stores as early as Friday (via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;). The company told employees about the change in an internal memo on Thursday,&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, saying the decision was based on a decline in coronavirus cases and a rise in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVxdeW"&gt;Like many companies with multiple locations, Apple has changed its masking requirements for customers more than once since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year. In March 2020, the company closed most of its retail stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;as the virus spread&lt;/a&gt;. It began reopening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;some US stores in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with many offering only curbside service and not allowing customers inside. Most stores that did open to customers conducted temperature checks and required customers and employees to wear masks. Apple began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopening all its US retail stores in March 2021&lt;/a&gt; as vaccines became more widely available and eased mask requirements for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;customers in June&lt;/a&gt; as vaccination rates began to rise, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;reinstate them in July&lt;/a&gt; as COVID-19 cases surged once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESRxKQ"&gt;The latest memo states that the updated mask policy will apply to retail customers at more than 100 of Apple’s 270 US stores and will be the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated customers. Mask requirements for Apple retail employees will remain in place, however, and will continue for customers in areas where local governments still require indoor masking. The company added that it will “continue to monitor local guidance and Covid data” throughout the coming holiday season and adjust as conditions warrant, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAiyqz"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
