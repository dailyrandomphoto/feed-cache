    <title>Just over a week after relaunching verification, Twitter is pausing verification</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mh1Gv_Qb6LuWKdDOkJgP3IN6Xz4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358462/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBHGFv"&gt;Twitter relaunched its verification program last week, allowing anyone to apply for a blue check mark, but the company is pausing accepting new applications because of the volume of applications it has already received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXbiSm"&gt;“We’re rolling in verification requests,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1398359044054790153"&gt;the company said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “So we gotta hit pause on accepting any more for now while we review the ones that have been submitted. We’ll reopen requests soon! (we pinky swear)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zfg4G7"&gt;When it officially opened the program for applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;on May 20th&lt;/a&gt;, the company cautioned that the timeline for requests could stretch out. “Once you submit your application, you can expect an emailed response from us within a few days, but this could take up to a few weeks depending on how many open applications are in our queue,” &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/relaunching-verification-and-whats-next.html"&gt;Twitter said in a blog&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that the volume of applications has already become so large that Twitter has made the choice to pause applications entirely, just eight days after the program reopened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0BcYi"&gt;With the new program (when it’s open, that is), anyone can apply to receive the coveted blue check, so it’s not altogether surprising that there have been an overwhelming number of applications. Under the new guidelines, six categories of accounts can qualify for verification: government; companies, brands, and organizations; news organizations and journalists; entertainment; sports and gaming; and activists, organizers, and other influential individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lbiGF"&gt;Twitter previously suspended the verification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; after it verified the account of a white supremacist. The company went back to the drawing board on its verification policies, introducing the new ones &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes’ lawyers want to know how often jurors blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF7pwmjZAwGWxaH3pTnkOwpwD7k=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358241/1316519218.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nhat V. Meyer/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5V2Q1v"&gt;The lawyers of Elizabeth Holmes, ex-CEO of disgraced blood testing startup Theranos, have 112 questions for prospective jurors at Holmes’ fraud trial — including how often they check social media and whether they subscribe to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP9YdM"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-has-over-100-questions-for-jurors-11622217048"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes’ attorneys have just filed a proposed jury questionnaire for her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/30/20532321/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-blood-testing-startup-trial-date-set-august-2020"&gt;upcoming fraud trial&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; detailed &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.327949/gov.uscourts.cand.327949.808.0.pdf"&gt;45-page document&lt;/a&gt; outlines every possible way Holmes fears a jury could be biased, and part of that apparently involves gauging &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how online each juror is. Among other questions, jurors are asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BSHsSI"&gt;“Do you have an account on any social media platforms? If yes, please identify the platform(s).”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xPBBEr"&gt;“How frequently do you use the platform(s) listed above?” (Answers range from “multiple times per day” to “almost never.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z38lzu"&gt;“How do you use social media? (for example, communicate with friends; express opinions; follow current events; etc.)”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S266WD"&gt;“Do you belong to any groups on social media (ex. Facebook or WhatsApp groups)?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jE8V10"&gt;“Have you ever posted messages, comments, or opinions on websites/social media, or blogged? If yes, please describe the websites or social media platforms that you have used; the types of things you have posted or blogged; and how often you have done it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="P09Hqw"&gt;The questionnaire underscores the sheer breadth of media coverage around Theranos, with numerous questions gauging how (and how much) jurors engage with media. On the more general side, that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="04CE5G"&gt;“Have you ever written a letter to the editor or called into a radio show?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zz6Jzm"&gt;“How much in the news media do you believe is fair and accurate?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GyNKLj"&gt;Then it asks whether potential jurors read, watch, or listen to any of 46 text news outlets, 15 individual media figures, and 19 video or audio outlets — mostly news stations, but also Hulu, Netflix, and HBO. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is not named on the questionnaire, although fellow Vox Media outlets &lt;em&gt;Vox &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; are.) That’s on top of questions about whether the jurors have consumed media about Holmes and Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfOsvy"&gt;By contrast, US prosecutors — who filed their own &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.327949/gov.uscourts.cand.327949.802.0.pdf"&gt;51-question proposal&lt;/a&gt; yesterday — asked participants to list their “main sources of news” and if they follow “financial news” specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XELVMy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prosecutors called the questionnaire “deeply intrusive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bGP5YD"&gt;Prosecutors called Holmes’ form “far too long, deeply intrusive in unnecessary ways, argumentative, and repetitive” in a court filing. Beyond the social media questions, the form asks jurors to specify things like whether any family members or close acquaintances have experience with 26 different professional fields and government agencies. But Holmes’ lawyers claimed the entrepreneur was “routinely referred to in derisive and inflammatory terms,” making the questions pertinent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKDOJK"&gt;That’s not an unfair description of Holmes’ media portrayal, although getting rich off &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline"&gt;a medical device that doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt; is arguably worthy of derision. It’s also a little ironic, because news outlets &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-media-emperors-new-startup"&gt;were once criticized&lt;/a&gt; for hyping Theranos without sufficient fact-checking. As Holmes’ filing notes, however, Theranos’ fall is now chronicled in a well-known book (&lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt; by John Carreyrou), documentary (HBO’s &lt;em&gt;The Inventor&lt;/em&gt;), and multiple podcasts (Tyler Shultz’s &lt;em&gt;Thicker Than Water&lt;/em&gt; and Rebecca Jarvis’ &lt;em&gt;The Dropout&lt;/em&gt;), plus an &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/amanda-seyfried-elizabeth-holmes-the-dropout-hulu-theranos-kate-mckinnon-1234723500/"&gt;upcoming Hulu miniseries&lt;/a&gt; starring Amanda Seyfried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UczcO6"&gt;Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17469310/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-biotechnology-health-science"&gt;indicted for fraud in 2018&lt;/a&gt; alongside former Theranos president and COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. Her trial is scheduled to begin in August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media companies, here are some free theme park ideas to comply with Florida’s deplatforming law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jyy04e6kVIm8Wkok7W66nWMfKTY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358239/VRG_4607_Social_Media_Land.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWpPS8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is deeply invested in doing service journalism; we report on companies’ misdeeds, we review expensive products to tell you whether they’re worth your hard-earned money, and speak to industry leaders to get their insights on the issues affecting their companies and their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeY1a9"&gt;It is in that vein that we brainstormed some ideas for social media theme parks in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIFb0v"&gt;See, the Sunshine State &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451425/florida-social-media-moderation-facebook-twitter-deplatforming"&gt;passed a law this week&lt;/a&gt; that blocks social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter from “knowingly” deplatforming politicians and even algorithmically ranking content, with fine ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per day (The law, which is a mish-mash of broad speech regulations, has already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457200/ccia-netchoice-lawsuit-florida-social-media-law-unconstitutional"&gt;challenged in court&lt;/a&gt; by the tech companies’ trade organizations, which called it “a frontal assault on the First Amendment.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3EIuO"&gt;But there’s an easier way. The law has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;hilariously corrupt exemption&lt;/a&gt; for any company that owns or operates a theme park or large entertainment complex in the state of Florida. Republican state Rep. Blaise Ingoglia said that exemption was included so that the Disney Plus streaming service “isn’t caught up in this.” The Disney World park in Orlando brings in &lt;a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2020/07/09/disney-reopening-slow-step-toward-new-normal"&gt;significant tax revenue&lt;/a&gt; for Florida, of course, a state which relies heavily on tourism dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxTwcW"&gt;So all Twitter, Facebook, TikTok et al have to do to comply with the law and avoid the knotty First Amendment issue of government speech regulations is build their own Floridian theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8maKXE"&gt;Here are our suggestions for the parks including some ideas for appropriately themed rides that the venues might offer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622212334.352700"&gt;Twitterland&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wgt0Z3"&gt;Has a secret nightclub called Slides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9OlVHG"&gt;Sells drinks called Canoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6RrZSl"&gt;The Ratio is a dunk tank where you get dropped into water for your bad takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="htDiXK"&gt;Whac-A-Mole is instead Block-A-Troll &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FmyJ1N"&gt;A water-themed ride where you’re sailing along and random guys try to pull you into the water: Reply Guys, the ride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="arFkYD"&gt;Rollercoaster goes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/actioncookbook/status/684515262712967170?s=20"&gt;sideways&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QWLqX7"&gt;The only problem with Twitterland is that it keeps opening amazing rides and then letting them completely fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D3yiBL"&gt;Facebook World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vW5oGV"&gt;All the rides suddenly pivot to video without warning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622212441.356000"&gt;A haunted house attraction called Facebook Moderation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nOqeZg"&gt;Instagram and WhatsApp once had separate parks, but they have been annexed into the main Facebook park and turned into shopping malls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="esmcgR"&gt;The water park has a slide into radicalism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xkD4vH"&gt;If you get detained by security, they put you in the Racist Uncle Time Out Room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vyf9im"&gt;An Instagram hall of mirrors that features mirrors that give you an Insta-ready body with lighting made for photos and then leaves you feeling terrible when you come to the last mirror, which has heavy shadows for lighting and no body editing whatsoever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622212517.357100"&gt;TikTokLand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CHLJkK"&gt;A hall of mirrors that shunts you through random rides with absolutely no information or warning, gradually tuning your experience using the sophisticated biometric monitor in your admission wristband&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JOEJyQ"&gt;Alternately, the whole park is just the set from the Weeknd’s Super Bowl halftime show where a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458399/the-backyardigans-viral-tiktok-castaways-music-youtube"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; song&lt;/a&gt; plays on a loop &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xqjWIK"&gt;Pinterest Park &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NERDoG"&gt;It’s just a bunch of themed photo booths that produce those little photo strips, but you have to wait in line and read 200 words before you can ride the Recipe Rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HM6oc3"&gt;The GooglePlusPlex&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vt32lV"&gt;A giant haunted house which closed eight years ago but high school kids still break into at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMfU3F"&gt;The entire park littered with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;discontinued Google products&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MNTgPi"&gt;Clubhouse Clubhouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wqwIbM"&gt;It’s just one big infinity room where you enter and hear men talking at you and over each other about Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622213410.363500"&gt;Reddit Faire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9TvYRT"&gt;A Renaissance fair that ended up sharing its property lease with a prison, thanks to an awkward misunderstanding in the C-suite. Many guests are incredibly devoted cosplayers in delightful historically accurate costumes. Many are petty criminals. A few are serial killers. Try to guess which ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEvviy"&gt;YouTubeLand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="l6Q0E6"&gt;Has a ride where you appear to climb higher and higher forever, but then perilously fall to Earth after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256087/james-charles-youtube-instant-influencer-apology-video-drama-controversy"&gt;botched apology&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2lRyI4"&gt;To enter the park you have to smash the like button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CtCdE7"&gt;The Thumbnail Ride promises nonstop conflict but is really just a pretty chill afternoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PwVRvO"&gt;Every ride is at least 10 minutes long so it can include a midroll break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZI81RR"&gt;If you make a wrong turn at the bathrooms, you’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/8/16751206/elsagate-youtube-kids-creepy-conspiracy-theory"&gt;occasionally run into&lt;/a&gt; an off-brand superhero ride that ends in a spike pit. No one knows who paid for or designed these rides, but children find them inexplicably compelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4FOIlP"&gt;You can’t leave unless you ring a bell, and then you will be sent notifications reminding you to return to YouTubeLand for the rest of your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZySsa5"&gt;Really big and expensive and in many ways the gold standard for all the other parks, but no one appears to be in charge at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4yfzHl"&gt;Snapchat Studios&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wgi5zU"&gt;Rides disappear after you go on them once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bltjTQ"&gt;All the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13584488/snapchat-snap-inc-spectacles-vending-machine-snapbot-available"&gt;vending machines sell Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;, but no one buys them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0s9m6c"&gt;Unfortunately the park’s been kind of struggling because all its best rides get cloned by Facebook World within six months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sedEd3"&gt;Temporarily closed because it accidentally opened another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296713/snapchat-juneteenth-filter-smile-chains-controversial"&gt;racist&lt;/a&gt; ride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622213891.363900"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622214213.365300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why on Earth did Amazon spend $8 billion on a zombie studio? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MGM Studios" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zvdshbq6IYPUDooiiscDkaeUfLY=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358186/1231823071.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFgIrJ"&gt;Amazon just dumped an $8 billion-plus chunk of change on MGM, a studio best known for James Bond and its logo of a roaring lion. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; offers an opportunity for Amazon to spin the spy films into a big perk for its streaming services. But it’s hard to believe that dropping billions for the studio’s content library is actually going to prop up Amazon’s streaming services — at least on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BQVX4"&gt;Amazon already has a fully functioning &lt;a href="https://studios.amazon.com/"&gt;studio arm&lt;/a&gt; that produces content for its Prime Video service. While it’s got a few hits here and there — &lt;em&gt;Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt; immediately comes to mind — Amazon has, for the most part, struggled to reach the &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;-level of viewer enthusiasm that its rivals often enjoy. The company also owns IMDb TV, a free and ad-supported streaming service that’s actually pretty decent. Some of the service’s content is a little dated, but most of the curation feels fairly solid as far as pay-nothing title selections go. Still, Amazon could use a considerable content overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6YhD6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s going to seem like an idiot move in about five years.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gWvZdW"&gt;MGM brings a significant haul of quality cinema to the table, even if much of it is older. The studio’s library includes the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legally Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rocky&lt;/em&gt; franchises, which isn’t nothing. It also owns a huge back catalog of series and films that include &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Addams Family &lt;/em&gt;animated film, &lt;em&gt;Candyman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Creed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt;. Amazon said it plans to “reimagine” these titles, which sounds like spinoffs and remakes. “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP,” Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5fSyT"&gt;But while, yes, there’s IP, it’s unclear how valuable it all really is. Many of MGM’s largest franchise properties are dated, and it &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/amazon-buy-mgm-studio-james-bond-shark-tank-77914593#:~:text=Long%20up%20for%20sale%2C%20MGM's,ultimate%20control%20over%20the%20franchise."&gt;doesn’t even fully own&lt;/a&gt; the rights to &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt;, its crown jewel. Plus, many of MGM’s legacy titles like &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt;, for example, aren’t owned by the studio anymore. (Warner Bros. actually now &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/wizard-oz"&gt;owns the rights&lt;/a&gt; to the iconic film.) MGM, while certainly iconic, is far from a top-tier studio churning out genre-bending contemporary films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UfGCd"&gt;“It feels like they’re following a playbook from five years ago,” Katharine Trendacosta, associate director of policy and activism at Electronic Frontier Foundation, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by phone. Of the $8 billion price tag, Trendacosta said, “it’s going to seem like an idiot move in about five years — because that’s not actually what the value of any of this stuff is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLUOvL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhUkGe"&gt;That IP playbook — the one that landed HBO in its current brand identity crisis under AT&amp;amp;T’s direction — has left scraps as far as studios go. The playbook Amazon and other services are pulling from seems to simply point to snapping up as much content as possible for their respective services. But Amazon, and other service-oriented companies for that matter, are now picking over bones. The company can certainly afford to drop billions on IP acquisitions for its services. But at this point, nobody can compete with what Disney’s been building for the better part of two decades. And as Trendacosta pointed out, “we’re rapidly running out of studios.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qgabm4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every entertainment [property] is now a streaming service, which means they think of themselves as tech companies — which is incorrect.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2jufsF"&gt;Nearly a decade ago, Disney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3577656/disney-buys-lucasfilm-plans-to-release-star-wars-episode-7-in-2015"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; Lucasfilm — the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films — for just over $4 billion. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/business/media/01disney.html"&gt;few years prior&lt;/a&gt; to the Lucasfilm deal, the company paid about the same to snap up Marvel. In 2006, the company paid a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/disney-to-buy-pixar-for-74-billion.html"&gt;little over $7 billion&lt;/a&gt; to acquire Pixar. Sure, none of these deals were conducted amid what is arguably the peak of streaming’s popularity. But even accounting for the streaming bubble we’re currently in and the value of franchise IP for luring potential subscribers, the MGM deal still feels a little like a ripoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi659x"&gt;“Hollywood has picked up Silicon Valley disease, even though by this point, we should know that doesn’t work,” Trendacosta said. “Every entertainment [property] is now a streaming service, which means they think of themselves as tech companies — which is incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFMnmY"&gt;Trendacosta added that these services are all acting on a four-step business model: acquire IP, make as many things as possible, insert question mark here, and reach profitability. But that works only in the instance that the grand plan is to be acquired. For smaller services like Discovery Plus or even Peacock, that makes sense. There are simply far too many streaming services. Those little services won’t be able to compete with the bigger players forever, and we’re likely to see more mergers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;the one we just saw&lt;/a&gt; with WarnerMedia and Discovery. But what comes next is unclear, particularly for mega-services. Right now, it very much feels like mega-services are just collecting spare parts, and that’s to say nothing of brand identity confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3yZgc"&gt;“Who’s going to buy any of these places? No one. They’re already large,” Trendacosta said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKw8Gm"&gt;Now, that’s not to say that there’s no value at all in the deal. Amazon can certainly bank on opportunities to spin out any of the legacy franchises it acquired — much in the same way that rival services do to boost subscriber growth. Disney has done this with &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; on Disney Plus, and CBS has done the same with &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt; on Paramount Plus (formerly CBS All Access). But &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; value do those spinoffs add for Amazon? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Oc7r"&gt;“You’re talking about overreaching and overpaying, which Amazon can do,” Jeff Bock, senior media analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations Co., told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview by phone. “It doesn’t really hurt their bottom line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4XwI3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re talking about overreaching and overpaying, which Amazon can do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXZkdL"&gt;By Bock’s estimation, such a move to acquire the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; IP, for example, could be a vertical integration play should Amazon eventually decide to invest in theaters — something that probably sounds ludicrous before you remember that Amazon owns Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDfRHk"&gt;“Is it possible — and everybody here at least in LA thinks so — that they may be one of the bidders on the ArcLight Cinemas or Cinerama Dome?” Bock added. “If they see bookstores in the same way and they see grocery marts in the same way, what’s to stop them from going brick and mortar and buying theaters, eventually, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFXCVP"&gt;That may be especially true of the future of the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; franchise. Whereas MGM was putting out a &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; film every few years, Amazon could begin to churn them out every one or two years, Bock speculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiHySw"&gt;Ultimately, it’s too soon to say for certain what Amazon plans to do with its shiny new box of legacy classics. It’s entirely possible Amazon will release any forthcoming titles exclusively on Amazon, opt for theatrical releases, or do some combination of both. But whether its $8 billion investment will prove valuable is very much yet to be seen. And on its own, it’s hard to believe that the MGM acquisition will make Prime Video a serious Netflix competitor in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch warns streamers another wave of copyright strikes is coming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kLw43B24Xf6m8_LWSyXS3YRK-NM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357719/acastro_190812_1777_twitch_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FMLK4H"&gt;Twitch has received a “batch” of new takedown notices from music publishers over copyrighted songs in recorded streams (known as VODs), the company said in an email to streamers today. The notice may be worrying for some streamers who were affected by the waves of takedowns that hit last year, because if a user gets three copyright strikes on their channel, they will be permanently banned from the platform, according to Twitch’s policies. With this advance warning, it seems Twitch is trying to get ahead of a sudden flurry of takedowns and give streamers some time to remove potentially offending VODs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49EQjd"&gt;“We recently received a batch of DMCA takedown notifications with about 1,000 individual claims from music publishers,” Twitch said in an email Friday, which was sent to a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer. “All of the claims are for VODs, and the vast majority target streamers listening to background music while playing video games or IRL streaming.” Twitch believes the notifications were automated and warns more are likely coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96hfo7"&gt;If you’ve bounced around Twitch streams before, you’ve probably heard music in the background of many of them. A lot of that music is copyrighted, which leads to situations like these mass takedowns when the music industry wants to get paid. In Friday’s email, Twitch noted that the only way to avoid DMCA (or Digital Millennium Copyright Act) strikes is to not stream copyrighted material in the first place, and said that if a streamer does have unauthorized content in their VODs or clips, “we strongly recommend that you permanently delete anything that contains that material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eIVQRk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DMCA takedowns first became a major Twitch issue last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xebZ0g"&gt;DMCA takedowns first became a major issue for streamers last year. In May, many streamers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284287/twitch-dmca-copyright-takedowns-clips-controversy-broken-system"&gt;were blindsided&lt;/a&gt; by sudden takedown requests, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-notices-riaa-copyright"&gt;and in October&lt;/a&gt;, following another wave of copyright notices, Twitch took the step of deleting offending content. At the time, Twitch offered limited tools to streamers to manage content in response to the takedowns, compounding the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWPxab"&gt;The company apologized for how it handled the situations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560913/twitch-streamers-dmca-copyright-tools-apology"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it received a significantly higher number of music-related DMCA notifications starting last May than it ever had before. The company also promised to release better tools to help streamers manage their old content, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335929/twitch-dmca-vod-mass-delete-copyright-strike-dmca"&gt;followed through on that promise in March&lt;/a&gt;. And for streamers who want to play rights-cleared music in the background of their streams, Twitch offers a product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495243/twitch-soundtrack-streaming-music-soundcloud-distrokid-facebook-gaming"&gt;called Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, which it released worldwide in beta &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/09/30/introducing-soundtrack-by-twitch-rights-cleared-music-for-all-twitch-creators/"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Memorial Day sales happening now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGSdFyIHYKHdYolpTFgi2Bb_6A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357654/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Our favorite smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 6, is $70 off at multiple retailers this weekend. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCrwEW"&gt;Memorial Day weekend has officially arrived. Numerous retailers, including GameStop and Walmart, have already kicked off their Memorial Day sales online, offering customers a chance to save on a variety of electronics ahead of the three-day weekend. The holiday remains a great way to save on mattresses and camping equipment — it’s the unofficial start to summer, after all — but if you’re a gamer or prefer electronics over home goods, there are plenty of bargains to be had on headphones, TVs, and games throughout the long weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4MxBJ"&gt;We’ve seen discounts on many of these items before, sure, but if you’re still looking for a good deal, it’s hard to go wrong with the highlights below. Also, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; now reportedly set for June 21st and 22nd (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there’s a good chance some of these items may make a return in the near future. Then again, no promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="taWXMw"&gt;Headphone deals&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Cybertruck patent applications show off UI, solar bed cover, ‘armor glass’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kF8tgyWg-e7z4VuMBVkfuwxmV5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357449/sokane_191112_3807_8517.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6T8gkP"&gt;New patent applications submitted by Tesla in 2020 but published Thursday have revealed a bit more information about the Cybertruck, which is currently slated to start shipping at the very end of this year or in early 2022. One includes (in rather grainy detail) a bunch of screenshots of the new UI Tesla has been working on. Another details how the company plans to integrate solar panel tech onto the retracting tonneau cover for the truck bed — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-solar-roof-option-add-range/"&gt;something CEO Elon Musk said might be an option&lt;/a&gt;. And there even appears to be an application for what could be Tesla’s so-called “armor glass,” which memorably failed during an onstage demo in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui8Xpc"&gt;We’ve seen glimpses of Tesla’s new user interface before, at the Cybertruck reveal event and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/28/tesla-head-ui-leaves-leaks-unreleased-cybertruck-fsd-images/"&gt;when the company’s head of UI left earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20210156705.PGNR."&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546177/cybertruck_ui.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) — which has to do with how the UI will change in different situations — shows off how Tesla may ultimately display some features specific to the Cybertruck. For instance, one screen shows what the Cybertruck’s screen may look like when you’re trying to hook up a trailer to the tow hitch. A more off-road focused screen shows the truck’s real-time pitch and roll. A new “Today” screen shows a split-window view of a calendar, a “news” section, and other UI elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hb8hLm"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fW1bfB"&gt;The solar tonneau cover &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20210155086.PGNR."&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546168/cybertruck_tonneau_cover.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), meanwhile, offers a helpful side view of exactly how Tesla plans to roll the thing up when the bed is open, as well as how the sections will connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwTpnW"&gt;The most curious one may be the “durable glass for vehicle” &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20210154980.PGNR."&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546163/cybertruck_glass.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), though. While Tesla filed it on the same day as these other Cybertruck patent applications, it doesn’t explicitly mention the truck, and instead includes an image of a more generic Tesla vehicle. That said, one of the inventors is engineer Rosie Mottsmith, who originally helped develop the “armor glass” &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-engineer-shares-why-she-destroys-things-for-work-2018-2"&gt;for Tesla’s Semi truck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9oYsn"&gt;The application describes something that sounds similar to Corning’s Gorilla Glass. Tesla describes a glass comprised of three layers — an outer one, an inner one, and an adhesive interlayer. The external layer is 2mm to 5mm thick and made of borosilicate. The internal layer is 0.5mm to 1.1mm thick and is made of aluminosilicate. Corning uses both materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVwGvi"&gt;Tesla says the goal is to give the resulting glass sandwich “at most a 10% chance of failure with an impact of 2 J.” In a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546210/CGG_PI_Sheet_Interior_Architecture.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; describing an older spec of Gorilla Glass, Corning rates a 1.5mm thick piece failing at an impact of about 3.5 J. It achieved that by dropping a half-kilo steel ball. Now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation"&gt;where have I heard that before&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Backyardigans are going viral on TikTok and it’s about time </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IrXMElfOVaxwaPE4v5XyZxhNjQg=/84x0:996x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69357207/backyardigans.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Uniqua, Pablo, Tasha, Tyrone, and Austin, The Backyardigans | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Backyardigans-Season-3/dp/B001V52RZE" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="whLQfu"&gt;When you are a parent, you quickly learn that your kids will inevitably get into shows or videos or learn songs that slowly chip away at your sanity because you will hear them over and over and over. Anyone who knows what “Baby Shark” is will know exactly the kind of hellscape I’m talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMKOoe"&gt;But once in a while, a kids’ show comes into your family’s life and you miss it when your kid ages out of it — like &lt;em&gt;Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;. For our family, that show was &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt;; my now-teenager voraciously watched episodes of the show that ran on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013 (we watched the DVDs), and would actually get up and dance when the music started. We looked forward to new episodes about the hijinks of Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin, because each episode had a different musical theme, with original songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQIKea"&gt;Two favorites were the Motown-themed “News Flash”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with a song about corn that I still hear whenever someone mentions the vegetable, and “Catch That Butterfly” which was basically a Rodgers-and-Hammerstein-themed operetta.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lhLWu"&gt;So the newfound appreciation for one &lt;em&gt;Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; song in particular that has taken over a corner of TikTok makes me extremely happy and renewed my belief that Gen Z is the best generation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ea08e"&gt;It started with Merlysha Pierre, 19, of Miami, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/backyardigans-tiktok-castaway"&gt;who told &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@swagsurfff/"&gt;started posting TikTok videos&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans &lt;/em&gt;because she was concerned that younger kids didn’t know about the show or its songs. One of the songs she posted was about the bossa-nova-themed “Castaways,” which inspired many other TikTokers to do their own versions, leading to the song &lt;em&gt;charting on Spotify&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chartdata/status/1394627160233676800?s=20"&gt;going number one on its global viral chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buXSff"&gt;“Castaways” also caught the eye of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkp4xDOwqqJD7sSM3xdUiQ"&gt;music theory YouTuber Adam Neely&lt;/a&gt;, who gave a little &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2007/tv/news/the-backyardiga-21849/"&gt;backstory about just how much&lt;/a&gt; went into each &lt;em&gt;Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; episode, from hiring musicians and dancers (honestly, I had an inkling that every episode of this show had to be a major production in its own right but no idea just how major) and broke down “Castaways” as a piece of music, calling it a masterpiece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1yQh9a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uVAGjfFmFkw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epPsxj"&gt;Every episode of &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; had a Pablo freak-out (he was arguably the show’s main character), and each one of the characters got to “star” in an episode from time to time and deal with a problem they were struggling with in “real” life through play (and song). The predictability was soothing and the show wasn’t preachy. It was also fun to watch because the writers included plenty of inside jokes for the parents tuning in — we usually watched an episode pre-bedtime when my son was little, and it was extremely pleasant to drift off to whatever the kids were singing about that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpPnPV"&gt;Director Barry Jenkins also recently discovered &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt;, giving his thoughts in this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BarryJenkins/status/1391266842589626373?s=20"&gt;very sweet Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; about the show. He wished a happy Mother’s Day to the show’s creator &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janice_Burgess"&gt;Janice Burgess&lt;/a&gt; (truly, a hero. Also a Pittsburgher!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k3XczB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy Mother's Day to Janice Burgess, award-winning creator of the wonderful BACKYARDIGANS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know whether Ms. Burgess has children of her own, but she very clearly helped raised a whole lotta y'all's kids with this most fantastic show, so... a salute to her   &lt;a href="https://t.co/96ZqvUrjX6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/96ZqvUrjX6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Barry Jenkins (@BarryJenkins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BarryJenkins/status/1391472006420328450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YwdhuF"&gt;So now, a six-year-old song from a children’s show is making the rounds once again, which is adorable and amazing. I may dust off the DVD player this weekend and watch a few episodes for a good Mom Cry; it looks like the show is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Backyardigans-Season-3/dp/B001V52RZE?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-backyardigans%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458399%2Fthe-backyardigans-viral-tiktok-castaways-music-youtube" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streaming on Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you’re not as old-school as me and prefer a slightly more modern experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlnT4H"&gt;In any event, I hope all this renewed appreciation for &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; leads to a new generation of kids discovering the depth and charm of a show about five kid friends (a penguin, a moose, a hippo, a kangaroo, and a Uniqua) who played in the backyard and sang songs and did dances until it was snack time. &lt;em&gt;The Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; is a nice respite for kids of any age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEcw0T"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Mars helicopter had a midair brain fart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/26xJkzEBZJ8zkzjxcvSXWJWVxIo=/0x25:640x452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69356609/May_28_2021_09_27_54.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tr7jo4"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter ended its sixth flight test on Mars earlier than planned last week after bugging out mid-flight, the rotorcraft’s chief pilot wrote in a blog post on Thursday. The four-pound mini helicopter was aiming to fly farther than any of its previous excursions to test out its scientific reconnaissance capabilities, as the latest trial in an extended test campaign to demonstrate a new mode of transportation on another world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHMm0"&gt;Last Saturday, Ingenuity powered up and rose 33 feet from the Martian surface to travel a distance of roughly two football fields along a preprogramed flight path, all the while snapping photos of a “region of interest” on Mars during flight. As it buzzed along at about nine miles per hour toward the end of the first 150-meter leg of its journey, a glitch in the helicopter’s navigation unit caused Ingenuity to suddenly lurch midair. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MrdGXfU3iAhuez1l4j1PRbt8hLI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545709/May_28_2021_09_24_37.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video from Ingenuity’s navigation camera shows the wobbling caused by a glitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bWNzxW"&gt;It was a “stressful flight” for the little copter, Håvard Grip, the chief pilot, said. “Ingenuity began adjusting its velocity and tilting back and forth in an oscillating pattern,” rattled over what Grip said were “phantom errors” that caused “roll and pitch excursions of more than 20 degrees, large control inputs, and spikes in power consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xj2zdfBxPrsStr_5-R4F34J5OkU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545713/May_28_2021_09_27_54.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingenuity lands safely after a stressful flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q2jamx"&gt;Ingenuity’s sense of movement comes from two vital parts of its internal computer, stored in its tissue box-sized body that hangs underneath its twin-rotor system. The first part is an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that tracks how fast the rotor blades spin to calculate acceleration, which enables estimates of its speed, midair position, and location (relative to its starting point). The second instrument is a tiny, ground-facing, black-and-white camera that snaps 30 photos per second to give the helicopter a visual sense of where it is, tracking rocks and patterns on the ground as Ingenuity zips by. Those photos come with timestamps, so Ingenuity can precisely analyze movement over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52rGRy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We designed Ingenuity to tolerate significant errors without becoming unstable, including errors in timing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ojW72"&gt;All of that data converges in the helicopter’s navigation system to provide a sense of balance and awareness. Ingenuity’s flub occurred 54 seconds into flight when one of the black-and-white navigation images randomly disappeared, knocking the image pipeline out of order and rendering the timestamps on all subsequent images inaccurate. “From this point on, each time the navigation algorithm performed a correction based on a navigation image, it was operating on the basis of incorrect information about when the image was taken,” Grip explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3d1iH"&gt;The spoiled navigation data misled Ingenuity to believe it was making a series of flight errors, prompting harried attempts to overcorrect itself before a safety system kicked in to guide it calmly back to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zwRxjI1zcvrwBn9FPl1E6zRas00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545722/PIA24600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite the glitch, Ingenuity captured this west-facing image 33 feet above the Martian surface as planned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ddVFQe"&gt;Ingenuity landed safely about 16 feet from its intended touchdown spot, partly because the helicopter’s navigation unit is designed to ignore navigation images during the landing process, when it nears altitudes of around three feet. Relying only on data from the IMU, none of the images with glitch-inducing timestamps affected Ingenuity’s landing. “We designed Ingenuity to tolerate significant errors without becoming unstable, including errors in timing,” Grip said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A21eI9"&gt;The helicopter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; on the Red Planet attached to the underbelly of NASA’s Perseverance rover, which landed at Mars’ Jezero Crater, a dried-out lake bed, on February 18th. Perseverance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt; Ingenuity on the Martian surface on April 4th, leaving it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;carry out the first powered flight&lt;/a&gt; on another world on April 19th. Just after its fourth flight, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412154/nasa-ingenuity-aces-fourth-flight-mars-advance-new-testing"&gt;opted to extend Ingenuity’s flight campaign&lt;/a&gt;, impressed with the helicopter’s stability and performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="po5GEl"&gt;A JPL spokesman said engineers are reviewing data from Ingenuity’s sixth flight and don’t yet know when it will carry out its seventh.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The places paving the way to 100 percent renewable energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Burlington, Vermont, Church Street downtown with restaurants and tourists" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/le-uriuEe9ejVUM-MhnMYyi2wXo=/75x0:5025x3300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69356527/558218703.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Burlington, Vermont has been running on renewable electricity since 2014&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L8h0xD"&gt;Shortly before Darren Springer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;interviewed for a job at the Burlington Electric Department (BED) in 2016, the city proudly &lt;a href="https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/2016_pmr_vfr.pdf"&gt;proclaimed&lt;/a&gt; that it would become a “net zero energy city” by 2030. That meant no more gas or oil to heat residents’ homes and swapping out gas-powered cars for electric vehicles and more public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="h8rvfl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s got to be one of the most ambitious goals anywhere”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GxQneH"&gt;“I said, that’s got to be one of the most ambitious goals anywhere in the country,” Springer, who is now BED’s general manager, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That was one of the things that drew me to this work at Burlington Electric.” Since then, he’s worked to get the city on track to meet that goal. And while the target might have been unheard of in 2016, it’s now just one early example of the splashy renewable energy aspirations that more and more governments seem to be dreaming up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXuDsH"&gt;As of September 2020, 452 cities and 22 regions had &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/news/commitments-to-net-zero-double-in-less-than-a-year"&gt;made commitments&lt;/a&gt; to slash and offset their planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions, reaching net-zero CO2 pollution by the middle of the century. It’s all part of a race to stop the worst effects of climate change from becoming reality, which scientists say requires the entire world to nearly completely gut greenhouse gas emissions by that deadline.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0e78A"&gt;President Joe Biden is setting the US on a path to run entirely on clean electricity by 2035. That’s not an easy target, considering renewables only make up about 20 percent of the country’s power mix today. Luckily, Biden, and other state and city leaders with similar aims, have roadmaps from communities like Burlington, Vermont that are already ahead. The city offers a glimpse into what a clean energy future might look like for the rest of the nation, what it might take to get there, and which potential pitfalls it would be best to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H84EJk"&gt;“Having such an ambitious goal encourages creativity and innovation because you have to find ways to scale up, to pilot different approaches, to try something [and] fail in some cases, and then evolve your approach,” Springer says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIVjCU"&gt;The city has largely tried to get its residents on board with its clean energy plans through carrots rather than regulatory sticks. It’s focused on incentives, like rebates for residents who install energy-efficient heat pumps. City leaders have gotten some &lt;a href="https://www.wcax.com/2020/12/11/burlington-city-council-push-to-reduce-fossil-fuels-and-turn-to-electric/"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; for tougher stances, like when the City Council proposed a change to Burlington’s city charter that would allow it to impart an “impact” fee on homes and buildings that still rely on fossil fuels for heating. Voters ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.burlingtonvt.gov/sites/default/files/Election%20Results%20-%20Questions%20SIGNED_1.pdf"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the measure this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Vermont Voters Prepare To Vote In Super Tuesday Primary" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m4ekScRUCIaS6m90F2UfSz7t3LI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544469/1209971135.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burlington, Vermont – March 2nd: A “VOTE HERE Tuesday” sign is placed outside Burlington Electric Department March 2nd, 2020 in Burlington, Vermont. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vCHRYk"&gt;Voters will have to approve proposed fees again if the charter change is approved by the state legislature. But if they do, it shows some of the distinct advantages the city has that helped it turn to renewable energy so early. Its residents, city leaders, and a local utility all aligned on environmental efforts. Since the 1960s, people have flocked to Vermont in search of an alternative way of life — often escaping big cities or looking for greener living. One of its most famous transplants is Green New Deal champion Senator Bernie Sanders, who moved there from New York City in 1964 and eventually served as Burlington’s mayor throughout the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4u8bG"&gt;“Environmental leadership began in the late ‘80s, and we have really been able to sustain that,” says current Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger. “You need just two things if you want to do this: you need the political will to forge this kind of climate emergency progress. And then secondly, you do need technical proficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZMoKHK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You need just two things if you want to do this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gm8sAM"&gt;For Burlington, its municipally owned utility is the technical arm fulfilling much of the political leadership’s aims on climate change. It was founded more than 100 years ago after residents got fed up with high rates from the previous privately owned utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSC3aE"&gt;“Burlington had a long history of local control, local management … People in the city are involved and know where their energy comes from,” says Jennie Stephens, director of Northeastern University’s School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs. “That is something that’s unique, that not all communities and cities have, that allows Burlington to be really creative and innovative early on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bstyUY"&gt;Today, the city’s control over the utility makes it much easier to enact changes without facing a power struggle. The city essentially manages everything from energy generation to distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAKSgy"&gt;For cities that get their power from investor-owned utilities, she says, “it’s this whole complicated, constant negotiation with the utility … the tendency with a lot of these organizations is to try to keep everything the same, because it’s worked and they’ve been making money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lp4S2D"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A beautiful dam day &lt;a href="https://t.co/QZOaoPcDIf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QZOaoPcDIf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Winooski Dam (@winooskidam) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/winooskidam/status/1003378675461578759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBg4GO"&gt;One of the biggest advantages for Burlington is that they have easy access to both water and wood. Over 30 percent of Burlington’s electricity comes from burning wood, much of it waste leftover from the region’s logging industry. Another 40 percent comes from hydropower, which made Burlington the first city to run on 100 percent renewable electricity in 2014. Wind provides another 25 percent. Just over 1 percent of Burlington’s electricity came from solar last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCintT"&gt;The city’s reliance on wood and water allows it to sidestep some of the infrastructure headaches that can come with solar and wind. Electricity grids were built to facilitate a constant flow of energy from fossil-fueled power plants. Those old grids don’t currently have the storage — aka batteries — built in to store energy for use when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine. Burning wood and spinning water turbines also generates a constant flow of energy, making it more compatible with the existing grid. Nationally, the transition to clean energy is going to require &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419206/smart-grid-renewable-energy-power-sector"&gt;a major grid upgrade to accommodate more intermittent sources of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8WuWF"&gt;Burning wood and damming up waterways have a smaller impact on the climate than fossil fuels. But they’re also more controversial than solar or wind. Larger, older dams are notorious for wrecking ecosystems. Wood-burning, meanwhile, comes with other pollutants that can affect air quality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ka21V5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cities looking to make renewable energy goals will need to find their own balance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvRBZ1"&gt;“It’s a balancing of different factors, you know. We want renewable energy, we want to mitigate impacts from different projects,” says Springer. “From all of the different literature that we’ve looked at, it’s far more beneficial to have renewables than to use fossil fuels.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vy1bI0"&gt;Cities looking to make renewable energy goals will need to find their own balance. They’ll also have to take into account who might be bearing the burdens of that transition whether it’s air pollution from burning biomass like wood, or some households seeing higher electricity bills from utilities shouldering the costs of building new energy infrastructure. “This transformation is an opportunity to invest in people and communities in very different ways. And it’s also a real risk if we don’t,” Stephens says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTjDMG"&gt;There’s been a reckoning within the mainstream environmental movement to ensure that the benefits of clean energy are felt equally, and that low-income households aren’t disproportionately saddled with the costs and burdens of an energy transition. Stephens points to New York state as a good example of finding equitable solutions: it plans to reach &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/6/20/18691058/new-york-green-new-deal-climate-change-cuomo"&gt;100 percent clean electricity by 2040&lt;/a&gt; and stipulated that 35 to 40 percent of the benefits from new climate and energy policy go to disadvantaged communities. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation is developing a 34-acre “regenerative community” on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lsfz7W4Garjeu-FyKQJ-IoRIrpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545628/TV_Drone_Site.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation is developing a 34-acre “regenerative community” on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jqMa5S"&gt;Moving beyond Burlington, there are more grassroots efforts to build equitable, green energy infrastructure. The nonprofit, Indigenous-led Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation is developing what it calls a “net-zero energy” community for members of the Oglala Lakota Nation on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. The goal is for the 34-acre development’s power to come completely from renewable energy, for now primarily solar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYrsQe"&gt;At the moment, the homes, apartment buildings, and community center that are part of the development still only get about half their power from solar. They haven’t been able to figure out the intermittency problem yet with solar, and batteries are still too costly. (Thunder Valley has also had setbacks from more extreme weather, like baseball-sized hail that actually broke through solar panels last year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbabG5"&gt;Thunder Valley recently put out a request for proposals on how to get its development the rest of the way to its goal. And in the meantime, it’s leaned on traditional building styles to make structures more energy efficient, like including large south-facing doors that allow more sunlight into homes to heat floors. Similar to Burlington, another strength is how involved residents are in crafting how the development progresses, says Chance Renville, a project manager at Thunder Valley. “Tribal members are really the designers and the ones shaping and making this place what it is,” says Renville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PtPNxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tribal members are really the designers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AOBX3f"&gt;“We’ve lived in harmony with Mother Earth for generations, and more recently we have gotten away from that,” says Renville. “But I think it’s important for us to really take a look at what we’re doing and how we can get back to living more sustainably.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfYj6Z"&gt;There’s no one-size-fits-all plan for moving communities to a more sustainable future. Communities and leaders will have to take stock of the strengths and resources each community already has — whether that’s traditional knowledge, strong civic participation, or existing policies and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bmM39J"&gt;“There are just so many good reasons to have an ambitious goal and to strive for it, even if it requires trial and error,” Burlington’s Springer says. “Even if it feels at first that it might be more than is achievable, I think we’re trying to prove that it can be achievable.” &lt;/p&gt;
