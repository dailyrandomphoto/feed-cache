    <title>Is Microsoft building a gaming monopoly?</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7NzFjZ"&gt;Yesterday morning, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;announced plans to acquire&lt;/a&gt; Activision Blizzard, publisher of games ranging from the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series to &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;, for $68.7 billion. Microsoft says the move would make it the third-largest gaming company by revenue, following Tencent and Sony. The company, already a giant in the market, would gain even more leverage over how games are made and distributed. That’s assuming regulators approve it — something that’s not guaranteed amid a new push for scrutiny of potential tech monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQmt5C"&gt;After a damaging antitrust case in the 1990s, Microsoft has mostly escaped the more recent antitrust criticism directed at tech companies like Apple, Meta, and Amazon. But the company has been steadily building its power in the games world for the past few years. In 2021, it closed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;an acquisition of ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt;, giving it ownership of subsidiaries like &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; maker Bethesda Softworks for a total of 23 first-party game studios. Meanwhile, Microsoft has built its Xbox brand into a gaming service that spans both consoles and PCs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22406059/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-25-million-microsoft-activision"&gt;The company recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; that its Xbox Game Pass subscription service had grown to 25 million subscribers after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15684972/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscription-launch-date"&gt;launching in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. With the Activision Blizzard acquisition, it would integrate a massive game publisher into that system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ob8dYn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft has budgeted time for heavy scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ov4d1c"&gt;That new market power could raise eyebrows at the US Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which will have to approve the merger. While neither agency has commented on the recent announcement, they’ve committed to more carefully examining tech industry consolidation — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889579/ftc-justice-department-lina-khan-kanter-google-facebook-amazon-antitrust"&gt;launching a joint process yesterday&lt;/a&gt; to start overhauling the approval process. Expecting resistance, Microsoft has budgeted an extended timeline for the process, planning for it to close by the fiscal year of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lJZ7Z"&gt;Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard fits the form of a vertical merger: where two companies that offer complementary services combine forces, like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17152518/att-time-warner-merger-trial-justice-department"&gt;major telecommunications company buying a media production company&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, it’s a major game studio joining a major game storefront and console company. (Since Microsoft already owns several first-party game studios, there’s also a level of horizontal merger, where directly competing companies combine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LOSYr"&gt;The new generation of antitrust activists has recently taken particular aim at vertical mergers. In September of last year, the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-moves-toward-stricter-antitrust-scrutiny-of-vertical-mergers-11631741589"&gt;withdrew Trump administration-era guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that agency chair Lina Khan said wrongly attributed helpful effects like increased efficiency to them — calling claims that they provided consumer benefits “misguided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUqgoy"&gt;A video game industry merger might not seem as immediately dangerous as something like a sprawling Amazon retail monopoly or a locked-up mobile app store. But Microsoft’s growing power in games could reduce its incentive to work fairly with third-party developers who rely on products like the Xbox and Game Pass to reach players. It could also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890553/microsoft-activision-xbox-game-pass-competition-subscription"&gt;increase the dominance of Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; and its leverage to raise prices on subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMwICJ"&gt;“It’s all about the Game Pass subscription model,” explains Matt Stoller of the American Economic Liberties Project. “Everyone who doesn’t own massive distribution is going to have an increasingly difficult time producing games and getting them distributed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQm2uG"&gt;Stoller believes there’s a precedent for blocking Microsoft’s merger as anti-competitive. He cites &lt;em&gt;United States v. Paramount Pictures&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-day-the-supreme-court-killed-hollywoods-studio-system"&gt;a landmark 1948 Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; that took aim at Hollywood studios’ control over the distribution of movies &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the theaters where they were shown. The resulting consent decree barred studios from also owning theaters and imposed other restrictions like an end to “block booking,” which forced theaters to book slates of films in advance. (The decree was &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/judge-agrees-end-paramount-consent-decrees-1306387/"&gt;officially terminated in 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a judge determined it was “unlikely” the studios would wield the same monopoly power today.) The &lt;em&gt;Paramount&lt;/em&gt; decision “created an open market for creative content,” says Stoller — it’s credited with helping fuel the rise of television and freeing actors from restrictive contracts by reducing studios’ power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veUfF9"&gt;Stoller sees Paramount-like consolidation today in games. “What you’re finding here is that it was an open market for gaming content, but it’s increasingly being closed off into walled gardens,” he says — although he acknowledges that companies like Nintendo have long maintained closed ecosystems. The recent rise of game streaming, a system where companies can exercise even more control over how content is distributed and played, could further consolidate the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOXmtr"&gt;“Game streaming giants will make it much harder for independent game producers to get into the market,” warns Stoller. And Microsoft is one of the biggest players in that space thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;cross-platform Xbox Cloud Gaming&lt;/a&gt; (formerly xCloud) service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rd1INw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One lawmaker has cited “encouraging” signs from Microsoft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbDheC"&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean that regulators — or lawmakers who have expressed a broad interest in tightening the rules for mergers — will be hostile to Microsoft’s merger. The company’s acquisition of ZeniMax didn’t meet substantial resistance in either Europe or the US — although the latter was then still operating under Trump’s administration, which put less weight on antitrust. Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22561157/ken-buck-antitrust-apple-amazon-facebook-google-cicilline-jim-jordan"&gt;prominent Republican supporter&lt;/a&gt; of antitrust reform, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1483564026919596032"&gt;tweeted yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that he’d received “encouraging” assurances from Microsoft that the deal wouldn’t decrease competition. “They’ve suggested that they’re going to emphasize access to titles and competition in the marketplace as well as the individual gaming experience,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1483564029293600776"&gt;Buck said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx3TY7"&gt;Buck’s comment hits on one of the key splits in recent antitrust debates: whether anti-monopoly efforts should focus narrowly on the direct effects on consumers or the market as a whole. As Khan has noted, combining two complementary services &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;necessarily grant benefits to end users. But even if it does, it could have ripple effects that change the way games are made and played, putting more pressure on developers to play by Microsoft’s rules. And in an era of renewed suspicion of monopolies, that might raise more red flags than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s faster C-band 5G is live and off to a promising start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klCou6FBnhd32v1B4r5jzh36x3U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408396/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vXuyvi"&gt;Amid an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;ongoing tussle with the FAA&lt;/a&gt; and airline industry, Verizon today flipped the switch on its mid-band 5G deployment, which uses spectrum that the company spent tens of billions of dollars to acquire in the C-band auction. The new, faster level of 5G connectivity will significantly augment Verizon’s “5G Ultra Wideband” network, which, until now, has relied solely on extremely-fast-but-very-hard-to-find millimeter wave spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZWFbT"&gt;Mid-band 5G overcomes many of the hurdles that have made mmW the brunt of jokes from competitors like T-Mobile: it’s actually available indoors, and coverage doesn’t vary as unpredictably from one street to the next. Customers with compatible phones should experience noticeably faster data speeds compared to Verizon’s “5G Nationwide” network that offers widespread signal but with download and upload performance that in many cases isn’t much better than LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqM4F"&gt;In short, 5G is about to feel a lot more real for Verizon customers than it ever has before. Mid-band is a crucial element of Verizon’s long-term 5G ambitions and bridges the gap between the slow 5G Nationwide and barely existent, ultra-fast millimeter wave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpCLCi"&gt;Even on day one, the improvements are promising. Customers were quick to take to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon"&gt;the Verizon subreddit&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday to post a slew of Ookla Speedtest screenshots, with download rates regularly topping 600Mbps and even 800Mbps in some cases. Many are seeing an average downlink between 300 and 400Mbps, far exceeding the performance of 5G Nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5dJeat"&gt;Which devices support Verizon’s new, faster C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiwHtD"&gt;At launch, the list of supported phones and tablets is fairly short. These are the devices that can already connect to Verizon’s C-band 5G:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nyTl9H"&gt;Apple iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tgp345"&gt;Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), or iPad mini (6th generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dUkQZr"&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j7667Y"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, S21 Ultra, Z Fold 3, Z Flip 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lGwK67"&gt;Verizon has said that all phones it releases as of now will support C-band 5G, and the carrier expects to offer over 20 compatible phones by the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J0MtGT"&gt;Where can I get Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eUWKR5"&gt;Verizon has said it will provide a C-band coverage map at launch, but so far, no such map is available on the carrier’s website — perhaps a consequence of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;eleventh-hour concessions to the FAA&lt;/a&gt;. You can expect just about every major metro market to have some degree of C-band coverage in January: the company has promised to reach “more than 100 million people in 1,700-plus cities around the nation” with the faster flavor of 5G this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv5XUO"&gt;But it’s a rolling process and won’t be instantly available everywhere. I’m located in downtown Brooklyn and am still riding on the slower 5G Nationwide network as of mid-day Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uMjii0"&gt;How do I know if I’m on Verizon’s C-band 5G?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3cv4p"&gt;Verizon’s C-band 5G shares the same “5G Ultra Wideband” indicator in your phone’s status bar as millimeter wave 5G. That makes things a little confusing, but if you’re suddenly (and consistently) seeing “5G UW” appear in places where you never had it previously, that’s the best evidence that your device is taking advantage of the faster 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cb94xu"&gt;How fast is it really?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj8mhW"&gt;Based on many early tests, pretty fast — and on a different level altogether than 5G Nationwide. Upload speeds aren’t anything spectacular, but many Verizon customers on C-band are getting download rates that range &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7pjbf/lake_county_il_north_of_chicago_is_live/"&gt;anywhere from 200&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7p997/indiana_cband_result/"&gt;500Mbps&lt;/a&gt; and, in the very best cases, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7qe1h/cband_live_in_downtown_la/"&gt;over 800Mbps&lt;/a&gt;. And these are in regions where cellular data had previously often topped out around 60 or 80Mbps, so the upgrade is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y1txFg"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-19T16:01:56.193427+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/s7os2i/cband_in_rochester_ny_is_live/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;C-Band in Rochester NY is live&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/"&gt;verizon&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UTc47i"&gt;Do I need to change my plan to get C-band 5G on Verizon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkNPVt"&gt;Not necessarily. The new, faster 5G is included on Verizon’s 5G Play More, 5G Do More, and 5G Get More Unlimited plans. Ahead of the C-band rollout, Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867007/verizon-t-mobile-att-unlimited-plan-5g"&gt;slightly rebranded and tweaked those plans&lt;/a&gt; — with the top plan now offering truly unlimited 5G data. But if you’re on a previous version of those plans, and since actual plan features have changed, in most cases, you’ll automatically be rolled over to the new plans within two billing cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQO4A5"&gt;The exception to this is Verizon’s entry-level Start Unlimited plan, which does not include 5G Ultra Wideband whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0ztXEU"&gt;What about the whole airplane safety thing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YhstDY"&gt;Don’t expect to get C-band speeds at your local airport for some time. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have begrudgingly agreed to delay activating C-band 5G around many airports and are creating exclusion zones to address airplane-related safety concerns that continue to be raised by the FAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G05uF5"&gt;Both carriers have strongly criticized the FAA for being unprepared for this moment. “The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our nation’s airlines have not been able to fully resolve navigating 5G around airports, despite it being safe and fully operational in more than 40 other countries,” Verizon said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fESPh"&gt;If you’re a Verizon customer and are already using the faster mid-band 5G, feel free to share some of your impressions in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T begins 5G C-band rollout in limited number of metro areas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G Wireless Service To Launch In U.S. Despite Aviation Industry Concerns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM_JlKgcNCV4bS6JDyGdiFhbYIs=/53x0:2369x1544/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408374/1365480215.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvG9W7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2022/connectivity.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is lighting up its expanded 5G service&lt;/a&gt; in just eight metro areas in the US on Wednesday, including Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Jacksonville, Orlando, and South Florida (&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/ecms//dam/snrdocs/pdf/metro-areas-with-c-band.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). This comes after both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;voluntarily limited the activation of C-band spectrum around airports&lt;/a&gt; after facing mounting pressure from airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRI818"&gt;“Today’s introduction begins in limited parts of 8 metro areas across the U.S. It will expand rapidly as our thoughtful and efficient deployment ramps up throughout the year,” Chris Sambar, AT&amp;amp;T’s executive vice president of technology operations, explains in the post announcing the expansion. “With 17 C-Band-capable devices already available online and in our stores, you can start seeing those speeds today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="89AWZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meanwhile, Verizon plans on activating towers in 1,700 cities this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ih1vQ0"&gt;Just one day before Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s scheduled 5G rollout on January 19th, major airlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889141/us-airlines-united-american-delta-5g-c-band-disruption-radar-altimeter"&gt;warned against activating 5G towers for fear of “catastrophic disruption”&lt;/a&gt; to flights operating across the country. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890080/5g-flight-cancel-att-verizon-c-band-emirates-air-india-ana-japan"&gt;Air India, Emirates, Japan Airlines, and ANA&lt;/a&gt; canceled some of their flights in advance over concerns that the 5G expansion could &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g"&gt;interfere with radar altimeters&lt;/a&gt; that aircraft use to make low-visibility landings. Ahead of the rollout, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reached an agreement with both carriers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/8/22873765/faa-verizon-att-airport-5g-carriers-buffer-zone"&gt;create 50 buffer zones where AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will shut off transmitters for six months near airports&lt;/a&gt; with high traffic volume and frequent low-visibility conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY1Hnk"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T expressed frustration at the FAA’s failure to “utilize the two years they’ve had to responsibly plan for this deployment,” as well as its “inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services.” AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon’s activation of the C-band spectrum has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867221/att-verizon-5g-midband-spectrum-faa-air-safety-delay-cband"&gt;faced pushback by the FAA&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in two delays. And while AT&amp;amp;T is taking a more cautious approach to its rollout, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/get-most-out-of-verizon-5g-ultra-wideband-network" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon plans on activating its network in 1,700 cities&lt;/a&gt; — covering 100 million more people — this month.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qPZ1h"&gt;AMD claimed back in 2020 that 4GB of VRAM was “insufficient” for modern PC games and could result in error messages, warning limits, lower framerates, and even gameplay stutter or pop-in issues. Today, AMD is launching the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865817/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-rdna-2-price-release-date"&gt;$199 RX 6500 XT&lt;/a&gt; with... 4GB of VRAM, and the blog post featuring AMD’s original claims has mysteriously disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tNhpf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/amd-hides-2020-blogpost-claiming-4gb-vram-is-not-enough-for-todays-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru &lt;/em&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; AMD has hidden the blog post today, as it was previously accessible yesterday, and a &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SFDks_9NnscJ:https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/game-beyond-4gb/ba-p/414776"&gt;Google cached view version&lt;/a&gt; from January 16th has the post in full. “AMD is leading the industry at providing gamers with high VRAM graphics solutions across the entire product offering,” said Adit Bhutani, a Radeon marketing specialist for AMD, in the blog post from 2020. “Competitive products at a similar entry level price-point are offering up to a maximum of 4GB of VRAM, which is evidently not enough for todays games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAjj6s"&gt;After this article was published, the blog post suddenly reappeared. AMD has not responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ZyT5"&gt;At the time, AMD was promoting its own GPUs for 1080p gaming that included 6GB or 8GB of VRAM. The company performed a series of tests showing how much better an 8GB model of its RX 5500 XT was compared to a measly 4GB model. It looks like this blog post magically disappeared just as AMD is about to launch a new 4GB GPU today. &lt;em&gt;Mysterious&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWbvQ9tNarmmy_ZEhVAVkx36HdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178953/amdoops.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s 2020 blog post included performance graphs highlighting 4GB GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="35S32j"&gt;The new entry-level RX 6500 XT is supposedly priced at $199 and is available to purchase today (if you’re lucky). AMD’s marketing for this new GPU included a media roundtable earlier this month, where &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563016/why-less-could-mean-more-in-amd-and-nvidias-new-budget-gpu-battle.html"&gt;Radeon vice president Laura Smith claimed&lt;/a&gt; “even with the four gigs of frame buffer, that’s a really nice frame buffer size for the majority of triple-A games.” &lt;em&gt;Awkward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3cKf9"&gt;Now, this could all be a totally innocent mistake or the most coincidental technical glitch we’ve ever seen, so we reached out to AMD to comment on the missing blog post. The company hasn’t responded, but it is back on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clct6d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 19th, 12:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the missing forum post has been conveniently restored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia added a buggy Android 11 update to its Shield TV lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uRP34JSek3DYCgw5nVJ-rtIHIJ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408367/DSCF4370.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sMubHJ"&gt;When Nvidia announced the rollout of the Shield Experience 9.0 (Android 11) update for its Android TV devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880057/nvidia-shield-android-11-update-set-top-box-streaming"&gt;we were impressed&lt;/a&gt; by the simple fact that it would include Shield TV models dating back to 2015 — but the buzz was short-lived as many owners are reporting major bugs on even the latest models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaY5me"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/17/shield-tv-android-11-plex-app-issues/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, people that ran the update on their Shield TVs lost access to their Plex media servers — a popular use case for the devices thanks to their powerful processor and a USB port that supports storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MemTJC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well upgraded my shield to 9.0 wish I hadn't now  not very happy!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/WejE0v1ebk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WejE0v1ebk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Justin Greatrix (@Hotwire147) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hotwire147/status/1482138909161267201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dubqrh"&gt;Nvidia is taking action on the matter: it posted a &lt;a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5303/kw/permission"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to give apps (like Plex) permission to use storage devices in Android 11, and at least one Reddit user wrote that it fixed their Plex server. The company also opened a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fshield-tv%2F9%2F481674%2Fandroid-11-application-issues%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22891143%2Fnvidia-shield-tv-android-11-update-bugs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;support forum&lt;/a&gt; to collect bug reports on its Android 11 products directly from users and developed a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fshield-tv%2F9%2F481782%2Fshield-experience-upgrade-90-known-issues%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22891143%2Fnvidia-shield-tv-android-11-update-bugs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of about 27 known and reported bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxyoUv"&gt;Another popular use case for the Shield TV is running Kodi for live TV and other media — but there are reports it also shows performance issues, stuttering, and outputting blank screens. Even popular streaming apps like YouTube and Hulu have exhibited everything from delayed loading to blank screens, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShieldAndroidTV/comments/s3jg2b/android_11_application_issues/"&gt;posts on the Shield subreddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LvCNbq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Great update guys &lt;a href="https://t.co/kMPcJQ2Wwf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kMPcJQ2Wwf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— IncredibleJohn (@IncredibleJohnY) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IncredibleJohnY/status/1481319924878434307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWMrDL"&gt;Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fshield-tv%2F9%2F481434%2Fshield-experience-upgrade-90-hotfix-image%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22891143%2Fnvidia-shield-tv-android-11-update-bugs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HotFix program is available&lt;/a&gt; for testing bug fixes as they come out, but bear in mind that these are untested releases that break some DRM-d services like Disney Plus and don’t include an option to roll back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says 400 million free N95 masks will be available at US pharmacies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="First Responders Prepare Coronavirus Safety Kits For Field Officers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VYPCvmg_w8LSAKK1w1UV4EFk4k=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408165/1206664154.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;N95 face masks offer better protection against COVID than cloth ones, the CDC says | Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9utJ5v"&gt;The US government will make 400 million N95 face masks available for free at pharmacies and health centers, sourcing them from the Strategic National Stockpile, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1483831305448173578?s=20"&gt;White House tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3z5O8"&gt;The announcement comes not long after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that the cloth masks worn by most people don’t provide as much prevention of coronavirus transmission as N95 masks or KN95 masks, the international equivalent. Some health experts have argued that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/24/health/cloth-mask-omicron-variant-wellness/index.html"&gt;cloth masks are particularly ineffective&lt;/a&gt; against the highly contagious omicron variant of COVID-19 that has pushed infection rates higher in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WV1jVQ"&gt;N95 masks are made with several layers of material that have better filtration than cloth masks and fit more snugly than other nonsurgical masks or face coverings, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6WDda"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our Administration is making 400 million N95 masks from the Strategic National Stockpile available for free to Americans.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;N95 masks will be available for the public to pick up at tens of thousands of local pharmacies and health centers.&lt;/p&gt;— The White House (@WhiteHouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1483831305448173578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIbq6N"&gt;The messaging from US health officials around N95 masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206728/cloth-face-masks-white-house-coronavirus-covid-cdc-messaging"&gt;has been confusing&lt;/a&gt;, to say the least. When the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206044/masks-cloth-coronavirus-cdc-recommendation-guidelines-wear-spread-prevent-covid-19"&gt;released guidelines in April 2020&lt;/a&gt; recommending people in the US wear “simple cloth coverings” on their faces to prevent transmission of the coronavirus, it was a reversal from its earlier stance that masks weren’t necessary at all, except for healthcare providers and people who were acutely ill. As part of that April 2020 guidance, the CDC stressed that the general public shouldn’t use surgical and N95 masks in order to reserve them for healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3ZuL6"&gt;The White House didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday, but the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/free-n95-masks-to-be-made-available-at-pharmacies-white-house-says-11642586403"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the free masks will be available at pharmacies and community health centers beginning next week, and the program should be in full swing by early February, with three masks available per person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPYpur"&gt;And the website that the Biden administration promised would be available for Americans to order free coronavirus tests to be delivered by mail is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;now up and running&lt;/a&gt;, although some users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890031/white-house-rapid-covid-tests-apartment-bug-usps"&gt;reported problems trying to order tests&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to apartment buildings or multiple-family residences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Forbidden West’s new story trailer brings back Aloy’s old friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APyLNayutg2BbS_2YTA6yeFwfaw=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408107/horizon_forbidden_west_screenshot_12_disclaimer_en_27may21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aOcH2I"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21285673/horizon-forbidden-west-2-ps5-trailer-teaser-zero-dawn-sequel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is almost here, and to celebrate, PlayStation released a new trailer. In the new story trailer, we get a better idea of the threats Aloy will face going into the west. The land is dying, affected by some kind of ruinous blight that only Aloy armed with her Focus has the power to stop. To do so, she’ll mount her trusty strider and head west, exploring the beautiful ruins of famous landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mi65FV"&gt;Aloy won’t be alone on her trip. Her old friends Erend and Varl will accompany her on her journey. Another old “friend,” Sylens, has also reappeared in the west and seems to be working for the Regalla, a tribe dedicated to war and conquest, giving them the means to command and control the machines.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY6o6y"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, Aloy will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;ride, hang glide, and scuba dive&lt;/a&gt; through gorgeous new locales, searching for the secrets of the new plague and the means to destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYLUTK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; launches on PlayStation on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The virus isn’t going to go away&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4xmWh3"&gt;The earliest reports of a novel virus causing an unusual pneumonia emerged in December 2019. In the weeks that followed, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077214/coronavirus-rapid-global-response-progress-sars-unknown-virus-china-public-health"&gt;global scientific community&lt;/a&gt; identified the virus — a coronavirus, like the viruses that caused SARS and MERS — and named the disease it causes: COVID-19. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21156325/coronavirus-pandemic-who-declares-covid-19-outbreak-global-h1n1"&gt;spread quickly&lt;/a&gt; around the world, upending the rhythms of day-to-day life, changing the patterns of human behavior, stressing health care systems, and killing millions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2pvYd"&gt;An unprecedented effort to quickly develop vaccines paid off in late 2020, when pharmaceutical companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; released data showing that their shots were highly effective. A vaccination campaign quickly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;helped protect people&lt;/a&gt; in higher-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, preventing hundreds of thousands of deaths. But vaccinations lagged in lower-income countries, and vaccine equity continues to be a major issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jt9PsB"&gt;New highly contagious and immune-evading variants, like delta and omicron, drove resurgences of the virus around the world through 2021 and 2022. Broad exposure to the virus and vaccine coverage helped limit the damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKDbpB"&gt;Experts say that the coronavirus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128218/coronavirus-epidemic-endemic-risk-fear-cure-treatment"&gt;isn’t going to go away&lt;/a&gt;. Population-level immunity and broader access to vaccines will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445906/social-end-pandemic-covid-adjustment-death-vibes"&gt;defang its threat&lt;/a&gt;, and COVID-19 won’t always be an active public health emergency. But it’s another addition to the list of respiratory viruses we contend with each year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbOfga"&gt;This weekend, I noticed that my PS5 and Switch were literally collecting dust — and realized that’s because I’ve been playing my games almost exclusively on Xbox Game Pass instead. The service has an incredible wealth of titles; in just the past couple weeks, I’ve finished &lt;em&gt;Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;, unpacked boxes in &lt;em&gt;Unpacking&lt;/em&gt;, tried and failed to get invested in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, watched my wife deliver mail in &lt;em&gt;Lake&lt;/em&gt;, and am currently living out my Jedi dreams in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;. I can check out new games almost as easy as hitting play on a Netflix show, too, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;the recently added ability&lt;/a&gt; to stream titles from the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GL9oyS"&gt;But now that Microsoft is paying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;$68.7 billion to acquire Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; — the company’s biggest buy in history — it’s going to be even harder for other gaming companies to pull me away from Game Pass as its power and influence grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gzNprt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft has been leading the charge on a Netflix-esque gaming service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mfX14c"&gt;Microsoft has been leading the charge on a Netflix-esque gaming service for years. The company first launched Xbox Game Pass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15684972/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscription-launch-date"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and it feels like it’s been on a shopping spree ever since. It acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;-maker Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18658920/microsoft-acquires-double-fine-psychonauts-e3-2019"&gt;Tim Schafer’s Double Fine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446914/microsoft-studios-the-initiative-undead-labs-playground-games-ninja-theory-compulsion-games-xbox-e3"&gt;the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; to bolster its roster of developers and, importantly, the number of games it can exclusively offer on Game Pass. With its priciest $15-a-month plan, Microsoft lets you play many Game Pass games on many non-Xbox devices via the cloud, too — a useful option at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;new Xbox consoles are hard to come by&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed4V3n"&gt;With Activision, Microsoft would get a huge stable of hit games that could make the already-great Game Pass nearly unbeatable, particularly if Microsoft were to withhold them from other platforms like Sony’s PlayStation. Perhaps the most obvious potential addition is the hugely popular &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series — Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/18/bobby-kotick-interview-why-activision-blizzard-did-the-deal-with-microsoft/"&gt;already indicated&lt;/a&gt; that a streaming &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; could be in the cards. But it doesn’t stop there: Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; could become an Xbox console exclusive on Game Pass. Microsoft could decide to bring back &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt;. And, of course, Blizzard can easily bring early hit PC games like &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; to the PC side of Game Pass, too. These are only a few of the possibilities on the table, and I’m sure Microsoft is thinking about many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2NAZ9V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A guide to Microsoft’s Xbox game studios empire","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890225/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-aqcuisition-game-studios"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZUVH9G"&gt;Game Pass is such a big part of Microsoft’s gaming strategy that my colleague Tom Warren argued in July 2020 that Game Pass is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;company’s true next-gen Xbox&lt;/a&gt;. And that was &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; Microsoft’s big deals for Bethesda and Activision. The company’s huge investments and focus have put Microsoft leagues ahead of any competition, and it’s looking increasingly tough for anyone to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3SurN"&gt;Sony’s subscription efforts for PlayStation, for example, don’t offer day-and-date access to the company’s biggest exclusive games, which is arguably Microsoft’s biggest advantage with Game Pass. Even though Sony is reportedly planning to merge its PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now services into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816087/sony-playstation-5-game-subscription-service-xbox-games-pass-now-spartacus"&gt;Game Pass competitor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Jason Schreier, who scooped the existence of Sony’s plans, says you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466821381568536578"&gt;still shouldn’t expect it&lt;/a&gt; to have Sony’s biggest games the day they’re out. That means you might have to pay full price to play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665085/sony-god-of-war-ragnarok-playstation-ps5-showcase"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it releases, while Game Pass subscribers won’t have to drop a dime extra to play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iCwFlj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This new service, expected in the spring, will likely retain the "PlayStation Plus" branding. Don't expect Sony to include its big new games day one like Game Pass does, but the expectation is a stronger offering than PlayStation Now&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466821381568536578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WsYUdr"&gt;Sony also has ground to make up in cloud gaming. The company had a major head start, buying cloud gaming startup Gaikai in 2012 and launching cloud gaming with PlayStation Now in 2015, but Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;largely squandered its lead&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, PlayStation Now lets you stream back-catalog PS4, PS3, and PS2 games, but with Game Pass, you can stream new Microsoft games like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;. And in a weird twist of corporate cooperation, Sony is relying &lt;em&gt;on Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; for the future of its cloud gaming after the two tech giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632374/microsoft-sony-cloud-gaming-partnership-amazon-google"&gt;announced a partnership in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TA9ANm"&gt;Nintendo is even further behind. Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) does let you play some of the company’s very best older games, but only on a Nintendo Switch system — unlike Game Pass, you can’t play those games on your PC or your phone. To relive the glory days of Nintendo 64 games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;you have to pay $30 extra annually for the premium tier&lt;/a&gt;. NSO doesn’t offer cloud gaming at all, though Nintendo does sell cloud versions of some third-party games, such as the three &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710665/kingdom-hearts-remix-hd-nintendo-switch-cloud-versions"&gt;mainline &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; titles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538173/control-cloud-version-nintendo-switch-release-remedy-entertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And while possible, it seems extremely unlikely that Nintendo will offer day-and-date releases for its upcoming titles in the near future on NSO; you will almost certainly have to buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on its own when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc5wJV"&gt;Other gaming subscription services also don’t pose much competition to Microsoft. One of the best is perhaps EA Play, but that’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428764/xbox-game-pass-ea-play-subscription"&gt;included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription&lt;/a&gt;. Ubisoft has its own take, Ubisoft Plus, and while it isn’t bundled with Game Pass, Ubisoft is planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868704/ubisoft-plus-xbox-launch-rainbow-six-extraction-xbox-game-pass"&gt;bring the service to Xbox in the future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324285/google-play-pass-new-countries-annual-subscription"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; also offer gaming subscriptions, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"&gt;even Netflix is getting into games&lt;/a&gt;, but all have a limited selection right now, and all are focused on gaming on phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="642iOW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft arguably leads in cloud gaming, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlneIG"&gt;At one point, cloud gaming seemed like a way other companies might offer potentially great Netflix-like subscriptions, but that just hasn’t come to pass. Google had promising plans with Stadia, but it decided that investing in original content wasn’t worth it and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its in-house game development studios&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon’s Luna — which is still in early access more than a year after its initial launch — relies on other publishers for content, and the only publisher contributing major games is Ubisoft (which runs its own Ubisoft Plus channel that costs a separate subscription fee). Nvidia’s GeForce Now is technically impressive, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;especially its new RTX 3080 tier&lt;/a&gt;, but the company has struggled with publishers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing"&gt;over rights to content&lt;/a&gt;. Cloud gaming services from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418882/walmart-cloud-gaming-service-epic-games-trial-emails"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857805/ea-cloud-gaming-service-surprise-closed-beta-project-atlas"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/14/8958289/comcast-ea-xfinity-games"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; have fallen by the wayside. Microsoft, on the other hand, has found success offering cloud gaming as a perk instead of relying on the technology as the core of its subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WBScHb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"To succeed, cloud gaming needs to disappear","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jCZBq0"&gt;Microsoft’s huge investment in Game Pass and studios like Activision could help it upend the traditional console business that’s been largely dominated by Sony and Nintendo. All three companies have fought for players’ attention for years with exclusive games from first-party studios that are available only on their respective consoles. You have to buy the right hardware to be able to experience the exciting new games everyone is talking about. But with Game Pass, you could play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, one of Microsoft’s biggest games of 2021, on day one with just your laptop, an Xbox controller, and a good internet connection — no expensive console required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSFLwB"&gt;That scenario is in line with things Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said before. “I don’t need to sell any specific version of the console in order for us to reach our business goals,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661247/phil-spencer-interview-xbox-project-scarlett-xcloud-e3-2019"&gt;he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when the Xbox Series X was codenamed Project Scarlett and Xbox’s cloud gaming wasn’t out yet. “In the end, how many subscribers you have to something like Game Pass, how many games people are buying, those are much better metrics on the health of the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36ZCGT"&gt;Right now, Microsoft is competing for more exclusive games for Xbox at an unheard-of scale — the nearly $69 billion Activision deal is set to be more than double Microsoft’s previous largest — and making those games easier to play than ever by adding them to that widely-accessible Game Pass subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NJYgX"&gt;Microsoft is making the gamble that Game Pass is the future of the gaming industry. Even if it’s wrong, the company will have an impressive roster of new Xbox games. But if it’s right, the Activision deal could give it a huge lead. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series finally has a name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzJITKQOFa3-DRvYtXlVN7Rd-oE=/93x0:1271x785/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70407991/lotr_rings_of_power.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mCIC5M"&gt;Amazon’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606267/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series finally has a name, and it’s a damned good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYrOwK"&gt;Set during Second Age, thousands of years before the events of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power &lt;/em&gt;will tell the story of how the titular rings of power were first forged and divvied up amongst Middle-earth’s races. The new series’ title — along with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhqGCPMfkNM"&gt;forging-focused teaser video&lt;/a&gt; — allude to how the rings’ creation were both tied to the reemergence of a long-dormant evil in the world and to the subsequent hardships that the world’s men, elves, and dwarves would end up facing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y89D07"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://press.amazonstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-videos-most-anticipated-new-series-of-2022-r"&gt;a press statement&lt;/a&gt; about the series and its title, co-showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay said that their desire was to come up with a title that “could live on in the spine of a book next to J.R.R. Tolkien’s other classics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkJJbL"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The Rings of Power&lt;/em&gt; unites all the major stories of Middle-earth’s Second Age: the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the epic tale of Númenor, and the Last Alliances of Elves and Men,” the pair explained. “Until now, audiences have only seen on-screen the story of the One Ring — but before there was one, there were many... and we’re excited to share the epic story of them all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcXdmo"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;The Rings of Power &lt;/em&gt;certainly has all the makings of being the sort of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;big-budget prestige fantasy&lt;/a&gt; that fans of the genre might want to tune into weekly, this series in particular is likely going to live and die by its ability to actually expand upon &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;lore in ways that feel essential and complementary to the canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWyail"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power &lt;/em&gt;season one hits Prime Video on September 2nd, with new episodes dropping every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
