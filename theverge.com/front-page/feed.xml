    <title>How to file and pay your 2020 taxes online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="irs (ray tsang flickr)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP0xxiL-v-HhVA274y3XwS_qa2o=/0x3:1100x736/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687934/irs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSUmXj"&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took everyone, including the IRS, by surprise. Because of the issues people were dealing with last spring, the filing deadline for federal tax payments was moved from the usual mid-April date to July 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH5z8m"&gt;This year, despite the still-very-present pandemic and various upheavals in our nation’s capital, it doesn’t look like we’re going to get the same tax vacation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1IHJ6"&gt;As a result, and considering the pandemic might still slow down the processing of refunds and other issues, it might not be a bad idea to start working on those taxes as soon as possible. And whether you’re a full-time worker dealing with a single 1040 or a freelancer / gig worker getting a series of 1099s, the fastest way to pay the piper these days is to do it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="7RmRXX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10286635"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DtewJZ"&gt;The IRS offers a series of directions &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; to help US citizens figure out their taxes, report those taxes, and send in payments (or ask for refunds) using its e-file online method. Here’s a rundown of what’s available and where you can find it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your first stop: IRS.gov" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZP6jZ2r6bfb_vXfNAlliRrrC5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238649/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.52.29_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your first stop: IRS.gov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MrTZxI"&gt;How do I file online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wfouu8"&gt;There are several ways to file online, depending on your income and your comfort level in dealing with the whole income tax process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAGjYo"&gt;If your &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income"&gt;adjusted gross income&lt;/a&gt; was $72,000 or under, you can use the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free"&gt;IRS Free File option&lt;/a&gt;. The site offers a number of third-party services that can help you put together and file your taxes free of charge. Of course, that is assuming the third party doesn’t try to scam you into paying more than you have to; back in April of 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; revealed&lt;/a&gt; that TurboTax and other suppliers were deliberately hiding the pages for their free services in order to convince taxpayers to purchase additional features. As a result, in early 2020, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/1/21045779/irs-turbotax-free-file-h-r-block-tax-preparation-new-rules"&gt;IRS published rules&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting these practices. Still, it pays to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Free File is available for those whose income is $72,000 or under" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xv0usaE6z1RIzq_Gln4pzREg58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238669/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.58.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free File is available for those whose income is $72,000 or under.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fC7FEJ"&gt;If your income is above $72,000, you can still use fillable forms provided by IRS Free File, but you don’t get the support of the free software, and you can’t do your state taxes through this method. The forms will be available starting on January 25th. (If you’re really into doing your own taxes, you may want to check out the &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-tax-tips"&gt;IRS page on tax tips&lt;/a&gt;, which includes how to handle things like a &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit"&gt;recovery rebate credit&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlnklN"&gt;If you’re not a pro at filling out taxes, you’re going to either have to use e-file with one of the available software solutions or find a tax preparer who can do it for you. In the case of the latter, the person or company who does your taxes needs to be authorized to use e-file; if you don’t already have a tax professional, you can find one at &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/authorized-irs-e-file-provider-locator-service-for-tax-professionals"&gt;the IRS site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5JFGLd"&gt;How do I pay online?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qQd1r5"&gt;The IRS lists a variety of ways you can &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments"&gt;pay your taxes online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmMzlE"&gt;If you use tax preparation software or have your taxes prepared by a tax professional, you can have the IRS pull the funds directly from your bank account via Electronic Funds Withdrawal at the same time you file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwT6HE"&gt;You can also use IRS Direct Pay to pull funds from a savings or checking account. Finally, you can use a credit or debit card; however, there is usually a fee involved (since the IRS isn’t going to absorb what your credit card company is charging for the service).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ugxyPN"&gt;How do I get my refund?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8jn9l"&gt;One of the ways the IRS tries to convince you to file online is to assure you that you will get your refund faster — &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds/tax-season-refund-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;in less than 21 days&lt;/a&gt;, in most cases. Once you’ve filed, you can &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds"&gt;check the status&lt;/a&gt; of your refund online. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs2goapp"&gt;download the official IRS2GoApp&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to check the status of your refund, pay your taxes, and get other information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfTl5K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9GmZM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new education Chromebooks include durable designs and Arm-based processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sbRkMxlyLUJhLhBrjVP477qEhQ=/0x0:1221x814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687527/Acer_Chromebook_Spin_512__R853TA__dual_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebook Spin 512 comes with a 3:2 aspect ratio display.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAy8iY"&gt;Acer is announcing five new laptops aimed at schools today, consisting of four Chromebooks and one Windows convertible. Two of the Chromebooks are Intel-based convertibles, with screens that spin around to turn them into laptops, while the other two feature a more traditional design and are powered by Arm-based processors. All five laptops are designed to be durable, with spill-resistant keyboards and components tested to MIL-STD 810H military durability standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASn0gC"&gt;The two convertible Chromebooks are the Acer Spin 512 and Spin 511. They’re powered by Intel processors (specifically the N4500 and N5100). The Spin 511 has a 11.6-inch HD 16:9 display, while the Spin 512 has a 12-inch HD+ 3:2 display. Both come with up to 64GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM, while battery life is rated up to 10 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5DXHcQlE_vKBKCVtteCce481SI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244568/Chromebook_Spin_511_R753T_angle3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spin 511 starts at $399.99 and will be available in North America from April.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch8LzC"&gt;Both the Spin 512 and Spin 511 have antimicrobial scratch-resistant displays, but the Spin 512 also features a similar antimicrobial coating on its keyboard and touchpad. The Chromebooks will be available in Europe in March and North America in April. The Spin 512 starts at $429.99 (€399), while the Spin 511 is slightly cheaper at $399.99 (€369).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XwXzNj_9dtAQloAIKAr96RAS1Ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22243058/Acer_Chromebook_311_left_facing2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebook 311 is equipped with a Mediatek MT8183 processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUdS5NdQOYRhU1WHu5-5XNhkX1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244569/Acer_Chromebook_511__C741L__photo_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the Chromebook 511 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VfIl0O"&gt;Next up are the 11-inch Arm-based Chromebook 511 and Chromebook 311, which also have durable designs. The 511 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor, features 4G LTE connectivity and can go for up to 20 hours on a charge. Meanwhile, the 311 has a Mediatek MT8183 processor and also runs for up to 20 hours on a charge. The 311 launches this month in North America and is priced starting at $299.99, while the 511 is coming in April starting at $399.99. They’ll launch in Europe in March for €269 and €399 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c-Mwif2I2SBwWjjXzDc26-ozGwc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244572/Acer_TravelMate_Spin_B3_product_photo_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TravelMate Spin B3 is an Intel-based convertible that runs Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H34PSt"&gt;Finally, there’s a $329.99 (€409) Windows laptop, the TravelMate Spin B3. It also includes a durable keyboard that can flip around to turn the laptop into a tablet, and is powered by up to an Intel Pentium Silver processor with as much as 12 hours of battery life. The Spin B3 comes with an antimicrobial display as standard, and the option of having a similar coating on its keyboard and touchpad. The laptop will launch in North America in April, and Europe at some point in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siPFI9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLebeV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WRsdr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeBnAr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VLC now runs natively on M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tOM-1oSaKwdUETmqV44mtyEpVhg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68687438/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T4tw8R"&gt;The latest update to ubiquitous open-source media player VLC is here, and it comes with native support for Apple silicon Mac computers — the new versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; with Apple’s own M1 processor. VLC 3.0.12 also includes some visual tweaks to bring it further in line with Big Sur, the latest version of macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55OgZB"&gt;Mac apps don’t strictly require native updates to work with the M1 processor, since Apple silicon Macs include Rosetta 2, a translation layer that lets software compiled for x86 processors run surprisingly well on the newer Arm-based hardware. But for an app like VLC, which many users rely on for playback of hefty 4K or 8K video files, the improvements to performance and efficiency could be notable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8kKeXD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;VLC 3.0.12 is now out!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Support for Apple Silicon (Mac M1) and Big Sur, improvements for DASH, RIST, Bluray support, fixes for macOS audio, Windows GPU, crashes and security issues.&lt;a href="https://t.co/3zAr8VgzbL"&gt;https://t.co/3zAr8VgzbL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TAU8ayKEBU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TAU8ayKEBU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— VideoLAN (@videolan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/videolan/status/1351222869167058955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob1oPE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/18/vlc-media-player-for-macos-updated-with-full-support-for-m1-macs/"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new VLC isn’t a universal binary, which is to say that the Arm-optimized code isn’t yet included by default. The regular VLC app has to be updated to 3.0.12, then again to 3.0.12.1 on an Apple silicon Mac in order to get the optimized version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9wqec"&gt;Version 3.0.12 also has some minor features and tweaks for VLC on other platforms, including better Blu-ray tracks support and fixing some crashes when using Direct3D 11 on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 discs are $30 today for PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_baR2XzSQjI9oAbCSFUK9lmRFc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68686246/Cyberpunk2077_Always_bring_a_gun_to_a_knife_fight_RGB_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZNvnr"&gt;If you’ve already nabbed a next-gen PlayStation or Xbox — or are willing to give developer CD Projekt the benefit of the doubt that it’ll eventually work on your current-gen machine — you can now pick up the standard disc edition of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; for half-price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cyberpunk-2077-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DJWBYKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Cyberpunk+2077&amp;amp;qid=1611010006&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=cee8116616eb390338d109e9e6c9fef0&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729808874044070632" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s $30, instead of $60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zRQAB"&gt;To be clear, that’s the price for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, which work on PS5 and Xbox Series X &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;far, far better than they do on current-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt;. (There’s no PS5 or Xbox Series X-specific version of the game so far, but the disc will include a free upgrade.) Amazon also has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cyberpunk-2077-PlayStation-4/dp/B07T8BP118/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Cyberpunk%2B2077&amp;amp;qid=1611010006&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5c81fc19a045562bdeedbd239bc724be&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the PC version for $40&lt;/a&gt;; compare to its normal price of $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lm6soO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NmU1ar"&gt;Sony actually took the unprecedented step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;removing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt;, and it still isn’t back, so we wouldn’t blame you if you want to hold off. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229627/cyberpunk-2077-first-update-launch-cd-projekt-red-playstation-store"&gt;Five days ago&lt;/a&gt;, CD Projekt Red promised the first major update for the game would arrive “within ten days,” but suggested it may still be weeks before additional fixes roll out. Even the PC version of the game is still riddled with bugs and half-baked systems, for that matter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;although some of them are quite hilarious&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiVSPE"&gt;A free next-gen console update that’ll turn your disc into a true PS5 and/or Xbox Series X copy of the game will arrive later in 2021, according to CD Projekt Red’s latest roadmap.

    <title>The developers of an acclaimed Skyrim mod just made it to the big leagues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLngQzbcZT5M8QuvgLwksqOAD1E=/130x0:1527x931/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68686121/20160628170805_629a1da4_xx.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iXMJ5l"&gt;In 2016, a team of modders released a game they developed in their spare time to nigh-universal acclaim — a mod for &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; that they called Enderal, with its own 30+ hour quest with gobs of original dialogue and professional voice acting. “[It’s the most fun I’ve had in an Elder Scrolls game in years,” &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/1/18246361/skyrim-mod-enderal-forgotten-stories"&gt;wrote our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the top-rated Skyrim mod of all time at &lt;em&gt;ModDB&lt;/em&gt;, has nearly 500,000 downloads at NexusMods and its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/"&gt;own Steam page&lt;/a&gt; filled with glowing reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMiLNo"&gt;Now, its developers are setting off to build a game of their own. On Sunday, &lt;a href="https://sureai.net/?fbclid=IwAR38aiIAs1Rbb2WGPxC8QSeHjnQLKbAGTZ6qYnTGcW4rwb2lZsyljJrHHg8"&gt;the team at SureAI released its final patch for Enderal&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that they no longer had as much free time to keep up development — because they’re working on “a new, commercial project which will hopefully be announced this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDZQZQ"&gt;They didn’t leave so much as a hint about what kind of game it might be — we checked the team’s social media accounts, Discord, and more — but it’d be surprising if it weren’t based in swords and sorcery seeing how they’ve been modding since &lt;em&gt;Morrowind&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/deFsUcnmZHYEpl6EBqEws3IpxQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22243761/20160628195315_1361550d_xx.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2je2vH"&gt;Whether you’re a fan or not (I’ll admit I’ve never played), it’s always refreshing to see talented game developers hit the big time. As you’re probably aware, some of the world’s most popular games started as mods: &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike, DOTA &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;and&lt;em&gt; PUBG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;began as overhauls for &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;WarCraft III &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Arma 2&lt;/em&gt; respectively, as did the likes of &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther, DayZ &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Stanley Parable&lt;/em&gt;. Developers of popular mods &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/289944/One_modders_journey_from_tinkerer_to_pro_game_developer.php"&gt;like the Darthmod for &lt;em&gt;Total War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have also made it into the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLHclS"&gt;These moves don’t always work out as everyone might hope, though: the developers of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 1942 &lt;/em&gt;bought the team behind the Desert Combat mod (my personal favorite) &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/digital-illusions-sign-popular-battlefield-1942-mod-makers"&gt;back in 2004&lt;/a&gt; to help work on the thematically similar &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dice-nyc-kia/1100-6127099/"&gt;only to shut them down right before the game shipped&lt;/a&gt; and refuse to pay $200,000 it owed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram says it ‘shut down hundreds of public calls for violence’ in US last week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8iB5K0WVV2i0suEbv7j-ykJ2tZ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68685906/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FiuRUa"&gt;Amid rising political tensions in the United States, Telegram founder Pavel Durov says his chat service has taken down hundreds of public calls for violence, in accordance with the platform’s terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CYJIi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/149"&gt;In a public Telegram post on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Durov emphasized the service’s commitment to banning speech that actively incites violence. “Telegram welcomes peaceful debate and protest, but our Terms of Service explicitly prohibit distributing public calls to violence,” he wrote. “Сivil movements all over the world rely on Telegram in order to stand up for human rights without resorting to inflicting harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YD9aH4"&gt;Notably, the post does not address Telegram’s encrypted chat feature, which protects conversations from outside access and thus is not subject to centralized moderation. Telegram has moderated against violence and terrorism in public rooms, but resisted mounting pressures to make those conversations more accessible to law enforcement. The rise of pro-Trump extremist violence in the United States has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/extremists-move-secret-line-channels-plan-inauguration-day-d-c-n1253876"&gt;rekindled the country’s debate about the value of encryption&lt;/a&gt;, and reinvigorated calls to weaken privacy protections for encrypted chat services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzTqOr"&gt;Durov said that Telegram had seen the same spike in violent threats that other US services have reported during the past month. “In early January, the Telegram moderation team started to receive an increased number of reports about US-related public activity on our platform,” the post reads. “The team acted decisively by clamping down on US channels that advocated violence. Thanks to these efforts, last week our moderators blocked and shut down hundreds of public calls for violence that could’ve otherwise reached tens of thousands of subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUouTO"&gt;Telegram has seen a significant boost in users over the same period, in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;a disastrous change to WhatsApp’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; that led many to flee the service. Signal also gained millions of users during the exodus, putting so much strain on the service’s infrastructure that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22235707/signal-back-app-privacy-encrypted-outage"&gt;became inaccessible for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgKWD9"&gt;The sudden risk of political violence in the US has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;put unprecedented pressure&lt;/a&gt; on services that fail to moderate violent threats — most notably Parler, which became inaccessible after abruptly losing its hosting service last week. Amazon Web Services, Parler’s hosting provider at the time, had reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;more than a hundred violent threats on the network&lt;/a&gt; over the course of weeks, all of which Parler said did not violate its terms of service. In the wake of the Capitol Raid, AWS cut ties with the company, which combined with similar actions from Apple and Google to render the social network entirely inoperable. Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;posted a brief message to users&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, but has yet to fully restore service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re getting closer to a Nintendo Switch-sized gaming PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VFwJMMNhXkEdzKDkvp1r0UfYJA=/49x0:978x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68685793/aya_neo_death_stranding.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3WMuTR"&gt;One year ago at CES 2020 in Las Vegas, Alienware made waves with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;a modular gaming PC that worked like a Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, with a pair of gamepads flanking a powerful Windows 10 tablet. Sadly, Alienware’s UFO was just a concept, as was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/7/22218956/lenovo-nec-switch-pc-lavie-mini-ces-concept"&gt;Lenovo’s take on the idea&lt;/a&gt; this year — but two companies are now taking up the torch with a pair of crowdfunded gadgets you might actually see in your lifetime. They look seriously legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLmyqf"&gt;The 5.5-inch &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fgpd-win3-the-world-s-1st-handheld-aaa-game-console%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F18%2F22237379%2Faya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GPD Win 3&lt;/a&gt; and the 7-inch &lt;a href="https://www.ayadevice.com/space"&gt;Aya Neo&lt;/a&gt; aren’t going about it in quite the same way; while the Ava tries to closely match Nintendo’s console in shape, size, and with strictly gaming controls on board, the GPD sticks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/15/16892268/gpd-win-2-announcement-specs-price-release-date"&gt;its palmtop computer roots&lt;/a&gt; with a slide-up screen that reveals a tiny backlit keyboard. There’s also a fingerprint sensor, a microSD slot and an optional Thunderbolt 4 dock if you want to use the GPD like a full Windows 10 computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oHuhU1-jn0EaANMb3X3xC2Xe09k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22243625/gpd_win_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images by GPD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The GPD Win 3.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mvcnSJ"&gt;What’s the same: both are genuinely trying to deliver a powerful tablet surrounded by joysticks and buttons for under $1,000 each. With Intel’s latest Tiger Lake chips and AMD’s Ryzen 4500U respectively, each has some of the latest and greatest integrated graphics you can buy, and they claim pretty decent performance as a result — &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; can reportedly hit 30fps at the Aya Neo’s 1280x800 resolution at low settings, and GPD &lt;a href="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607940096/yunaqdrzpepmpashnqzm.png"&gt;offers a long list&lt;/a&gt; of examples of recent, demanding games that you can coax well over the 50fps mark with its Intel Xe graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmWtKA"&gt;As you can see in the spec comparo sheet I whipped up below, each features 16GB of DDR4 memory, a speedy NVMe solid state drive, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0, a pair of stereo speakers, a genuine headphone jack, and multiple USB ports. Not bad! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nEsiF0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10290467"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="boFsQu"&gt;Just know that these systems are going to be &lt;em&gt;chonky&lt;/em&gt; compared to an actual Nintendo Switch’s 0.55-inch thick frame and 0.88-pound weight, and battery life will be a big question, with both the Aya Neo and GPD Win 3 allowing you to fine-tune the chip’s TDP wattage to get the most out of their tablet-sized cells. &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/GPD-Win-3-Review-The-Unofficial-Microsoft-Switch.514859.0.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NotebookCheck&lt;/em&gt; says you shouldn’t expect&lt;/a&gt; to get more than 1.5 hours out of the GPD Win 3 while playing a demanding game, though &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3JBmIiuJwU"&gt;Taki Udon on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; claims you can get 2-3 hours out of an early Aya Neo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="u7xMie"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EGiAm"&gt;Speaking of Taki Udon’s video, it looks like a fantastic overview of the handheld, so I recommend checking it out, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX52EnF77EU"&gt;this second vid&lt;/a&gt; that shows off how well games like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sekiro &lt;/em&gt;play on his Founder’s model. It’s not enough to convince me to crowdfund a company I’ve never heard of, but it’s a good start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNW28S"&gt;You should also know that not all of these handhelds are going to look and play the same: the transparent Aya you’re seeing in the videos was a limited edition of 15,000 for early pre-orders in China, with final models launching &lt;a href="https://www.ayadevice.com/post/more-informations-about-igg-campaign"&gt;in black and white&lt;/a&gt; instead when they ship in April. Aya will be launching its Indiegogo campaign in February with a “super early bird limited price” of $699, with no word on how much the rest of us might pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk8nxo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fgpd-win3-the-world-s-1st-handheld-aaa-game-console%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F18%2F22237379%2Faya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The GPD Win 3 is already on Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll pay $799 for the Core i5-1135G7 version, with the more powerful i7 chip starting at $899, or $949 for a package with the optional USB, HDMI and Gigabit Ethernet docking station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVX60Z"&gt;Between these handheld gaming PCs, the cute upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542841/playdate-games-handheld-panic-delay-2021"&gt;Playdate&lt;/a&gt; and the gorgeous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;squeaky clean mods&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205558/new-record-smallest-nintendo-64-mod-gmanmodz-cartridge-sized"&gt;of late&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550621/nintendo-earnings-q2-2020-switch-sales"&gt;popularity of the Switch itself&lt;/a&gt; and the march of ever smaller and more powerful chips, it feels like we might be entering a gaming handheld renaissance. Here’s hoping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHJTM7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZGaKE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s okay to let kids play Fortnite during a global pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9fJ9RxWDKz5BMr2RtP7FswnB1E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68685686/Fortnite_20190504150224.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Db77f3"&gt;On Sunday, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/health/covid-kids-tech-use.html"&gt;an article about the risks of sky-rocketing teenage device usage&lt;/a&gt; during quarantine — and as you might expect, they went straight for the guilty-parent touchstones. There are maudlin photos of a family ruined by gaming, and the quote “I’ve failed you as a father” comes in the second sentence. There are also curious comparisons to drug addiction (“There will be a period of epic withdrawal” after quarantine, one addiction expert warns) and vague claims about the impressionable nature of young brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZPaL"&gt;Before you rush to cut off junior’s Playstation Plus subscription, it’s worth putting things in perspective. We’re in the middle of a worldwide crisis, and the last ten months have been hard on everyone. We’ve seen historic jumps in depression and substance abuse even among adults, and healthy escapes are increasingly hard to come by. Digital entertainment has gotten &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150661/entertainment-2020-music-games-movies-comfort-favorites"&gt;a lot of us&lt;/a&gt; through the past year in one piece. For many kids, it’s one of the few places to carry on a semi-normal social life, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201807/children-adolescents-screentime-coronavirus-how-to-psychiatrist"&gt;many experts have emphasized&lt;/a&gt; a balanced approach rather than an outright cutoff. Digital interaction is an incredibly valuable thing, and dismissing it because of abstract screen panic is irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4unZna"&gt;The article briefly touches on online socializing, but saves it for a kind of ironic afterthought at the end. After cutting her son off from Xbox games for a few weeks, a parent notes, “it makes me feel badly when I try to restrict him. It’s his only socialization.” For a lot of kids, this is the whole point: online spaces like Fortnite are the only way to hang out with their friends. There is actual socializing happening here, and as long as in-person contact is a public health hazard, these are the only places it can happen. It’s important for kids to hang out with other kids, so cutting off screen time is actively isolating, damaging in ways that are far more concrete than screen time. The only reason to dismiss it is the lingering idea that online socializing somehow doesn’t count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8MA3C"&gt;What we’re seeing has less to do with screen time and more to do with the age-old problems of teen social lives. There are lots of healthy and social things you can do online, just like there are unhealthy and isolating things you can do offline. Whether it happens on a screen just isn’t the primary issue. It’s fine to worry about unhealthy spaces online, whether it’s eating-disorder culture on Instagram or incel sewers on Reddit — but the problem with those spaces is that they’re unhealthy, not that they’re online. Casting the internet as the problem just confuses things, and encourages parents to cut off one of their kids’ few healthy social outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ae8HE8"&gt;On some level, I understand the anxiety here. Parents are allowed to be depressed and anxious too! There is a ton to be stressed about in the world right now, and watching your kid play Xbox through it all might make you feel like you’re watching &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sJO0n6kvPRU?t=121"&gt;Ed Westwick play holocube in &lt;em&gt;Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure it’s alienating to watch your son play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; all day, but if you’re that worried about losing touch, it might be time to pick up a controller and spend some time in their world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="25Xbhm"&gt;A capitol rioter may have stolen Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s laptop with plans to sell it to the Russian government, &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20458358-riley-williams-affidavit"&gt;according to an FBI affidavit&lt;/a&gt; filed on Sunday. The affidavit charges Riley June Williams with unlawful entry and impeding government functions, based on extensive video record placing her at the scene of the Capitol riot. But the affidavit also uncovers an apparent plan to steal Speaker Pelosi’s laptop and convey it to a contact in Russia, who would then make contact with the country’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h5XWQ"&gt;Williams was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfzJs4MfTe0"&gt;identified by UK media&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend, and officers confirmed the identification with her driver’s license photo (on file with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) and in an in-person interview with her parents. Notably, public videos show Williams directing rioters to the general location of Pelosi’s office, consistent with the idea that she intended to ransack the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qe7igk"&gt;According to the affidavit, a former associate of Williams told police she had planned to steal Speaker Pelosi’s laptop with the intention of selling it to the Russian government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0K8LF"&gt;“[The witness] stated that Williams intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service,” the affidavit reads. “According to [the witness], the transfer of the computer device to Russia fell through for unknown reasons and Williams still has the computer device or destroyed it. This matter remains under investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyuU9D"&gt;Reuters has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-cyber/laptop-stolen-from-pelosis-office-during-storming-of-u-s-capitol-says-aide-idUSKBN29D2HA"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that a laptop was stolen from Pelosi’s office. According to an aide, the laptop was stationed in a conference room and “was used for presentations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMorAn"&gt;Device theft has been a significant concern for government IT workers in the wake of the capitol riot, which broke long-standing security procedures around congressional offices. The idea of devices being stolen or tampered with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/07/cybersecurity-202-riot-capitol-is-nightmare-scenario-cybersecurity-professionals/"&gt;was viewed&lt;/a&gt; as a “nightmare scenario” in the wake of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4R964I"&gt; “I don’t think I’d sleep well until the networks were rebuilt from scratch,” said one former House IT official on Twitter, “and every computer wiped and the internals visually inspected before being put back into service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxq79B"&gt;Williams remains at large, despite the ongoing investigation and public identification. She has discontinued her phone number and deleted social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram and Parler. After returning from the raid, she packed a bag and told her mother she would be gone “for a couple weeks,” the affidavit reads. “Williams did not provide her mother any information about her intended destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020 Game is a surprisingly fun side scroller about an awful year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7hXaaeXQSX2OPeuIrOWTzNHEZc=/0x0:1090x727/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68683707/msedge_nFgGLE9da9.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020 Game draws inspiration from the biggest trends of last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: 2020 Game&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W7xw3a"&gt;I get it, there’s absolutely no part of you that wants to relive the terrible year we just lived through. But I implore you to make an exception for &lt;a href="https://2020game.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020 Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a free web-based side scroller that offers a lighthearted take on last year’s events. It’s well-designed, creative, and — dare I say it — even laugh-out-loud funny in places, and well worth the 10 minutes or so it takes to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7IxUv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020 Game&lt;/em&gt; is the work of Max Garkavyy, who developed it alone over the course of six months. Each level takes the form of a major event or trend from last year, ranging from the early rush on toilet paper to the US presidential race. There’s even a brief TikTok dance interlude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9Q7zs"&gt;The whole experience is complimented by some fantastic pixel-art graphics and great musical choices. Check out some more screenshots below, or better yet, &lt;a href="https://2020game.io"&gt;give it a go yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
