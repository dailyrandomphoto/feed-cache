    <title>Elizabeth Holmes’ defense likely includes testimony accusing her ex-partner of abuse</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8IvmAU"&gt;With just a few days left until Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes faces criminal fraud charges at trial, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21050910-elizabth-holmes-motion"&gt;newly unsealed court documents&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/837408a5-d9ad-4620-bba3-0cc422fc978b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) reveal evidence that her lawyers may cite in her defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBUXve"&gt;If you don’t remember the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11458798/theranos-blood-tests-elizabeth-holmes-ceo-news-controversy"&gt;details from the scandal&lt;/a&gt; as described in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com%2Fbooks%2F549478%2Fbad-blood-by-john-carreyrou%2F9781524731656%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646130%2Ftheranos-elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, documentary, and more than one podcast series, Theranos told investors it developed revolutionary blood test technology capable of amazing results based on just a few small drops. Theranos had been valued at as much as $9 billion before &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; exposed its inaccurate results and use of modified machines by other companies to perform crucial testing instead of its own Edison device. The company folded in 2016, and federal prosecutors &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/cases-of-interest/usa-v-holmes-et-al/USA-v.-Holmes-18-CR-00258-Dkt-469-Third-Sup-Indictment.pdf"&gt;charged Holmes and Balwani&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) two years later for wire fraud, listing investors and patients as victims of their deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RAckz7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elizabeth Holmes’ legal team said she is ‘highly likely’ to testify&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRXyFZ"&gt;That brings us to 2019 and 2020 when lawyers filed these documents in an eventually successful attempt to sever the two as defendants. They are public now &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/cases-of-interest/usa-v-holmes-et-al/USA-v.-Holmes-18-cr-00258-EJD-Dkt-881-Dow-Jones-Mtn-to-Intervene-and-Unseal.pdf"&gt;due to a challenge&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phwQUm"&gt; Holmes’ lawyers argued that for over a decade, she and Balwani — who was 20 years older and met Holmes when she was an 18-year-old Stanford student — had an abusive relationship that included “monitoring her calls, text messages, and emails; physical violence, such as throwing hard, sharp objects at her, restricting her sleep, monitoring her movements; and insisting that any success she achieved was because of him,” as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/28/elizabeth-holmes-plans-to-claim-at-trial-that-ex-boyfriend-and-theranos-business-partner-abused-her.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3v7ROj"&gt;While it’s not certain what strategy will be used in Holmes’ defense, the Wall Street Journal notes that her lawyers wrote it’s “highly likely Holmes would testify” about Balwani’s abusive behavior. Balwani’s lawyers also filed seeking separate trials, denying those claims of abusive behavior and said her allegations would prejudice potential jurors. According to his lawyer Jeffrey Coopersmith, “Ms. Holmes’ allegations are deeply offensive to Mr. Balwani, devastating personally to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luOF8T"&gt;The documents submitted by Holmes’ lawyers show they’ve collected testimony from experts that could be used in a mental-health defense, arguing that she suffers from PTSD, intimate-partner abuse syndrome, and depression due to Balwani and another incident. According to the filings revealed by the Wall Street Journal, they could argue that “a result of her deference to Mr. Balwani, she believed that various representations were true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk0DrO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458585/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial-jury-selection"&gt;Jury selection&lt;/a&gt; for the Elizabeth Holmes trial is set to begin on Tuesday in San Jose, with Balwani’s trial scheduled to begin in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is threatening to withhold Windows 11 updates if your CPU is old</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DG34fHd3L9z2hxZWWJ9-QaJiW64=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788173/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YqpVl9"&gt;Yesterday, we wrote how Microsoft’s Windows 11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes"&gt;won’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; leave millions of PCs behind&lt;/a&gt; — the company told us it won’t actually block you from installing Windows 11 on a PC with an older CPU, so long as you download and manually install an ISO file all by yourself. But it turns out even that technicality has a technicality. Microsoft is now threatening to withhold Windows Updates from your copy of Windows 11 — potentially even security updates — if you take that route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWELFv"&gt;We’re not sure why the company didn’t mention it in our original briefing, but Microsoft has since told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that unsupported PCs won’t be entitled to receive Windows Updates, and that even security and driver updates may be withheld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RYnKE5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CYA or genuine threat?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0iOD9H"&gt;It’s quite possible this is just a cover-your-ass measure on Microsoft’s part. It’s hard to imagine that Microsoft wouldn’t issue critical security patches, when we’ve often seen the company extend support and offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21082228/microsoft-windows-7-black-wallpaper-fix-update-support-patch"&gt;the occasional free patch&lt;/a&gt; even after it’s shelved an operating system for good. If I were in Microsoft’s shoes, I might just want to discourage people from thinking I was offering a warranty and technical support for every possible PC configuration under the sun to avoid potential legal headaches down the road. Better to underpromise and overdeliver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gqppk5"&gt;But it’s also possible Microsoft genuinely does mean to withhold patches at some point in the future — potentially even at launch. Microsoft declined to clarify things further at this time, which suggests the company’s perfectly happy for us to assume this is a genuine threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqiZ5i"&gt;It’s not just security updates at stake, by the way: If you’re unwilling or unable to replace your older-than-Intel 8th-Gen-CPU, Windows 11 could theoretically be an operating system where you go back to the days of manually downloading driver updates for all your hardware, something I haven’t needed to think about for years. Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/windows-10-day-one-1719864054"&gt;wowed me from day one&lt;/a&gt; by seamlessly working with my aging laptop, so it’d suck if that’s not the case anymore. (Admittedly, the generic drivers that ship with Windows are often good enough.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRokl1"&gt;Feature updates are probably less of a big deal: if you’re the kind of person who would install a Windows 11 ISO on your computer to begin with, you can probably download a newer ISO the next time there’s a major Windows update that you want, and do an in-place-install. I just reformatted my machine with the Windows 10 2H21 ISO, and I barely had any patching to do afterwards. But I suppose Microsoft could change its mind about system requirements for future ISOs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkbyYZ"&gt;Why leave us in the dark? My best guess is the one I offered yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643275/windows-11-upgrade-system-requirements-pc-health-check"&gt;when I wrote how “The Windows 11 upgrade situation just got less and more confusing”&lt;/a&gt;: the company seemingly wants to push Windows users to buy a new PC, whether they need one or not. Yesterday, the company told us about a loophole that could placate some of the company's vocal power users who don’t want to give up their old hardware. But if that loophole gets in the way of Microsoft’s plans, the company is reserving the right to make it far less attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google allegedly offered Netflix a break on the usual Play Store commission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_MURAXxjAl9CjKO5fMO7Qp5SFI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788152/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nXg4ra"&gt;An antitrust lawsuit filed against Google and its Play Store by several state attorneys general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;echoed the Epic vs. Apple battle&lt;/a&gt;, and a new document highlights how and why Google’s app store is so similar. &lt;em&gt;MLex&lt;/em&gt; senior correspondent Michael Acton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398632134037505"&gt;points out the new complaint&lt;/a&gt;, which arrived Friday night from lawyers &lt;a href="https://kaplanfox.com/news/1428-google.html"&gt;appointed to represent consumers&lt;/a&gt; (that’s us) in a potential class-action lawsuit that joins the states and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; in accusing Google of abusing its monopoly power and of anti-competitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Similarly, Netflix, Spotify, and Tinder, some of the nation’s largest and most popular subscription services, have repeatedly sought to bypass Google Play Billing. In particular, Netflix wanted an alternative payments system. Apparently in an effort to ameliorate this displeasure, Google offered to take a significantly reduced revenue share percentage to Netflix. Not all developers, however, have met with Netflix’s success, even though many have sought to use their own payment systems.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDZZ58EPymQbhEBf50byIn2h5nI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22811596/google_netflix_feesa.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MLex, CONSOLIDATED FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, CASE NO. 3:20-CV-05761-JD - 42&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jkqa9z"&gt;Perhaps most telling is a mention that popular subscription services like Spotify, Netflix, and Tinder have tried to find ways around Google Play Billing and that 30 percent cut. This is no secret, as the direct collection of credit card info by Netflix and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/technology/google-play-store-30-percent.html"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; resulted in Google posting a “&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/09/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html"&gt;clarification&lt;/a&gt;” explaining that Play Store apps must use Google’s billing system and giving them a year to change. In this filing, the lawyers accuse Google of offering Netflix a “significantly reduced revenue share” with the apparent intention of squashing its desire to use an alternative payments system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLEUqN"&gt;While we haven’t seen the details or timing of this supposed pitch or, it’s a direct reflection of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;things we learned in the Epic vs. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt;, where Apple emails show it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;offered a series of sweeteners to keep Netflix on its in-app purchase system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kYgI66"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store is too big to change","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22645070/apple-app-store-policies-purchases-cut-fees-change-class-action"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RLbdsx"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokeswoman says “All developers are subject to the same policies as all other developers, including the payments policy.  We’ve long had &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/continuing-to-boost-developer-success.html"&gt;programs&lt;/a&gt; in place that support developers with enhanced resources and investments. These programs are a sign of healthy competition between operating systems and app stores and benefit developers.” Whether that’s a sign of healthy competition is arguable, as Google’s efforts largely match those from Apple, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502152/google-play-store-android-apple-app-store-subscription-revenue-cut"&gt;cutting the commission on subscriptions by half after a year&lt;/a&gt;, although it does go further in offering&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt; a 15 percent cut to developers on their first $1 million in revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2U2qo"&gt;Google’s standard 30 percent commission is still a major target, as the suit cites internal Google figures suggesting the break-even level for revenue sharing is actually about six percent. The complaint quotes Google internal communications that admit setting the “arbitrary fee” at 30 percent has “[n]o rationale, other than copying Apple.” And as far as competition, the lawyers cite Google estimates that even a major player like Samsung could only manage $100 million in revenue for 2019, while Google raked in around $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SDQZg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3 - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Google?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Google&lt;/a&gt; calculated could break even with a 6 percent commission fee on Play Store - compared to 30 percent&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Acton (@MActon93) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398632134037505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FSjl9s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/"&gt;Google’s response to the state AGs in June&lt;/a&gt; said the Play Store “provides more openness and choice than others,” and that on Android “you can choose to download the app from a rival app store or directly from a developer’s website.” However, this filing pokes holes in that argument as well, pointing out that Google’s OEM agreements with phone manufacturers interfere with making other app stores as easy to access as the Play Store, which they must include on a device’s home screen in order to pre-load Google apps like Gmail and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For apps distributed through the Google Play Store, Google in its DDA with app developers imposes multiple anticompetitive restrictions. First, it prohibits developers from distributing to their existing customers outside of Google Play, either by (1) using customer information to contact them directly or (2) steering those customers within the app to another store or to the developers’ own website." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TZrvNyjU0HY25-TBrr1moBLJFTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22811593/google_dda.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="stQ6rl"&gt;In a timely call-out, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html"&gt;it cites the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement&lt;/a&gt; that forbids developers from using information about customers that they get from the Play Store, like email addresses, to directly reach them. You can read the relevant section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LCP47a"&gt;4.9 You will not engage in any activity with Google Play, including making Your Products available via Google Play, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the devices, servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any Authorized Provider. You may not use user information obtained via Google Play to sell or distribute Products outside of Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iY2caL"&gt;That makes it “impossible for developers to directly reach customers to offer alternatives to Google Play Store,” according to the suit. Allowing developers to use information from the App Store to contact customers with emails including information about alternative payment options is one of the small concessions Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;made in its proposed class action settlement earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, although companies like Spotify and Epic say that doesn’t go nearly far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe charger and the latest GoPro highlight this weekend’s best deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3CK8E198tvDEWPA5BaR5GVKhuJ4=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69787554/akrales_201018_4238_0464.0.12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe makes for a convenient charger around the house&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdpAZu"&gt;The ecosystem of MagSafe chargers for the iPhone 12 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;might not be very expansive&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to go wrong with Apple’s base magnetic wireless charger — especially when it’s discounted to $30 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The magnetic puck can provide the iPhone 12 Mini with up to 12 watts of power or the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro with up to 15 watts, so long as you use a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt;. It can also top off other iPhones that support wireless charging without magnets. In fact, it can power up any device that supports Qi charging, including AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D0rzh1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10676303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GEdaz"&gt;It’s not too late to seek out some fun and adventure before the summer winds down, and this GoPro deal could help you document it. The GoPro Hero 9 Black is a rugged little action cam capable of capturing 5K video and 23.6-megapixel photos. It’s versatile enough to record underwater footage or capture a timelapse sequence, and portable enough to be worn or placed into any situation for a unique perspective. The GoPro Hero 9 Black is on sale from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DK5ZH44?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — its best price ever — saving you $50 and (hopefully) helping motivate you to live a more exciting life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7QUlF5"&gt;School is about to be in full swing, and if you’re looking to pick up one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops available&lt;/a&gt;, the M1-equipped MacBook Air should be at the top of your list. Apple’s new chip makes for lightning-fast performance, which is further buoyed by great battery life, a revised scissor-switch keyboard, and the ability to run iPhone and iPad apps natively. The only thing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559478/apple-m1-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-design-same-chip-transition-hardware"&gt;hasn’t really changed&lt;/a&gt; since its Intel-based predecessor is the laptop’s iconic, wedge-shaped design, which, given the excellent build quality, isn’t necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1F4X"&gt;Although the 2020 MacBook Air recently dropped to as low as $850, it’s back up to its typical sale price of $899 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604825-REG%2Fapple_mgn63ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22644815%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-gopro-hero-9-black-action-cam-m1-macbook-air-xbox-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, now its second-best price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="asazSb"&gt;If there ever was an Xbox controller that took a cue from the abstract expressionist movement of the late 1940s, the &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller would be it. The forthcoming Xbox Series X / S controller — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639740/xbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller"&gt;revealed during the Gamescom&lt;/a&gt; 2021 Xbox stream — is more vibrant than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607786/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-aqua-shift-special-edition-blue-rubber-side-grips"&gt;recently-announced Aqua Shift controller&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox Series X / S, with a translucent-yellow build, splashes of color, and joysticks designed to match the aesthetic. It also comes with some exclusive &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;DLC, though it won’t arrive until the game launches on November 9th. Normally $75, you can &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-Forza-Horizon-5-Limited-Edition-for-Xbox-Series-X-S-Xbox-One-and-Windows-10-PCs%2F168090079" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder now for $6 off at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store is too big to change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufI18ykJAB9-tAqCIK2pLV2KwXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69787458/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVSgM1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;Apple made waves this week&lt;/a&gt; by announcing a $100 million settlement with small app developers who sued the company. But despite the changes announced yesterday, nothing is really changing for developers — the App Store is too big and too reliant on in-app purchase fees for that to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuyIpb"&gt;Apple’s settlement &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22645070%2Fapple-app-store-policies-purchases-cut-fees-change-class-action" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;includes several new policies&lt;/a&gt; that it says “clarif[y]” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;the App Store’s rules&lt;/a&gt;. Developers can now contact customers about alternative payment methods using data collected from their app (so long as the notification itself is done outside their apps), which they had previously been barred from doing. Apple promises to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces Apple’s revenue cut down to 15 percent for developers who make less than $1 million a year, in its current state for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PQim7S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s $100 million settlement agreement changes a key App Store rule for developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u3QmCZ"&gt;The same goes for organizing its search results by “objective characteristics” like downloads, star ratings, and text relevance. Developers can set new price points for apps, and Apple promises to give them more information about how appeals work. It also plans to publish an annual transparency report about the App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSGOpw"&gt;But none of this is likely to make much of a difference in the long run to how the App Store actually works, or how the developers who make most of its money work with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XMtMd"&gt;This settlement gives concessions to small businesses on the App Store, but a handful of huge companies make most of the money on the App Store itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8F86jh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An estimated 98 percent of App Store developers are considered “small businesses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ud2urf"&gt;While Apple itself didn’t give any numbers on how many of its developers fall into the “small app” category of making less than $1 million, a SensorTower report from late last year claimed that roughly 98 percent of all App Store developers qualify for the program. That report also noted that those developers — which Apple calls the “vast majority” of iOS app developers — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;only account for 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the App Store’s total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slglWg"&gt;The economics of the App Store in 2021 are rules set by one multitrillion-dollar company to capture revenue from in-app transactions on the 2 percent of developers that account for 95 percent of commerce on Apple’s platforms. And all these rules and regulations and settlements and clarifications are to mollify the vast majority of developers who are effectively just bystanders caught in that larger crossfire. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJRKx8TEuwF2n_56VKmkMbwIgzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689244/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gw1be"&gt;So what does Apple care if it has to give up $100 million here (the payout from its latest class action suit) or $59 million there (the estimated yearly cost to Apple of the Small App Business program)? As long as it’s able to defend the 30 percent cut of purchases that flow through its store from the bigger developers and apps, it can give whatever concessions it needs to on things like search rankings or new price points for apps to settle class action suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BSTlV"&gt;Apple’s biggest change, the option to discuss alternate payment methods, also has a hidden edge. Developers are now allowed to discuss alternative payment methods for subscriptions or services outside of their app using contact information obtained in the app — for example, they can now offer a form to submit an email address to sign up for deals to be sent to your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRvlLw"&gt;But if you want to actually sell something &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;your app, you still have to use Apple’s payment methods (and pay Apple’s cut), something that’s still a major point of contention for a lot of developers. And as last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;dramatic fight between Apple and Hey&lt;/a&gt; showed, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;not always easy to bypass Apple’s payments&lt;/a&gt; even if you are willing to jump through Apple’s hoops and only sign up users outside the app, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBkyOQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store runs on subscription and in-app purchases from a relatively small number of developers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTPQC5"&gt;The simple fact is that the App Store is a massive business for Apple at this point, and in 2021, the business of the App Store &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases and subscriptions. Consider the top-grossing apps offered on Apple’s store. &lt;a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/apps/ios/top/"&gt;App Annie’s list&lt;/a&gt; of 50 top grossing is absent any paid apps; &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/all-categories?date=2021-08-27"&gt;SensorTower’s list of 200&lt;/a&gt; includes just one, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; (at 109th place as of publication time, and as a game that notably also features in-app purchases). The biggest moneymakers on the platform — and therefore, the biggest moneymakers for Apple — are all free-to-play games, streaming services, and subscription-based apps that rely on customers buying and subscribing through Apple’s payments processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DWeDc"&gt;With the amount of money at stake here, Apple was never going to make it possible (or even easier) for developers to alert users to alternative payment methods within their apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYBcNg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;App Store was estimated&lt;/a&gt; to bring around $64 billion in sales in 2020. Factoring in the company’s 30 percent cut, that works out to roughly $19 billion in revenue for Apple. Though the actual number is likely slightly smaller, given that Apple offers reduced 15 percent cuts for things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;for subscriptions after a year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvPAHh"&gt;But at the end of the day, Apple was never going to budge. The App Store is too big and too important to the company, and the way the App Store works in 2021 means that — unless a court decides otherwise, as Epic, Spotify, and others are actively trying to do — nothing will really change for the core parts of the app economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkmXD1"&gt;And that, of course, is something that Apple’s clarifications won’t interfere with at all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your iPhone 12’s earpiece failed, Apple might fix it for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hA8Nb3FZLVe0e23sXqlok6_Yg5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69786179/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oX86cP"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;announced a service program&lt;/a&gt; to fix failing receivers on iPhone 12 and 12 Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apple-launches-new-iphone-12-service-program-for-no-sound-issues/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company says that non-Mini or Max phones made between October 2020 and April 2021 may have an issue where no sound comes out of the earpiece when making or receiving calls, and that it’ll fix the issue for free as part of the new program. According to Apple, the problem is caused by a component in the receiver module failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o14osJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;Apple’s page&lt;/a&gt; says that only a “very small percentage” of devices may be affected. While it can be hard to tell what Apple means by “small percentage” (it &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks"&gt;infamously used the phrase&lt;/a&gt; when describing the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;butterfly keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that experienced issues), it doesn’t appear that the earpiece issue is widespread — searching for reports of failing receivers on Reddit or Twitter only turned up a few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9OQk3M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The issue covered doesn’t seem widespread&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAPIFk"&gt;Still, for those with these phones, it’s nice to know that if your earpiece starts to go you’ll have some recourse. While all iPhone 12s are still under Apple’s one year warranty, the service program covers devices for two years after purchase, giving your earpiece an extra year of coverage. There is one thing to note if you’ve got this problem and are looking to send your phone in, though: Apple says that if your screen is cracked, it’ll have to be fixed before it’ll carry out the receiver repair. While the earpiece fix won’t cost you anything, the screen damage repair could, so just be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBPwF3"&gt;Apple also says that phones “will be examined prior to any service” to make sure they’re eligible for the program. This likely means that you won’t be getting a free fix if you’re like me and broke your phone’s receiver by accidentally spilling boiling hot pickling liquid into it. C’est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus orders new series Players from American Vandal creators  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57Zg2qatvSEm-uieOMnRCQwAt4o=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785956/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pkZ2j"&gt;Paramount Plus has ordered a new documentary-style comedic series titled &lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt; that will delve into a fictional professional League of Legends esports team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrvIMu"&gt;The series is co-created and executive produced by Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, the comedic minds behind Netflix’s critical breakout&lt;em&gt; American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;, which memorably gave us a pair of riveting — albeit disturbed — mysteries about fictional crimes involving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339154/american-vandal-netflix-mockumentary-making-a-murderer-instagram-snapchat-documentary"&gt;dick vandalism&lt;/a&gt; and the mastermind behind an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763640/american-vandal-season-2-jokes-comedy-netflix"&gt;explosive diarrhea incident&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i0mHf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt;, also a mockumentary, will follow an esports team gunning for a championship after years of misfortune. The series will involve a clash of egos between a 17-year-old rookie, the team’s “prodigy,” and a veteran 27-year-old. What could &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; go wrong? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pCHy7X"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwrr6aIWeus?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZzqXV"&gt;Yacenda, who directed FXX comedy series &lt;em&gt;Dave&lt;/em&gt;, will direct &lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt;. The series is being produced by CBS Studios in partnership with Funny Or Die, which was attached to Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;. Paramount Plus offered sparse detail about the series beyond stating Players “will explore the world of esports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ymrato"&gt;But given that &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;’s two-series run delivered frankly inspired plotlines about penis graffiti and a Turd Burglar — somehow managing to set a new bar for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339154/american-vandal-netflix-mockumentary-making-a-murderer-instagram-snapchat-documentary"&gt;future of documentary storytelling&lt;/a&gt; in the process — we’re in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZksHbZ"&gt;Paramount Plus (formerly CBS All Access) has only had a handful of originals that drummed up any significant fanfare. But given the cultural impact of &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt; — which managed to make us seriously ask ourselves, “Who dick the dicks?” — this series has the potential to be one of the service’s biggest comedy debuts since it launched.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chicago sues DoorDash and Grubhub for ‘unfair and deceptive’ practices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LmSdJcox8yz86YXH_dWaB9nNBy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785693/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUlMKV"&gt;The city of Chicago has sued food delivery services DoorDash and Grubhub for allegedly using deceptive and unfair tactics that hurt restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic. The two lawsuits accuse the services of a panoply of misconduct, including falsely advertising delivery services for restaurants without their consent, charging misleading fees to customers, and hiding the costs that they added to a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1hwXl"&gt;“It is deeply concerning and unfortunate that these companies broke the law during these incredibly difficult times, using unfair and deceptive tactics to take advantage of restaurants and consumers who were struggling to stay afloat,” &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2021/august/LawsuitGrubhubDoorDash.html"&gt;said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot&lt;/a&gt;, who filed the complaints alongside Acting Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) Commissioner Kenneth Meyer, and corporation counsel Celia Meza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F2GyUb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is deeply concerning and unfortunate that these companies broke the law during these incredibly difficult times”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="achhBT"&gt;The suits apparently stem from a collaboration between the BACP and the City of Chicago Law Department, and they assert claims based on the Chicago Municipal Code. But they echo incidents cited in other lawsuits and public controversies. &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2021/August/GrubhubComplaint.pdf"&gt;Grubhub’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, claims the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21206019/grubhub-restaurants-250-discounts-coronavirus"&gt;harshly criticized “Supper for Support” discount&lt;/a&gt; “was so deceptive that it was forced to issue corrective statements nationally.” Among many other issues, it also singles out &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/grubhub-phone-order-call-fee-coronavirus"&gt;Grubhub’s practice&lt;/a&gt; of publicizing phone numbers that direct callers to restaurants but quietly add their own fees, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19154220/grubhub-seamless-fake-restaurant-domain-names-commission-fees"&gt;making “imposter” versions&lt;/a&gt; of restaurant websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAXM1M"&gt;Grubhub denied the accusations. “We are deeply disappointed by Mayor Lightfoot’s decision to file this baseless lawsuit. Every single allegation is categorically wrong and we will aggressively defend our business practices. We look forward to responding in court and are confident we will prevail,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Grubhub says it discontinued phone orders on August 23rd, although users can still place a Grubhub order through a representative over the phone, and it no longer makes the websites in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A03giV"&gt;This is the second recent government lawsuit against Grubhub. In July, Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-sues-grubhub-for-charging-restaurants-illegally-high-fees-during-covid-19-public-health-emergency"&gt;Attorney General Maura Healey sued it&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly exceeding a local 15 percent cap on fees to restaurants — a charge that is also present in the Chicago complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCC74Y"&gt;DoorDash is similarly accused of getting around &lt;a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2021/5/26/22455048/chicago-third-party-delivery-cap-extension-blocked-doordash-grubhub-uber-eats"&gt;Chicago’s 15 percent cap&lt;/a&gt; with a $1.50 “Chicago Fee” that “misleadingly conveyed to consumers that the city was imposing this fee and receiving the money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y8krVt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The claims echo earlier complaints about both companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6g5dCb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2021/August/DoorDashComplaint.pdf"&gt;DoorDash’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; also includes a shot against the company’s tipping policy — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708212/doordash-delivery-tip-theft-policy-change-tony-xu-tweets"&gt;which solicited “tips”&lt;/a&gt; to pay drivers’ existing wages rather than actually passing them on as a bonus. (DoorDash announced that it would change the policy in 2019.) “DoorDash misled consumers in Chicago to believe that they were using the ‘tip’ feature on the DoorDash Platform to supplement the income of the driver who delivered their food, over and above the base pay DoorDash provided. Instead, DoorDash largely used the consumer’s ‘tip’ to subsidize its own agreed payment to the driver,” the suit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfHbbB"&gt;DoorDash also denied the suit’s merits. “This lawsuit is baseless. It is a waste of taxpayer resources, and Chicagoans should be outraged. DoorDash has stood with the City of Chicago throughout the pandemic, waiving fees for restaurants, providing $500,000 in direct grants, creating strong earning opportunities, and delivering food and other necessities to communities in need,” said a spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Last year it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/doordash-settles-lawsuit-for-2-5m-over-deceptive-tipping-practices/"&gt;settled a Washington, DC lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over its tipping policy for $2.5 million; the settlement did not include an admission of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook are struggling with ivermectin misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An assortment of boxes and blister packs of ivermectin." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0QoalsRfAt7z-3oDu9GxwDoUvg=/0x34:5333x3589/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785427/1232982770.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivermectin tablets.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E4ieLf"&gt;TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook are dealing with waves of content about ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug that has picked up traction among anti-vaxxers as a COVID-19 treatment. Sales of ivermectin meant for animals, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/ivermectin-covid-19-warning-injuries/index.html"&gt;calls to poison control centers&lt;/a&gt;, have increased enough that the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;issued a consumer update&lt;/a&gt; explaining why people shouldn’t take it to treat or prevent COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mMCeoU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4"&gt;https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1429050070243192839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ML7E7P"&gt;On TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/tiktok-covid-cures-ivermectin-horse-deworming-medication-1216268/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found videos, some of which had more than a million views, promoting ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment under tags like #ivermectin4covid and #ivermectinworks. TikTok has since removed the videos for violating community guidelines and blocked the tags, and a spokesperson says TikTok will continue removing related videos and hashtags. The #ivermectin tag is still up, though many of the most popular videos in the tag are of healthcare professionals debunking misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWxMYR"&gt;On Reddit this week, moderators of several hundred subreddits &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgx3gw/reddit-responds-to-calls-from-moderators-to-fight-disinformation"&gt;called on the platform&lt;/a&gt; to take action against COVID-19 misinformation, including banning subreddits that spread medical disinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoILsj"&gt;Disagreeing with the requests for outright bans, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/"&gt;shared a response&lt;/a&gt; in r/announcements, saying “Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus.” The post goes on to say that Reddit will take action when people promote fraud or encourage harm, as well as quarantine certain subreddits so that they don’t appear in searches and can’t be accessed without logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yInsW6"&gt;Moderators &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/pcb67h/response_to_yesterdays_admin_post/"&gt;criticized Huffman’s post&lt;/a&gt;, saying subreddits that promote the use of ivermectin encourage harm but have been allowed to stay. According to a spokesperson, Reddit is currently reviewing r/ivermectin and related communities on the site. Reddit recently &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgqmg/reddit-quarantine-nonewnormal"&gt;quarantined r/NoNewNormal&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-mask, anti-vax subreddit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Q9pXG"&gt;People in Facebook groups have also been sharing misinformation and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ewzn/facebook-is-allowing-ivermectin-ads-at-a-time-when-it-really-shouldnt"&gt;making sponsored posts&lt;/a&gt; that promote and advertise ivermectin for treating or preventing COVID-19. Facebook has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583809/joe-biden-facebook-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-killing-people"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of COVID-19 misinformation that circulates on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAF2LO"&gt;According to a spokesperson, Facebook removes content “that attempts to buy, sell, donate or ask for Ivermectin.” They added, “We also enforce against any account or group that violates our COVID-19 and vaccine policies, including claims that Ivermectin is a guaranteed cure or guaranteed prevention, and we don’t allow ads promoting Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19.” Still, public and private anti-vax groups try to dodge moderation by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;using euphemisms&lt;/a&gt; like “ivm” or “moo juice” for ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKriKU"&gt;TikTok, Reddit, Facebook, and other social sites have struggled throughout the pandemic to reckon with the rapid spread of medical misinformation. Platforms have updated their policies, added links to authorities like the CDC, and removed millions of posts. But as the pandemic continues and misinformation evolves, real solutions — social distancing, masking, and vaccines — remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Windows 11 upgrade situation just got less and more confusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGSt4A9X-ruvQycynGCOIo0iVaE=/0x46:2100x1446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785174/Windows_11_PC_Devices.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQhjbJ"&gt;In June, we wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;that Windows 11 will leave millions of PCs behind&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly because their processors aren’t as new and fully featured as Microsoft would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKX5Su"&gt;This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22408235"&gt;Microsoft revealed a change of plan to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it won’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; abandon those millions of PCs, because you’ll be able to manually install the downloadable Windows 11 ISO on whatever you want. The company’s also extending its official CPU compatibility list to a bunch of Intel’s most expensive Xeon workstation processors and its most expensive line of Core X desktop CPUs — and, tellingly, the less powerful Intel chip it shipped in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102490/microsoft-surface-studio-2-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Surface Studio 2&lt;/a&gt;, so it no longer has to defend the idea of abandoning a flagship product &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Studio-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that it still continues to sell brand-new&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4yjY3"&gt;But while it might seem like Microsoft’s opening up the floodgates, the confusing reality of Windows 11 upgrades hasn’t changed&lt;em&gt; quite&lt;/em&gt; as much as you might think. While DIY PC gamers, IT admins, and other power users will be able to perform a clean install of Windows 11 on existing hardware dating back years, it’s not encouraging that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdUaK2"&gt;First and perhaps most important, Microsoft informed us after we published this story that if  your computer doesn’t meet the system requirements, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646035/microsoft-windows-11-iso-workaround-no-update-guarantee"&gt;it may not be entitled to get Windows Updates, even security ones&lt;/a&gt;. We’re asking Microsoft for clarification on that now. But secondly, it still sounds like Microsoft will be encouraging millions of people to replace their perfectly good Windows PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxQa4u"&gt;Imagine for a moment that you’ve never heard of an ISO; you’re hoping to upgrade your aging machine to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;the refreshing yet familiar Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; this fall; and you want to know if it’ll work. You might well fire up Microsoft’s PC Health Check app, because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550951/microsoft-pc-health-checkup-app-update-windows-11-compatibility-tool-details"&gt;that’s the exact tool&lt;/a&gt; the company is advertising for that purpose. But that tool might lead you astray. Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that app will still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;check your CPU against Microsoft’s list of supported processors — and direct you to “relevant support articles that include potential remediation steps” if you don’t have the chips that Microsoft prefers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="MjsgFY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10721063"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjcUZB"&gt;Most Windows PC owners probably won’t bother with a compatibility checker app, of course. They’ll just wait for the Windows Update that can automatically bring it to them for free, much like how Windows 10 was a free update when it arrived in 2015. But here, again, Microsoft will only be updating computers with supported CPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUgCBn"&gt;Avoiding automatic updates for CPUs that aren’t supported makes some amount of sense: Microsoft doesn’t want to be blamed if it makes your Windows experience worse, and it can’t test every single configuration under the sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1dREi"&gt;But how much worse is worse? Microsoft makes it sound pretty bad at first, writing that it saw 52 percent more kernel mode crashes (aka the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559852/microsoft-windows-11-black-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-change"&gt;BSOD&lt;/a&gt;) when testing systems that didn’t meant its minimum spec — whereas machines that did meet it had a 99.8 percent crash-free experience. But if you do the math, it means we’re going from a 2-in-1,000 chance of a BSOD to a 3-in-1,000 chance. That additional amount of downtime might not be acceptable for a sysadmin managing thousands of older computers, but it’d likely be a different story for the average person who only buys a new PC every four to six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jy9S0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;As we’ve explained before&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has some valid security reasons to insist on more stringent hardware requirements like TPM 2.0, particularly from its laptop and desktop partners. The company’s been targeted by some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22551193/microsoft-customer-support-tools-solarwinds-hackers-nobelium"&gt;extremely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;troubling&lt;/a&gt; attacks and would like to prevent more, but it only has so much leverage over the PC industry to make sure security features are actually turned on. (Microsoft has technically mandated TPM 2.0 &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-tpm"&gt;since July 2016&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Xlmx"&gt;None of this will be a problem for those who simply buy a new computer with a preloaded copy of Windows 11. But that’s my point — now that Microsoft has revealed it’s not actually locking Windows 11 to those security features, the list of supported CPUs feels even more like a gift to Intel and PC manufacturers in the form of extra computer sales (where Microsoft profits off each Windows 10 license) than a staunch security play. And it’ll be a shame, particularly for the environment, if people wind up tossing PCs that are perfectly capable of running the new OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0RzNv"&gt;As security expert (and former Microsoft threat intelligence analyst) Kevin Beaumont &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617"&gt;put it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s motivations are questionable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VbB3Gv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In the middle of a pandemic when orgs are hurting, with a global chip shortage, MS are trying to get people to replace things for security reasons that are questionable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a Surface? No. Make a better OS.&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYpJv4"&gt;Microsoft is potentially about to push lots of people toward buying a new computer this fall, and PC manufacturers will be only too happy to help. I just wonder how shameless Microsoft will be as time goes on: when it comes to promoting its own Microsoft Edge browser, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/17/21520315/microsoft-install-office-pwa-web-app-without-permission-update-word-powerpoint-excel"&gt;disrespected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;its own users’ choices&lt;/a&gt; with forced Windows Updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVL7TM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:57 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Windows 11 updates may be in jeopardy if you take the ISO install method with a PC that doesn’t meet the company’s system requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USTSdr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 28th, 2:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a link to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646035/microsoft-windows-11-iso-workaround-no-update-guarantee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; explaining what we know so far about updates for systems that don’t meet the requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
