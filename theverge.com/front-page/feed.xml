    <title>Logitech’s $70 G335 is a colorful wired gaming headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G335 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL_kj5UIyDbwhDgn41E1igH_zbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518822/g335.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MLyvc3"&gt;Logitech announced its new G335 wired gaming headset &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-audio%2Fg335-gaming-headset.981-001023.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F29%2F22555522%2Flogitech-wired-g335-gaming-headset-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that’s available for preorder now at $69.99&lt;/a&gt;. It’s expected to ship in July. The G335 borrows several design elements from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21378026/logitech-g733-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-accessories-g203-g305-g915-colors"&gt;$129.99 G733 wireless model released in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, including its expressive color options (as well as a new mint colorway), the comfortable bungee headband, breathable ear pads, a volume dial built into the right ear cup, and a flip-to-mute microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yUjz1"&gt;This more affordable model is compatible with the G733’s replaceable headband straps and mic covers sold through Logitech’s site, but it does away with most of that headset’s fancier features, like USB-C charging and the strip of RGB lighting on the front side of the ear cups. Logitech says this wired model has a slimmer design for “a smaller fit and increased comfort.” It weighs 240 grams, which is about 40 grams less than the wireless model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APWMqC"&gt;The G335 comes with a 3.5mm cable attached, which ensures support with many devices that have an audio jack, be it a PS5 or Xbox Series X console controller, a PC, tablet, a laptop, or something else. Logitech includes a PC splitter to accommodate computers that have separate microphone and audio inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQO9h7"&gt;It’s best not to expect too much from a $70 wired headset, but I loved the design and fit of the G733. And if the audio performance is anything like the pricier wireless model, the G335 could be easy to recommend at its price point. We’ll be testing this one out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mario Golf: Super Rush isn’t weird enough</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYIs7JsV6lwPcCOBcMZFZ127G8I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518778/Mario_Golf_Super_Rush_Special_Shot_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pGSanC"&gt;At their best, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; sports titles move beyond the game they’re trying to mimic. You don’t have to care about cars or racing to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, just as you don’t need to know who Pep Guardiola is to have fun with &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Strikers&lt;/em&gt;. The sport is just a starting point. From there, Nintendo’s designers expand on it with all kinds of interesting and new ideas. &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush&lt;/em&gt;, which is out now on the Nintendo Switch, does &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of this. There are familiar characters with superpowers, courses with strange obstacles, and a new mode that’s supposed to emphasize speed over all else. Ultimately, though, &lt;em&gt;Super Rush &lt;/em&gt;ends up feeling a little too much like, well, golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYypz5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; at least gets the basics right. Swinging a club feels good, and that’s true whether you’re using a standard controller or &lt;em&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/em&gt;-style motion controls. It manages to walk the line Nintendo games so often do, where it’s easy to pick up but also offers a good amount of depth once you start learning how different clubs work and how to add spin to your shot. The act of playing golf works well enough, and it’s augmented by some very Mario features, like outlandish obstacles (you can use tornadoes to give your ball a boost into the air) and character-specific powers (there are special shots that freeze the ground on impact or generate an annoying lightning storm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONzyh1"&gt;That’s all fine if you just want to play a few rounds with friends. But many of the modes get in the way of the fun, and &lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; is particularly grueling if you’re looking to play solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32rr2O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5cViCVKOZQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRzn2w"&gt;First, there’s the “speed rush,” the game’s titular innovation, a mode that’s geared more around speed than precision. The idea is that after you take your shot you run after the ball to take the next as quickly as possible. The faster you are, the better your score. In practice, though, running around on golf courses is tedious and actually slows things down; it takes me longer to run 160 yards than it would for the game to just zap me there. This might be forgiven if the act of running was enjoyable, but instead you’re saddled with a rapidly depleting stamina gauge and a limited range of actions (including a mostly useless jump) that turn the whole process into a chore. (To make matters worse, if you finish a hole quickly, you still have to sit and watch your opponents play, even in the single-player modes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDDiGR"&gt;There’s also an “adventure” mode, which plays out sort of like a simple golf RPG. You play as a Mii character going through the process of becoming a Mushroom Kingdom pro. You’ll travel to different courses, talk to characters, earn skill points to upgrade your Mii, and take on bosses. It’s a nice idea, but it never rises to the level of past games in the series, like &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Advance Tour&lt;/em&gt;, which leaned much heavier on the roleplaying elements and had a surprisingly entertaining narrative. Instead, it’s a largely flat story that had me skipping through the dialogue in order to get to the next tournament. (Which, usually, meant playing more speed golf.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NzhoxBppX3NdSb6_tybtJZRtUbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688594/Switch_MarioGolfSuperRush_ND_SCRN_05.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DDfhWm"&gt;The highlight of the package is “battle golf,” easily the fastest mode in the game. It’s a nine-hole course that takes place in a giant stadium where the goal is to sink three shots first, while navigating things like Thwomps and bombs. It’s basically the &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; ethos but for golf, and it’s a lot of fun. Even better, matches are over very quickly, making it an almost ideal party experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEZ5jM"&gt;I couldn’t help but wish that more of the game had the same zany, Nintendo-like feel of battle golf. I wanted more oddball courses and modes, more chances to get into weird situations. Instead, the solid mechanics and colorful world are dragged down by a story mode with a bland story, and a sped-up version of golf that’s actually pretty slow. There’s still fun to be had, particularly with two people hitting balls on the same Switch. But while &lt;em&gt;Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; gets the golf part right, it’s lacking what makes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yscprx"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot challenges BTS to a boy band dance-off in latest video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGYRKnVUYXlSwBIY63ntmFKKQ3Q=/68x0:790x481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518477/bts.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vv7HX4"&gt;Hyundai has officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/29/22205055/boston-dynamics-robots-spot-atlas-handle-dancing-video"&gt;completed its acquisition of Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of the internet’s favorite dancing Spot and Atlas robots (which only occasionally look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881385/boston-dynamics-atlas-gymnastics-routine-somersaults-split-leap"&gt;dystopian nightmare machines&lt;/a&gt;). And to celebrate, the company is &lt;a href="http://blog.bostondynamics.com/all-together-now"&gt;collaborating with K-pop sensation BTS&lt;/a&gt; on a new video that shows seven Spot robots grooving to the band’s 2020 song “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7atZfX85nd4"&gt;IONIQ: I’m On It&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEXcyZ"&gt;And while Spot’s smooth dance moves might bring a frisson of worry to any K-pop fans thinking that K-pop boy-bands might be the next industry that Boston Dynamics is targeting for its robots to replace human workers in, right now it seems that BTS isn’t too worried about the competition. A &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJZeMgqQMjA"&gt;second video&lt;/a&gt; shows off the band celebrating the Hyundai acquisition alongside a Spot robot, and both boy band and bot come together for a brief dance-off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lIAGGXtDx39fe8WAB-agJIDQsxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688468/qAVfNwtrU2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aSyQMA"&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://blog.bostondynamics.com/all-together-now"&gt;behind-the-scenes blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company details how it pulled off the longer, coordinated dance routine, which involved incredibly precise programming (rather than using the robot’s built-in sensors or obstacle avoidance algorithms that Spot usually uses to get around and accomplish tasks). “Everything had to be worked out in advance and scripted precisely,” explains Eric Whitman, a Boston Dynamics roboticist. The company also worked again with Monica Thomas, the professional choreographer who the company worked with on its previous dancing robot videos, to plan out Spot’s dance moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6DOo6"&gt;“An athletic performance like dance stresses the mechanical design of the robot, and it also stresses the algorithms in the software,” says Marc Raibert, founder and chairman of Boston Dynamics, in an explanation as to why the company keeps making these videos. Raibert also notes that the dance routines force the company to create new tools to program the robots, like the “Choreographer” software used here — software that’s since been publicly released and is already being used by other Boston Dynamics Spot owners for entertainment purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IBGCKL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJZeMgqQMjA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="5GXfag"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Boston Dynamics robots take over the dance floor in latest video","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/29/22205055/boston-dynamics-robots-spot-atlas-handle-dancing-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="l4Bs5F"&gt;That hits on the second reason for the videos, which Raibert doesn’t touch on: they’re incredibly popular online. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw"&gt;last dancing video has over 32 million videos&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube, and a collaboration with BTS, one of the most popular bands on the planet with an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; active fan base, is almost guaranteed to put up even better numbers. And given the fact that Boston Dynamics is actually trying to get companies to &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; Spot robots — to the tune of $74,500 each — it’s easy to see why it’d want to get the word out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDguz8"&gt;The dancing videos also help to show off the fun, playful side of the Spot robots, cementing them in the public mind as cute dancing machines, rather than the more controversial real-world uses in which the robots have been deployed. That includes things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409559/nypd-robot-dog-digidog-boston-dynamics-contract-terminated"&gt;NYPD’s since-ended tests of Spot robots&lt;/a&gt;, or the recent use of Spot robots in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;simulated military exercises in France&lt;/a&gt; for reconnaissance work.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ pocket-sized Zenfone 8 arrives in the US for $629</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yEHHL5644LQCTKR9BdFKziKHhz8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518340/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ZenFone 8.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="putYtw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;, Asus’ well-specced and compact competitor to the iPhone 12 mini, has launched in the US. The company is currently selling two versions of the phone on &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/category/ZF8"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a model with 128GB of storage which will eventually sell for $629 once its early bird pricing of $599 expires on July 13th, while the other has 256GB of storage and costs $699. Both are equipped with 8GB of RAM and are compatible with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks, but not Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jrkGR"&gt;We liked the Zenfone 8 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;reviewed it last month&lt;/a&gt;. Its 5.9-inch display makes it a relatively compact device in comparison to the rest of the Android market, and its 120Hz refresh rate and Snapdragon 888 processor mean it feels snappy and responsive to use. Its smaller size means its battery life is only okay, and its camera performance could be better, but those might be acceptable compromises if a compact phone is your priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="att6JM"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430948/asus-zenfone-8-flip-price-specs-availability"&gt;larger Zenfone 8 Flip&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a flipping camera mechanism that turns its three rear cameras into selfie shooters, isn’t currently planned for a US release. In Europe, the 8 Flip costs €799, compared to €599 for the regular Zenfone 8.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Alexa trick is helping kids read</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KMHMWfolFM35lOWdOYmmGaJF_qE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518198/dseifert_201025_4263_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MndFny"&gt;Amazon has announced a new feature for its Kids Plus service on Fire tablets and Echo smart speakers called Reading Sidekick. Designed to help kids improve their reading skills and ability, the Reading Sidekick allows kids to read either physical or digital books along with Alexa by taking turns at reading the books aloud with the digital assistant. The Reading Assistant is included in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home"&gt;Kids Plus service&lt;/a&gt; that comes with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F5Z2MC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kids edition Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-Kids/dp/B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo speakers&lt;/a&gt; or as a $2.99 per month ($4.99 without Amazon Prime) or $69 per year ($99 without Prime) subscription plan and is available starting June 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLeKnM"&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with most Alexa-enabled devices, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21452312/amazon-echo-dot-led-redesign-sphere-features-alexa-price-release-date"&gt;Echo Dot Kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16631956/amazon-echo-plus-alexa-smart-home-review"&gt;Echo Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Amazon Kids mode is enabled on the smart speaker or smart display (through the Alexa smartphone app), a child can then say “Alexa, let’s read” to start the Reading Sidekick. They will then be prompted to choose a book, either physical or digital on a Fire tablet or in the Kids Plus app on other devices; opt to read a lot, a little, or take turns; and then begin reading the book. Amazon says that “over 700” books are available in the system now, with more releasing each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4glTSZ"&gt;Once a book is started, Alexa will listen to the child’s reading and automatically assist with pronunciations or other challenges while reading the book. It will provide encouragement through phrases like “good job!” when a child finishes a book or gets through a particularly tricky section. In the “read a little” mode, it will take the lion’s share of the reading, expecting the child to follow along in the book and then read one page or paragraph every few pages. The “read a lot” mode is the opposite: the child will be expected to read four pages consecutively, with Alexa reading one after that. The “take turns” mode is simple alternation of reading a single page or paragraph between the child and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wMolH"&gt;What the Sidekick doesn’t do is follow up with any sort of comprehension questions to see how much the child retained or understood from the book. There’s no test or quiz component; it’s best to think of this as edutainment than a replacement for a proper learning curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with both audio-only Echo devices and ones with screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading Sidekick suggestions on an Amazon Echo Show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fIiJ2p"&gt;The Reading Sidekick works with both Alexa smart speakers and smart displays, but it won’t show the text of a book on a smart display’s screen, and instead uses that real estate for book recommendations. Alexa can also provide recommendations on a basic Echo speaker, so it’s not necessary to use the Reading Sidekick with a screen. Parents can view the books their kids have been reading on the Kids Plus web dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji30Qf"&gt;Amazon says that it is also starting to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/11/16460120/amazon-echo-multi-user-voice-new-feature"&gt;Alexa Voice Profiles&lt;/a&gt; for Kids this week. This will allow the Echo to recognize the voice of a specific child and then personalize the experience to them, which can be helpful when multiple children are sharing a single Echo device. If the child is speaking to an Echo that doesn’t have the Kids mode enabled and Alexa recognizes their voice, it will switch into Kids mode and provide age-appropriate answers, filter explicit music, limit calls and messages to approved contacts, and limit access to approved skills. Parents will be able to set up to four unique voice profiles for their kids in the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q91TTX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen, small updates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FJXmsa"&gt;In an interview ahead of today’s announcement, Marissa Mierow, Amazon’s head of Alexa learning and education, said that the Reading Sidekick is “meant to build fluency and a love of reading” within children and that Amazon developed it because of how closely reading skills are related to success in academics and social life after school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WpDjN"&gt;The company says it took nearly a year to build this feature, adjusting Alexa’s patience, ability to detect when a child is sounding out a difficult word and understand kids’ pronunciations, and more. Mierow says the company put together an advisory council of teachers, science researchers, and curriculum experts to help guide the development of the service as it was being built. It’s releasing the feature now in a hope that it will help combat the “summer slide” in reading ability that happens when kids are out of school for six to eight weeks between grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf457v"&gt;Mierow says the “sweet spot” age range for the Reading Sidekick is six to nine, as the child needs to have some reading ability to follow along with Alexa, even in the most simple modes. Most of the books in the supported library are aimed at these beginning readers, though there are some more advanced books for older kids who want to use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DM3c6Hi0Hw43Ldk3yUKRFM01isg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687724/Screenshot_20210628_195627_copy.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Reading Sidekick section on Fire tablets for kids shows all of the supported books.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vXVCoq"&gt;I had an opportunity to try out the Reading Sidekick with my six-year-old ahead of today’s announcement. We were able to test reading physical and digital books with Alexa on both a standard Echo Dot with Kids mode enabled and the recently released Echo Show 5 Kids Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhwzWU"&gt;Based on our experience, the ideal setup for Reading Sidekick is a Fire HD Kids tablet (or the Kids Plus app on an iPad or similar device) and an audio-only Echo speaker. Though the Reading Sidekick works with physical books, my child had a hard time keeping up with Alexa as it read, since turning the page requires swifter dexterity than just swiping the screen like they can do with a digital book on a tablet. Additionally, the tablet can access the entire library of books that are compatible with the service, whereas it might be hit-or-miss with the books you have at home. (Though Amazon will highlight physical books in its store that are compatible with the Reading Sidekick.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13iGlm"&gt;On the Echo Show, the Reading Sidekick app would frequently quit to the homescreen and start displaying a clock or the weather, even though Alexa was still listening to my kid reading. This was confusing for them, as they’d stop reading when they noticed that the screen changed. The recommendations on the screen are also duplicative of the recommendations on the tablet itself, rendering the screen mostly moot — the experience was just better with the speaker-only Echo. Naturally, it works best in a quiet room where Alexa can hear a child’s voice easiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ewc0k"&gt;The Reading Sidekick crashed in the middle of reading a book on both devices — Alexa would just stop listening to the book and we’d have to start the whole process all over again. We were able to pick up where we left off, but it’s an annoying process and I’m not sure my kid would have been able to figure it out without me there helping them through it. Amazon says this isn’t something it saw during beta testing of the Reading Sidekick, but it’s possible that it’s related to the company expanding availability of the feature from the preview group I was in to the general population of Echo owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJjWP9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Sidekick did help my child through difficult sections automatically and corrected pronunciations on a handful of words&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="93uuoa"&gt;When the Sidekick was working as expected, it did help my child through sections they were having trouble reading automatically and attempted to correct some of their odd pronunciations. It also rewarded them for finishing a book with a message of encouragement. But once we were done testing the feature, my kid just wanted to play with the apps and games on the Fire tablet and didn’t have much interest in reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKTA2b"&gt;There are, of course, some immediate concerns with having your kid read with a robot. One is privacy, though if you already have an Echo speaker in your home, this isn’t really any different from that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nBok9"&gt;The larger concern might be that with the Reading Sidekick, Alexa is taking the traditional place of a parent or teacher in teaching reading. Many parents cherish the time spent teaching their children to read and see it as both a developmental and bonding activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXLVt"&gt;Still, plenty of parents would love their kids to read more than they do and just don’t have the time to devote to it due to the many obligations of modern life. The ability to have their child practice their reading with Alexa to supplement any reading they might do together as a family might be appealing. Unlike a parent, Alexa won’t ever tire of reading the same book over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncql1N"&gt;Parents will have to reckon with their anxieties over privacy and an Amazon-powered robot teaching their child, but they’ll also have to deal with the decently hefty hardware requirements. This service requires at least one Amazon device and a subscription to the Kids Plus service. It really works best when you have both an Echo speaker and a Fire HD tablet (or another tablet with the Kids Plus app), doubling the number of devices you need to buy or already own to get the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXNhqu"&gt;The Reading Sidekick is an example of Amazon figuring out more ways to make Alexa and its artificial intelligence useful in our lives, while of course keeping things within the Amazon ecosystem as much as possible. It’s also unlikely to be the last educational tool given to Alexa: many kids already use the virtual assistant to help with simple mathematics and other trivia questions. It’s not a leap to think that’s where the Alexa learning and education team might be headed next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram tests letting anyone share a link in stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBa_TpHHPy8XKdh8rzDPXAtrkXw=/84x0:996x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518247/199306424_1004326343706419_871286131944844992_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AIwu2A"&gt;Instagram has always limited who can post swipe-up links to their stories, but today, the company is starting a new test that could widen that ability. In this case, however, it isn’t a swipe up that people will be able to offer, but instead a linking sticker. These stickers will operate the same way a swipe-up link does, except with a tap instead of a swipe. People will also be able to respond to stories that include a sticker, which they can’t currently do with stories that have a swipe up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJLQVA"&gt;For now, the test is small, and Vishal Shah, Instagram’s head of product, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s mostly to learn how people might take advantage of links. They’ll be watching for the types of links people post while keeping a particular eye on misinformation and spam. Plus, stickers, he says, fit more into the current way people use the platform, so he says this test “brings links into the same kind of overall system, which from a simplicity of system perspective, also makes a lot of sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSAvDZ"&gt;He adds that link stickers are the eventual goal for Instagram, whether that be for everyone or just people who already have linking privileges. “That is the sort of future system we would like to get to,” he says. “And that’s what we hope to roll out, if we’re able to make this work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBw4E0"&gt;Links will be limited to stories for now, however. Shah says there’s “no plan” to bring them to the feed or any other part of the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHdAV6"&gt;This test seems mostly targeted at people who’ve found a voice and reach on the platform, but maybe not to the levels that Instagram requires to gain swipe-up privileges. (Users have to be verified or have at least 10,000 followers.) Activists, for example, have mastered the art of call-to-action posts but haven’t been able to direct people to website resources. This might make that possible. Again, it’s only a small test, so the platform won’t rapidly change overnight, but it might be the start of people web browsing from within the Instagram app more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Basilisk Ultimate includes a $50 Steam gift card at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLUq_e7DnVgillg93-lOtiGw-A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518106/akrales_191104_3773_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PT8LeW"&gt;Best Buy is offering an attractive deal on Razer’s Basilisk Ultimate wireless gaming mouse that includes a charging dock. The current price is $40 off, and you’ll get a $50 gift card to Steam for no extra cost. Amazon is selling this mouse for a similar price, but the Steam gift card bundle is exclusive to Best Buy. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Steam is looped into this deal since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549213/valve-steam-summer-sale-halo-sekiro-hades-horizon-zero-dawn"&gt;its big Summer Sale is happening&lt;/a&gt;, bringing discounts to many digital PC games through July 8th. This $50 could get you several games or pay for all of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfPMXK"&gt;Compared to other mice in Razer’s lineup, this one has perhaps the most features. The scrollwheel can tilt for extra inputs, the DPI clutch for your thumb is handy for sniping or making other precise movements, and the resistance of the scrollwheel itself can be tweaked with a dial on the Basilisk Ultimate’s bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yb9zbo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10392735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sVLs8s"&gt;
&lt;p id="lJqSyH"&gt;Both Woot and Best Buy are offering solid discounts on Intel’s 9th Gen Core i9-9900K eight-core processor (3.6GHz base clock, 5GHz boost). It costs $310 at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142085?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fintel-core-i9-9900k-8-core-processor%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_cp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744799110096238949" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $316. It’s not a bad deal for a high-end model that, despite releasing in late 2018, should still be a very solid performer for gaming and other processor-intensive tasks for years to come. When it launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950968/intel-9th-gen-core-chips-2018-desktop-processors-8-core-i9-9900k" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Intel called the i9-9900K the “best gaming processor in the world.”&lt;/a&gt; Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554245/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-intel-7th-gen-amd-zen-1-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s definitely modern enough to meet the requirements&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 11 — murky as those currently are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5uOvB"&gt;In case you weren’t aware, Intel’s 11th Gen CPUs require newer motherboards that support the LGA 1200 socket size to fit correctly. The 9th Gen processors have an LGA 1151 socket that makes them compatible with &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2Fpl%3FN%3D100007627%2520601304476" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;motherboards that are often more affordable&lt;/a&gt; than ones made to fit Intel’s latest processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1wL9Ih"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10629169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hFF7hv"&gt;
&lt;p id="T5xG42"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch A8H OLED 4K television &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084KQFNBX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $1,298 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its original $1,900 price. This model sold for $100 less during Prime Day last week, and it was a very popular deal. But whether you missed out or just decided to hold off, this certainly isn’t a bad deal if now is a better time to buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Palm Pre home button was the first to be the last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3zOV8whYGjc86JbBpmaliPhGlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69518062/dbohn_210622_4651_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Palm Pre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naZwsh"&gt;Physical home buttons are all but extinct on modern smartphones, and the Palm Pre ended them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwC9oK"&gt;It’s not hard to notice that smartphones have steadily shed their buttons throughout the years: keyboards, numpads, call and hang up buttons, directional navigation keys, and more have all fallen to the wayside in favor of more versatile touchscreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vucRL"&gt;In 2007, the iPhone — with its then-revolutionary 3.5-inch multitouch display — helped to push that trend along by reducing navigation down to a single home button. But even as touchscreen sizes grew and buttons fell away, the humble home button stubbornly stuck around. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/28/18244645/apple-home-button-user-interface-iphone-7-fake"&gt;Apple wouldn’t ditch the button&lt;/a&gt; for over a decade, when the iPhone X arrived in 2017.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSuMvH"&gt;But it was the Palm Pre, and its largely unnecessary center button, that showed home buttons could be removed for good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8Hu0k23dB3Ulpv_sx22hS6AC3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687394/dbohn_210622_4651_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pre’s home button (left) and the button-less Pre 2 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSwpP4"&gt;The original Pre, launched in 2009, may not have seemed like the harbinger of home button doom. After all, the Pre &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a home button, at least for its first iteration. But crucially, the Pre’s home button was effectively a vestigial organ — an appendix that evolution hadn’t quite managed to weed out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tOma6B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptp40g"&gt;Pressing the Pre’s home button did exactly one thing: brought up webOS’s “Card” app switcher, something that could also be accomplished with a swipe gesture. Everything else about the Pre’s navigation was focused instead on the touch-sensitive area around the button. Gestures were used to return home, go back a screen, pull up a dock of favorite apps, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODSrpW"&gt;The home button itself served more as training wheels for users used to seeing one on other touchscreen devices, rather than a necessary part of the user experience, one that was wholly optional to the actual function of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmxlaN"&gt;It’s no wonder that just a year later the Pre 2 would go on to skip the nearly useless button entirely in favor of an illuminated LED strip for gestures. That familiar-looking white pillbox has been aped by the modern iterations of both iOS and Android for multitasking gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1BGztDEjtgjW8jLrUt6LGbni7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22687393/dbohn_210622_4651_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T5dhxV"&gt;There were, of course, issues with Palm’s implementation: some of the gestures were unintuitive, and for users making the jump from a more traditional Palm device, there were a lot of new concepts that had to be learned from scratch. Conversely, more modern smartphones benefit from the advantage of users who are far more familiar with touchscreen interfaces, along with far more real estate to make those gestures work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iG3NY"&gt;But while the Pre would ultimately fail, it still stands out in history as arguably the device with the ultimate home button in the history of smartphones — and as the first device to prove that gesture-based navigation could actually succeed in replacing home buttons. And taking a look at any popular smartphone in 2021, it’s clear that at least in that regard, Palm was way ahead of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSUc2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNF1f5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the HP Pavilion Aero 13.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xk5yit"&gt;HP has announced the Pavilion Aero 13, the lightest consumer laptop yet. It has a maximum weight of 2.18 pounds (0.987 kg), making it one of the most portable laptops you can buy of any type or size. It’s also powered by AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, up to a Ryzen 7 5800U. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl8jF0"&gt;On the outside, the Aero is available in four colors: pale rose gold, warm gold, ceramic white, and natural silver. Weight isn’t the only thing getting slimmed down, as this is the first Pavilion with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. The Pavilion has traditionally been HP’s budget line, with a bigger and clunkier design than the company’s pricier lines, but HP has been shrinking the bezels and chassis footprints on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276459/hps-pavilion-x360-convertible-laptops-streaming"&gt;a number of its models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen will reach 400 nits of brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGxre"&gt;It’s not surprising that this product will be AMD-only. The latest Ryzen generation has been running more efficiently than competing Intel chips across the board. Since they require less heavy-duty cooling to run well, the 5000 generation has enabled manufacturers to put out impressively thin and light systems this year. Razer was able to release its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;thinnest and lightest Blade laptop ever&lt;/a&gt; with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900HX inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i95U4P"&gt;Ryzen chips are also a reasonable fit for the Pavilion line, since many have been priced lower than comparable 11th Gen Intel chips recently. While AMD systems have been making their way into higher-priced tiers over the past few years, price is still one of the primary areas where they’re competitive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Ryzen-powered Zenbook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt; has made a statement as one of the most affordable OLED systems currently on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYFIGD"&gt;The Aero 13 OLED will be available in July for a starting price of $749. &lt;/p&gt;
