    <title>TikTok TV app now available on Samsung smart TVs in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lzcO5727wCrXDwjjqcLu0h-ET18=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511065/TikTok_PR_w_2_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok’s TV app is now available on Samsung smart TVs in the UK.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGAw62"&gt;TikTok is launching an app on Samsung smart TVs in Europe, allowing users to scroll through their For You feeds and see other TikTok videos, the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-and-tiktok-launch-tiktok-app-on-samsung-smart-tvs-in-europe"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The TikTok TV app is available in Samsung’s app store and is compatible with 2018 and newer models. It will come preinstalled on all new Samsung TVs. The app will roll out to users in the UK first. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iu0rZ3DVy6C9Xbnwa0UZ86bcYsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169388/TikTok_PR_w_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok / Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ItKCw0"&gt;The app displays videos from a user’s feed in a strip across the top, with videos in different categories to check out. According to the news release from Samsung, users can like, view, and comment on trending videos and block or mark content they’re not interested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkGYo1"&gt;TikTok videos will continue to be displayed with a vertical aspect on TVs, the company confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gU012g6GBvu3szgSGi_0ffYCMJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169390/TikTok_PR_w_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok / Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7SntWH"&gt;The Samsung app is different than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;More on TikTok app the company launched on Amazon Fire&lt;/a&gt; TVs in August. The Fire TV app includes interviews with creators and a “This is TikTok” category to spotlight creators on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM2z5N"&gt;The Fire app is essentially a container app of curated content, TikTok says, while the Samsung app is closer to what users see in the mobile app. Neither requires a TikTok account to view content, but users who log in to the Samsung TikTok app will receive more personalized content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwdBz4"&gt;According to mobile analytics firm App Annie, when combining info from iOS and Android, TikTok was &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90584368/tiktok-beats-out-facebook-to-become-the-top-app-worldwide-by-downloads-in-2020"&gt;the most-downloaded app of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNv2P1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s chaos made America a sitting duck for cyberattacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyber-Attack Defense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSmfiNNEbm3hqEv9WVz-jgjKxNU=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510872/863052542.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Former CISA director Christopher Krebs.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo By Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7lvE1X"&gt;On Sunday night, as news broke of one of the broadest state-sponsored cyberattacks in recent memory, former civilian cybersecurity chief Christopher Krebs was stuck tweeting. A state-sponsored attacker linked to Russia had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;compromised senior-level cabinet agencies&lt;/a&gt;, implicating huge portions of the government and private sector. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21562844/us-cybersecurity-election-official-christopher-krebs-fired-president-trump"&gt;Fired in November&lt;/a&gt; from his role leading the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) after &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-senators-criticize-trumps-firing-of-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs/"&gt;a political spat with President Trump&lt;/a&gt;, Krebs had to watch it all take place from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngEsZL"&gt;“I have the utmost confidence in the CISA team and other Federal partners,” Krebs said. “I’m sorry I’m not there with them, but they know how to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BtX7ng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m sorry I’m not there with them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmFhJL"&gt;While it’s hard to say if he would have handled the hack differently, Krebs’ position on the sidelines underscores just how ill-prepared the United States is for a compromise of this scale. For the past four years, Trump has treated the federal cybersecurity effort as one more partisan battleground, with attacks and vulnerabilities embraced or rejected largely on the basis of their value as a political cudgel. Faced with a government-spanning compromise that will require deep analysis and careful cooperation, there’s little trust left to draw on, which could make a bad problem even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CD1FUT"&gt;To understand the challenge facing CISA and the rest of the government, it helps to understand the frustrating structure of this latest hack. The early headlines focussed on agencies like the departments of treasury and commerce, but the hack is much broader than that, and we still don’t know precisely which systems may have been compromised and what data may have been taken. Digging out every possible compromise will take discretion and trust — the kind of qualities Krebs had been building up in his role and lost when he was abruptly shown the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krbg3N"&gt;The heart of the hack is a network management tool &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion"&gt;from a company called SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt;. State-sponsored attackers compromised that tool, enabling them to deploy malicious code to anyone using the system, disguised as a software update. Experts are still piecing through the details (there’s a detailed technical writeup from Microsoft researchers &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and a more accessible explanation from the journalist Kim Zetter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1338389130951061504"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but the gist is that anyone who used the product was potentially exposed. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/1338514528829665283"&gt;a financial filing earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, SolarWinds estimated that roughly 33,000 clients were vulnerable to the malicious updates, with “fewer than 18,000” actually infected. (It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/politics/us-agencies-hack-solar-wind-russia/index.html"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;last week’s compromise&lt;/a&gt; at the cybersecurity firm FireEye.) It’s a huge hack, spanning vast and sensitive portions of both the federal government and the private sector — and we’re still in the process of figuring out what’s affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QO8elY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is no way to run the world’s most powerful intelligence apparatus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u1UdDk"&gt;As you might expect, CISA (Krebs’ former agency) has been at the heart of the government response. In &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/12/13/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-mitigate-compromise-solarwinds-orion-network"&gt;an emergency alert sent late on Sunday night&lt;/a&gt;, the agency called on every federal agency to assess their exposure, with reports due at noon on Monday. There’s a natural inclination to hide the damage (no one likes seeing headlines about how they might have been hacked), but an effective response depends on agencies being brutally honest. It’s the only way to understand the scale of the mess and start to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnoeEe"&gt;Tackling that mess will take a lot of work and trust. Cybersecurity is a difficult job under the best of circumstances, and while the National Security Agency keeps military secrets locked down, civilian agencies (like treasury and commerce) are often left with few resources to fend for themselves. The result has been an embarrassing string of hacks, from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach"&gt;the China-linked compromise of the Office of Personnel Management in 2015&lt;/a&gt; (which, among other things, leaked the fingerprints of every federal employee) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/13/8212107/state-department-hackers-email-russia"&gt;a string of hacks at the State Department&lt;/a&gt;. Federal agencies have a terrible record of protecting data over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzF6wM"&gt;Given a renewed mandate in 2018 to address the disastrous security at US civilian agencies, CISA hasn’t had much time to work — but under Krebs, the agency was gaining trust. The director had bipartisan support and was seen by the cybersecurity community as an impartial arbiter, someone who would be honest about the facts on the ground even if it was politically inconvenient. Then, a few weeks ago, he was fired for displaying exactly these qualities. As Trump raised groundless claims of election fraud to distract from his loss at the polls, Krebs issued a clear statement on the issue, saying he had seen no evidence of vote tallies being changed in the election. In a matter of days, he was out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="46F5Hj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The government only works when we insist on it working&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2nfQYX"&gt;We shouldn’t overstate Krebs’ work in preventing the hack itself. The SolarWinds compromise dates back to March, so it happened on his watch. There’s no indication that the past few months of compromise would be any less ugly if Krebs were still in the director’s chair. But the incident response &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be less ugly. Acting director Brandon Wales hasn’t been confirmed and has held his position for less than a month. In the midst of an unusually chaotic transition, he’s asking agency infosec leads to trust him through one of the most sensitive events of their working lives. It’s a difficult position under the best of circumstances, and it would be much, much easier with a trusted hand in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIMVjJ"&gt;It’s all the worse because Krebs’ firing is just the latest in a long chain of similar incidents. President Trump took office actively denying the role of Russian active measures in the 2016 election, despite an unusually definitive attribution by US intelligence agencies. In the years since, he’s taken any suggestion of Russian influence as a personal incident and made denying it a kind of loyalty test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcW0Lz"&gt;Put simply, this is no way to run the world’s most powerful intelligence apparatus. I am not naive enough to call for a return to bipartisan comity, but we should be able to agree on basic facts like threats, vulnerabilities, and attackers. But the hazy nature of attribution has turned cybersecurity into a partisan battleground and ensured that nothing gets done on either side. Over the past four years, far too many Republicans have responded to persistent Russian attacks by insisting that &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/avatar-there-is-no-war-in-ba-sing-se/"&gt;there is no war in Ba Sing Se&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G0AYu"&gt;We may hope that when Trump leaves office in January, however begrudgingly, this pattern will start to change. President-elect Biden has made &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2020/11/biden-team-highlights-cybersecurity-focus-first-cabinet-picks/170274/"&gt;promising moves&lt;/a&gt; in his federal cybersecurity staffing, and at the very least, we can expect a return to the mild competence of the Obama era. But the past four years have taught us that institutions only improve through active effort, and the government only works when we insist on it working. In the wake of one of the most devastating compromises in federal history, it’s time to insist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 has arrived with ProRAW for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 Pro camera app in use" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2qMsMMZNsBnOi0Z23G2uJ_9sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510836/akrales_201017_4238_0016.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;With iOS 14.3, the iPhone 12 Pro camera app will support a new kind of RAW image capture | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TnaGT5"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.3 has arrived, giving iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max owners the ProRAW feature that was promised when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504764/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-screen-size-5g-features-price-release-date"&gt;devices were announced&lt;/a&gt;. Other features in this update include search improvements for the Apple TV app, support for Fitness Plus  — Apple’s new subscription-based workout service — and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;recently announced AirPods Max headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iIXoU"&gt;iPhones have long been able to capture RAW images, but doing so has meant giving up the benefits of all the computational magic that happens when shooting a standard image with the native camera app. ProRAW is designed to address that: it’s a format that combines the computational benefits of Apple’s image processing with the post-processing flexibility of a RAW file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqPupH"&gt;In iOS 14.3, Apple is flipping the ProRAW “on” switch for iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max — and those two devices only. With the update installed, ProRAW image capture and editing will be enabled in the native camera and photos apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y0fbua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oth5QR"&gt;This update also addresses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169881/apple-iphone-ios-14-text-messages-no-notifications-bug"&gt;an irritating bug&lt;/a&gt; where some users weren’t getting notifications for new incoming messages. And on the lighter side, Siri gets an update with hundreds of animal, instruments, and vehicle sounds. The new feature works on HomePod, iPhones and iPads; just ask Siri what sound a humpback whale makes and you’ll get a demonstration. If you’re on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll also get a visual to go along with the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTutb"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/08/ios-14-3-release-candidate-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, 14.3 also makes it easier to customize app icons since home screen shortcuts no longer need to open the Shortcuts app. Other iOS 14.3 highlights include the ability to record video at 25fps, updates to Apple TV app search and a new Apple TV Plus tab, front-facing camera mirroring in still photos for devices from the iPhone 6S and newer, and new Cycle Tracking features in the Health app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches new App Store privacy labels so you can see how iOS apps use your data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foLTsv1S9sSgbk_TvqGmKOS1qiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510737/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nyix9w"&gt;Apple is making good on its promise to provide more transparency around iOS app data collection with the launch of new privacy labels on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzS8jj"&gt;The company first announced its intention to provide these so-called “nutrition label” privacy disclosures &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;back in June during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, and last month Apple disclosed that developers would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;provide this information by December 8th&lt;/a&gt; or risk losing the ability to update their apps. Now, following that deadline, Apple is launching the feature officially for all iOS device owners running the latest version of iOS 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6tEa"&gt;Apple says the new labels will be required for apps on all of its platforms — that includes iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — and they will have to be up to date and accurate every time a developer submits a new update. Apple is also holding itself to the same standard, something the company clarified last week when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;Facebook-owned WhatsApp criticized the company&lt;/a&gt; for an apparent inconsistency in its requirements, before Apple said it, too, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;provide labels for all its own software&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cszf52"&gt;The company’s own first-party apps will all have the same disclosures on their App Store product pages. In the event an app doesn’t have an App Store product page because it cannot be removed, like the Messages app, Apple says it will be providing privacy label information on the web. Every piece of software on the App Store will also have its privacy label viewable on the web, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p6KlEhLz0kQr5rC5lJ6tl5cQVTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168998/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R49pJY"&gt;As for how the labels are structured, Apple has broken down data collection into three categories: “data used to track you,” “data linked to you,” and “data not linked to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Mg0q"&gt;Tracking in this context means the app developer is linking data from the app — like personal information, or data collected from your device, such as location data — with other data from other companies’ apps or websites for the purpose of targeted advertising or some other ad-related metric. Apple says it’s also using the term tracking here to mean sharing user or device information with companies that sell it, like data brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7m37s"&gt;The “data linked to you” portion of the label is any data that can be used to identify you. That means data gleaned from using the app or having an account with the service or platform, and any data pulled from the device itself that could be used to create a profile for advertising purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKBRDn"&gt;“Data not linked to you” is the portion of the privacy label that clarifies when certain data types, like location data or browsing history, are not being linked to you in any identifiable fashion. Apple has specific, developer-focused information on the new labels &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;at its developer portal page&lt;/a&gt;, with more general information available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.com%2Fprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174017%2Fapple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the consumer-facing page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjT8f"&gt;This isn’t the last of Apple’s major privacy changes coming with iOS 14. The company intends to release a new privacy feature requiring developers to ask for explicit permission to track iOS device users across apps and websites using a unique device identifier, called an IDFA (or Identification for Advertisers) code. The plan was to require this with the launch of iOS 14, but Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would delay the feature until some time next year, to give developers more time to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8bGSNF"&gt;Apple is offering two-hour delivery for just $5 on “eligible in-stock items” from its retail stores. If you need to get a gift for an Apple-loving person in your life this holiday season, that $5 shipping could be a handy way to get that gift in a pinch. The company says it offers scheduled courier delivery of eligible items “in most metros.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQkRCI"&gt;That low $5 fee won’t last forever, though — in the fine print on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fshipping-pickup&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it’s a limited time offer. And you can’t use it on customized Macs, engraved products, or orders paid with financing or by bank transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAVkF1"&gt;If you don’t need your purchase within two hours, Apple says it offers free next-day delivery on any in-stock Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, or Apple Watch, and free two-day delivery on “almost everything else.” The company also has a useful guide that lists &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fholiday-shipping&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174360%2Fapple-two-hour-delivery-price-holidays#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;when you’ll need to order a product&lt;/a&gt; in order to get it by December 24th with free shipping, though some items, like the HomePod mini, are already unavailable for delivery by Christmas Eve with free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9st2en"&gt;Apple is also allowing you to initiate returns for “eligible products received between November 10, 2020 and December 25, 2020” until January 8th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japan confirms its asteroid mission returned samples of space rocks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DE3-BXhFn0ajfYvagWGCXBWjLAE=/113x0:1328x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510365/26062018_Hayabusa2_Mascot_Rueckansicht_xl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DLR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zG0MhG"&gt;This morning, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, confirmed that its mission to return samples of an asteroid to Earth did indeed bring home some space rocks. Engineers at the agency found black sand they believe to be from an asteroid inside the mission’s sample container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ituQ08"&gt;It’s great news for the mission, known as Hayabusa2, which launched to space in 2014. The mission sent a spacecraft to an asteroid named Ryugu to collect samples of rocks from the object’s surface and then bring them back to our planet for study. Hayabusa2 wound up scooping up materials from Ryugu twice before heading back to Earth. The vehicle arrived this month, jettisoning a canister filled with the asteroid samples, which then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155825/jaxa-hayabusa2-mission-asteroid-sample-return-landing-australia"&gt;landed in Australia with the help of a parachute on December 5th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="undtiE"&gt;Up until today, JAXA engineers weren’t exactly sure if the spacecraft &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; grabbed any samples. While the vehicle performed all of its sampling maneuvers at Ryugu as planned, the mission team didn’t have a way to confirm that the vehicle held any asteroid materials while in space. They had to wait until today when they opened the sample container in a clean room in Japan for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="18PDSJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The sample container inside the re-entry capsule was opened on December 14, and we confirmed black grains thought to be from Ryugu were inside. This is outside the main chambers, and likely particles attached to the sample catcher entrance. (English release available tomorrow) &lt;a href="https://t.co/NAw1R1cjvy"&gt;https://t.co/NAw1R1cjvy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5BfXxfH29h"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5BfXxfH29h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HAYABUSA2@JAXA (@haya2e_jaxa) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haya2e_jaxa/status/1338469549822201856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UqhDT7"&gt;“The sample container inside the re-entry capsule has been opened,” &lt;a href="https://www.jaxa.jp/press/2020/12/20201214-1_j.html"&gt;JAXA wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “On the 14th of March, a black sand granular sample believed to be derived from the asteroid Ryugu was confirmed inside the sample container.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMWVYk"&gt;The good news doesn’t stop there, as there may be even more asteroid material that the engineers haven’t reached yet. The black sand that JAXA found was located just at the opening of the sample container. There is still a main chamber deeper inside the container that hasn’t been opened yet, which could contain the bulk of the sample. The goal of the mission was to collect up to 100 milligrams of material from Ryugu. Engineers will know if they hit their target as they dive in deeper into Haybusa2’s stores. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft’s game subscription service now supports Google Stadia for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bJh8lP9LWXm3RHdpDZdV4VcISL8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510347/acastro_190528_1777_ubisoft_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t1CkH8"&gt;Ubisoft announced on Monday that its game subscription service, Ubisoft Plus, is adding support for Google Stadia, meaning any subscriber can sign up for a free Stadia account and stream Ubisoft games from the cloud on supported devices. Ubisoft first announced Stadia support in October when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535105/ubisoft-plus-uplay-subscription-service-google-stadia-amazon-luna-pc-gaming"&gt;rebranded from UPlay Plus into its current iteration&lt;/a&gt;, but the cloud gaming integration wasn’t ready at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvECNA"&gt;The rollout will take a few days to reach all users, Ubisoft says, and it’s only available to US subscribers at the moment. Those eligible should be able to find the option to link their Stadia account to their Ubisoft Plus profile from Ubisoft’s website. The company says subscribers will not be required to also purchase Google’s Stadia Pro subscription; because Stadia has a free tier, that’s all you’ll need to stream Ubisoft games, though Stadia Pro does provide 4K streaming while the free tier caps at 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yS7qOZ"&gt;Ubisoft Plus costs $14.99 a month and offers access to PC versions of first-party Ubisoft games, including new releases like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;. Now, with Stadia support, you won’t need a powerful PC to play some of the more recent and technically demanding Ubisoft games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIuG94"&gt;Ubisoft Plus also supports Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525435/amazon-luna-early-access-cloud-gaming"&gt;became available in beta back in October&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5tYHOyUKA0j141UXfEj4RO/ubisoft-now-available-on-amazon-luna"&gt;began supporting Ubisoft Plus last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mVDQB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Health care workers in US start receiving COVID-19 vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-aqZZDQGY2HZM47aPqjgPDrPRc=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510335/1230124244.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Michelle Chester prepares a COVID-19 vaccine in New York.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Mark Lennihan / POOL / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mhdvWp"&gt;Just after 9AM on Monday, Sandra Lindsay, a critical care nurse in Queens, New York, was vaccinated against COVID-19. Lindsay was one of the first people in the United States to get a dose of the newly authorized Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and was the first to get the shot in New York, an early epicenter of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkq4d"&gt;“I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a painful time in our history,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rtyCHM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Breaking: A critical care nurse in Queens, Sandra Lindsay, is the first New Yorker to be vaccinated in a non-trial capacity after the first doses of Pfizer’s vial arrived at Northwell Health this morning. “It didn’t feel any different from taking any other vaccine,” Lindsay said. &lt;a href="https://t.co/KSaYEQUTHE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KSaYEQUTHE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spectrum News NY1 (@NY1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NY1/status/1338490930723217408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4v7N3y"&gt;Lindsay was vaccinated just two days after the Food and Drug Administration issued an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;Emergency Use Authorization&lt;/a&gt; (EUA) for the Pfizer and BioNTech product. The announcement marked the end of a record-breaking push to develop a vaccine against the deadly disease and the start of an unprecedented campaign to vaccinate millions of people in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehaQLL"&gt;As soon as the authorization was handed down, Pfizer’s factory &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/11/world/covid-19-coronavirus#millions-of-pfizer-vaccine-doses-to-be-shipped-immediately-after-fda-approval"&gt;started preparing&lt;/a&gt; doses for shipment. Trucks left the company’s Michigan facility on Sunday, headed for the airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XE8fO5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Breaking - UPS and FedEx trucks carrying the first U.S. shipment of coronavirus vaccine have left Pfizer’s facility near Kalamazoo, Michigan. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Cf32ki9gCF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Cf32ki9gCF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Muntean (@petemuntean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/petemuntean/status/1338116009190944769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oYMpt6"&gt;Shipments touched down all over the country this morning, and other health care workers joined Lindsay as the first group of vaccine recipients. Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center coordinated the first shots after a countdown of “three, two, one, vaccinate.” Staff at Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut got their first doses at an outdoor tent, surrounded by cameras and reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fFNPp4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The first Ohioans have been vaccinated at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OSUWexMed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OSUWexMed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/aPCztnVTww"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aPCztnVTww&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Max Garrison (@m_p_garrison) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/m_p_garrison/status/1338511321864630272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="qBFhfg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And with that, the vaccination has begun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hartford HealthCare’s Dr. Ajay Kumar becomes the first person in Connecticut, and one of the first nationally, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine since its authorization. &lt;a href="https://t.co/DesXwqWlBN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DesXwqWlBN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Putterman (@AlexPutterman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPutterman/status/1338511224577855490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZlkmh"&gt;Other hospitals will take a few more days to begin vaccinations. Boston Medical Center &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mbebinger/status/1338499436457160705"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; to start Tuesday or Wednesday, for example. Some doctors said on Twitter that they still &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notdred/status/1338493555334115329"&gt;haven’t gotten information&lt;/a&gt; about when their shots will be scheduled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H6MhQ"&gt;The FDA is expected to authorize the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the end of this week, and if it does, shipments of that product will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;start to roll out across the country as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAMofq"&gt;Operation Warp Speed, the federal partnership behind vaccine development, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/07/pledge-to-vaccinate-20-million-against-covid19-in-december-seems-unrealistic/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that 20 million people could be vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year. Some hospitals say that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/07/pledge-to-vaccinate-20-million-against-covid19-in-december-seems-unrealistic/"&gt;seems unrealistic&lt;/a&gt; because of the logistical challenges of coordinating shots and shifting expectations around the number of doses they’ll receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99vFgm"&gt;Despite all efforts to accelerate the distribution of the vaccine, COVID-19 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22158376/covid-vaccine-pfizer-public-health-antivirus"&gt;still surging&lt;/a&gt; around the country. It’ll be a few months before the vaccine is able to slow down the spread of death and disease. Still, the first injections are a scientific triumph — and for many people in the US, they are a bright sign of hope at the end of a long, dark year.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom calls are beginning to arrive on the Google Nest Hub Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YkD5zDHpaU9o_8zI9uuBBthB3DM=/280x133:1343x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68510295/Zoom_on_Nest_Hub_Max.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IF4S7P"&gt;Google is starting to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21373661/zoom-smart-displays-facebook-portal-google-nest-amazon-echo-show"&gt;Zoom support for the Nest Hub Max &lt;/a&gt;smart display as an early preview for users in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, the company announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcmoKY"&gt;People who are using a Google or Nest Wi-Fi system may see some improvements to video calls, Google also announced. It’s updating the devices to automatically be able to detect and prioritize video call traffic for Google Meet and Zoom, which may help if your video calls have been a little choppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJNPqN"&gt;As the holidays approach, it’s the perfect time for this update, as more and more people are going to be making video calls to friends and family. Zoom has been an especially popular service this year as social distancing measures and shutdowns have forced people to celebrate together remotely. The Nest Hub Max is getting Zoom after &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rave-zoom-on-facebook-portal/"&gt;Facebook added the service to its Portal devices&lt;/a&gt; back in September, but before Amazon rolls it out to its Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHthep"&gt;This kind of smart display is popular with people who want the functionality of a smart speaker, but want to do more than the audio-only devices allow — and that includes video calls. Facebook offers their range of Portal devices with four sizes to choose from (ranging from 8 inches to literally your TV), but you’ll have to contend with their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18072998/facebook-portal-plus-smart-display-messenger-review-price-specs"&gt;not so privacy-friendly reputation&lt;/a&gt;. The Nest Hub Max, at $229, is pricier, but just plain does more, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;which is reflected in our review score&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnAaD2"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;also reviews well&lt;/a&gt; for its good display, sound, and Alexa support, but doesn’t yet have support for Zoom, and it’s not clear when that’ll be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two people showing off a gingerbread house using their Google Nest Hub Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cHVSPu3kofPeHmNys6utpZ1jVkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22163969/holiday_blog_image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even Google knows that these devices are best for flexing your culinary creations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0XSXk"&gt;If you choose to pick up the Google device, or if you already have one, you can try out the Zoom feature by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9905737"&gt;linking your Zoom and Google accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Once you do, you can control the feature with your voice, using commands like “Hey Google, join my next meeting” or “Hey Google, start a Zoom call.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGToGR"&gt;The hands-free commands will be useful, since these devices are popular in the kitchen, so you won’t have to get dough on the display to flex your awesome Christmas cookies thanks to a year of pandemic baking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="As03P6"&gt;Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, who among them effectively control the entirety of the console gaming market, have announced a shared set of safety guidelines for how they’ll moderate and police their online platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhTInj"&gt;“Protecting players online requires a multidisciplinary approach,” the statement, which was posted &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/14/shared-safety-principles/"&gt;simultaneously&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/online-safety-principles/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/shared-online-safety-principles/"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt;, reads. “One that combines the benefits of advanced technology, a supportive community, and skilled human oversight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNyhFU"&gt;The principles have been published as increasing numbers of games, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261532/fortnite-patch-xbox-one-ps4-cross-play-default-battle-royale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496885/apex-legends-cross-play-beta-launch-ps4-xbox-pc-compete"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496885/apex-legends-cross-play-beta-launch-ps4-xbox-pc-compete"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are offering crossplay among the different platforms, allowing gamers to play together regardless of which hardware they’re using. However, the feature could cause problems if each platform’s rules are enforced differently. The new principles should help each console manufacturer follow similar approaches to keeping players safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vRSCy4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This partnership signifies our commitment to work together”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ48o0"&gt;In the past, Sony has cited potential differences like these as the reason for not allowing PS4 gamers to play against other consoles. Back in 2017, PlayStation global sales and marketing head Jim Ryan &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-13-sony-defends-decision-to-block-cross-play-with-xbox-one-and-nintendo-switch"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the reason the company wasn’t supporting crossplay in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was that the company didn’t want to expose its players to online environments outside of its control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GT0DA"&gt;“We have a contract with the people who go online with us, that we look after them and they are within the PlayStation curated universe,” Ryan said. “Exposing what in many cases are children to external influences we have no ability to manage or look after, it’s something we have to think about very carefully.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ01KC"&gt;Sony later walked back its position, and allowed for crossplay between consoles in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182389/rocket-league-cross-play-enabled-ps4-switch-xbox-pc"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182389/rocket-league-cross-play-enabled-ps4-switch-xbox-pc"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;. It has allowed other games on its platform to support the feature since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwNPtF"&gt;The new principles come under three main categories; prevention, partnership, and responsibility. Prevention covers allowing players to customize their privacy controls, to promote the existence of these options and make them easy to use. Partnership, meanwhile, includes pledges to cooperate with other organizations and ratings agencies on safety initiatives. Finally, responsibility includes a commitment to be transparent about rules, and to make it easy for players to report when people break the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHaV2m"&gt;“This partnership signifies our commitment to work together to improve player safety and ensure gaming remains truly for everyone,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XgrB2"&gt;The announcement doesn’t contain any details about specific policy changes any of the companies are making, but the solidarity is notable in an industry where competition among them is often characterized as a “war.”&lt;/p&gt;
