    <title>The pandemic might cut down e-waste but widen the digital divide </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6OHec8"&gt;We now have evidence that staying home to game or stream and chill during the pandemic was pretty much a first-world problem (or privilege, depending on how you look at it). The proof is in a &lt;a href="https://www.unbonn.org/node/13588"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published today by the United Nations University and UN Institute for Training and Research that looks at where drops in electronics sales and associated e-waste took place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4QDkdn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;4.9 million fewer metric tons of e-waste&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OZn30A"&gt;The report looked at electronics consumption in the first few quarters of 2020, and then used that to estimate future e-waste. It projects that worldwide, we’ll have discovered that 4.9 million fewer metric tons of e-waste were generated compared to a “business as usual” scenario without the pandemic. But that drop was uneven across the globe, the authors found. Electronics sales are estimated to have fallen 30 percent in low and middle-income countries, compared to just 5 percent in richer nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9aYBw"&gt;“The so-called digital divide is increasing,” report co-author Ruediger Kuehr said in a statement. “The ability to adapt to digitisation and earn a living or simply to own and benefit from electronics is decreasing in some parts of the world.” Countries in Northern Africa, Western Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia will be the hardest hit, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LPAf8c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;high-income countries are projected to be solely responsible for a slight uptick in game console, cell phone, laptop, and electrical ovens&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzX7GR"&gt;On the other hand, high-income countries are projected to be solely responsible for a slight global uptick in game console, cell phone, laptop, and electrical oven purchases last year. In those countries, it seems people did indeed turn to screens (and maybe baking?) to while away their time during pandemic lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKGz3H"&gt;Tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;still managed to profit&lt;/a&gt; during the hellscape of 2020. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; raked in the dough from gaming and computers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253844/samsung-earnings-q4-fy-2020-profits-covid-display-mobile"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; made more money last year than it did the year before. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;doubled its profit&lt;/a&gt; near the onset of the pandemic. And the 2020 lull in tech spending among low and middle-income countries is expected to be temporary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEYsD5"&gt;As more people buy more gadgets, e-waste piles up, and can leach harmful materials like mercury into the environment. E-waste reached a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309776/record-amount-ewaste-2019-global-report-environment-health"&gt;record high&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and just 17 percent was recycled. A lot more can still be done to prolong each gadget’s lifespan, increase recycling, and make companies responsible for collecting the products they generate so that e-waste doesn’t trash the environment, advocates say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFEGHA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok hired some of its best animators for an anti-bullying campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2v1Hc6iREZrkA1_K-aqeGBz0h6M=/0x1:1693x1130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426948/tiktikbullying.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Moments from three of the animators’ videos. From left to right: Kelly Emmrich, AmyRightMeow, Rosie.gif. | Images: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8xLv63"&gt;Starting today, you might see some beautiful new animations posted to TikTok’s accounts. The company has partnered with six of its platform’s popular animators — several of whom were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21436768/tiktok-cartoons-animators-creators-king-science-tootymcnooty-maddi-winter-alex-rabbit"&gt;featured in &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; — to make videos for a campaign against bullying. The videos were all written and created by the animators and are meant to offer their perspective on the pressures faced by creators on the platform, even ones who are blowing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Edqe9"&gt;The spots also highlight TikTok’s vibrant animation community. The platform has been a boon for animators, who have found that its short format makes it possible for them to create good and consistent output that stands apart from the pack and hooks viewers. One of the creators, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@king.science?lang=en"&gt;King Science&lt;/a&gt;, has 11.6 million followers, putting him among the platform’s most followed users. The campaign also features &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@amyrightmeow?lang=en"&gt;AmyRightMeow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@recokh?lang=en"&gt;Recokh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kellyemmrich?lang=en"&gt;Kelly Emmrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rosie.gif?lang=en"&gt;Rosie.gif&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@milkymichii?lang=en"&gt;milkymichii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZSoZER"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktoktips/video/6971557466991545606" data-video-id="6971557466991545606" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktoktips" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktoktips"&gt;@tiktoktips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friendly reminder that one positive comment can make someone’s day &lt;a title="createkindness" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/createkindness"&gt;#CreateKindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok Tips" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6971557331838438149"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok Tips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HHYElH"&gt;TikTok views the campaign as one part of its strategy to combat harassment. While teams of moderators may be the first thing that comes to mind, TikTok says another flank is the tone and expectations the company sets for its community. The company wants to make sure that users know the rules, so that if your video gets taken down it’s “not the only time you’re thinking of what community guidelines are, so it’s not like you’re in the principal’s office,” Tara Wadhwa, director of policy for TikTok US, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Z4mGu"&gt;The company has made a number of updates to its app over the past year to improve its anti-harassment measures. There’s now a pop-up that’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322814/tiktok-inappropriate-or-unkind-comments-warning-pop-up-anti-bullying"&gt;warn users&lt;/a&gt; if it detects they’re posting a mean comment, and creators now have the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444278/tiktok-bulk-harassment-reporting-feature-announced"&gt;report and block users and delete comments in bulk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4lkhH"&gt;Those measures aren’t necessarily going to protect every creator — the platform is filled with amorphous communities sharing vulnerable stories, and it can rocket someone to stardom overnight. “None of this is gonna be the silver bullet,” Wadhwa says. “It’s where do we want our community to go … and what are the range of strategies we can use to get there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YxQ08n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktoktips/video/6971580171165912325" data-video-id="6971580171165912325" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktoktips" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktoktips"&gt;@tiktoktips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before you comment, Stitch or Duet, remember that you never know what someone is going through   &lt;a title="createkindness" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/createkindness"&gt;#CreateKindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok Tips" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6971580016782101254"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok Tips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>Kabuto’s giant smart suitcase announced for Hot Vax Summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewqHBbE0-_iwxMIe2sQa04X2GUQ=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426846/Kabuto_GIF.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kabuto Trunk and optional Pocket in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Video: Kabuto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jlSX2z"&gt;Smart luggage maker Kabuto is now selling a 95L &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kabuto/kabuto-fingerprint-locked-trunk-expandable-backpack/description"&gt;Trunk with magnetically attachable Backpack&lt;/a&gt; that itself can double in capacity from 9L to 18L. The hard shell trunk includes a TSA-approved fingerprint lock, removable battery to charge your gadgets, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14613310/magnetic-latches-rule-velcro-drools"&gt;magnetic Fidlock fasteners&lt;/a&gt;, just like those found on the &lt;a href="https://mykabuto.com/products/kabuto-smart-luggage-4-wheels?variant=31771823046737"&gt;Kabuto Smart Carry-On bags&lt;/a&gt; launched on Kickstarter in 2019. Both bags should begin shipping by the end of summer as vaccine-fueled travel begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8JU7e"&gt;The $629 (early bird pricing) Kabuto Trunk measures 72 x 36 x 37cm (28 x 14 x 14.5 inches) and weighs 4.7kg / 10.4lb. It can be configured with a $29 30W 10,000mAh battery for smartphones or a beefier $79, 60W, 20,000mAh battery that can also charge most USB-C laptops. The batteries can be stored in an optional $69 Pocket that magnetically attaches to the front of the Trunk and charges devices stored inside or out thanks to an external charging hub. That means you can sit down, wheel the trunk in front of you, plug in your laptop, and place it on the boxy Trunk for a mobile workspace on the go. When you check the Trunk, just pop off the Pocket to keep all your valuables (and battery) with you on the plane. The Trunk is available in black / copper or blue / silver color combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehJ6bb"&gt;The fingerprint sensor can store up to 10 fingerprints, making it suitable for sharing with family or friends. Like the Carry-On, the Trunk’s fingerprint sensor has its own dedicated replaceable battery that will warn you when the charge is getting low. Nevertheless, you’ll also get a set of slim back-up keys that can be carried in a wallet or purse. Kabuto claims the sensor is fast. I tested the sensor on the 2019 Kabuto Carry-On and that’s already very fast — equivalent to what you’d expect unlocking a modern smartphone. Assigning fingerprints is also quick, although you’ll likely need to relearn the steps should you ever share the bag as it’s not entirely intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qpPSIF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-Vy_Fn39ng?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vscjSx"&gt;The $299 (early bird pricing) Kabuto Backpack includes a USB-C hub on the side. It doubles in capacity using hidden magnets that incrementally expand the sides of the bag as pressure builds. And like the Pocket, it snaps onto the Kabuto Trunk using a magnetic Fidlock mechanism that Kabuto says can securely hold up to 10kg / 22lb. The Trunk remains upright with the help of four “tires” that Kabuto claims are “the most silent wheels ever.” The Backpack is available in silver, blue, grey, and a nude beige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgMWhM"&gt;The Trunk / Backpack combo is available for $929 via early bird pricing. Kabuto bags are covered by a lifetime warranty and are expected to begin shipping in September at the tail end of Hot Vax Summer, just as the world &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; emerges from our collective traveling funk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Mc5W4E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google will stop charging search providers for chance to be Android default in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hmf_uk4O-EKkA4wdpaMhmT2DVq0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426645/google_search_choice_screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen will now show up to 12 providers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLfT93"&gt;Google is changing how its Android search engine choice screen works in Europe, following complaints from rivals about its pay-to-play model, the company has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/changes-android-choice-screen-europe/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The selection screen appears for users when they first set up an Android device, and is designed to offer a choice of search engines after Google was hit by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;record $5 billion antitrust fine&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. From September, the search giant is making it free for search engines to be included, and is increasing the number of services that’ll be shown on the selection screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PdNnl"&gt;Currently, the selection screen includes a choice of just four search providers. One is Google, and the other three are chosen through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751353/google-auction-android-search-choice-screen"&gt;sealed-bid auction process&lt;/a&gt;. Search providers each “state the price that they are willing to pay each time a user selects them from the choice screen” and Google then selects the three highest bidders over a minimum bid threshold, and displays them in a random order on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NYGWD9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Up to 12 search providers will now be shown&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSi4fd"&gt;After the changes, which will apply to all devices sold in the European Economic Area and the UK, Google will display up to 12 providers on its search selection screen, and none will have to pay to be included. The first five will be the most popular search engines in a given country, as determined by the web analytics service StatCounter, displayed in a random order. Below these, Google will show up to seven more providers in a random order. If there are ever more than seven other providers to choose from, then Google says it’ll randomly display a selection of seven whenever the choice screen in shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NB8jt"&gt;Although providers won’t have to pay to be included, Google has detailed a number of eligibility requirements &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Providers must offer a “general search service,” which means results can’t be limited to a single topic, they need to offer a free app on Google Play, and they need to be correctly localized in a country to be visible on its selection screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vz5uNJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google is now doing what it should have done 3yr ago: a free search preference menu on Android in the EU: &lt;a href="https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr"&gt;https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it should be on all platforms (e.g., also desktop Chrome), accessible at all times (i.e., not just on factory reset), and in all countries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3"&gt;https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gabriel Weinberg (@yegg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1402258047737774082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lhU4UF"&gt;Responding to the news, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg cautiously welcomed the changes, but criticized Google for not having made them three years ago. He said they should also apply to more devices and in all countries, and that the selection screen should not be limited to the first time a user sets up or factory resets an Android device. In &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/#:~:text=When%20will%20a,again%20during%20setup"&gt;its FAQ&lt;/a&gt; Google confirmed that users will only see the choice screen once per device, during setup. Last year, Weinberg criticized the auction process, and called it “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494316/microsoft-bing-android-google-search-alternative-option-download"&gt;fundamentally flawed.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x65PMa"&gt;But in comments &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/google-bows-to-eu-rivals-with-android-choice-screen-tweaks?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, EU officials welcomed the “positive” move that addressed complaints from rivals. “Users will have even more opportunities to choose an alternative,” the European Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHisVp"&gt;HBO Max has updated its Apple TV app as it attempts to fix the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525177/hbo-max-apple-tv-broken-button-controls"&gt;myriad issues&lt;/a&gt; that have been plaguing the software since last week. The update &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;fixes significant problems&lt;/a&gt; with basic features like fast-forwarding and rewinding, which had been introduced after the software switched away from using the native tvOS video player. The software update brings the native player back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boCiIG"&gt;“We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come,” HBO Max &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEKmLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come. Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here. Thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— HBOMaxHelp (@HBOMaxHelp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uA2VlS"&gt;Although the worst of the issues appear to have been fixed, users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;HBOMax subreddit&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that some bugs remain after the new update. One user reports that they’re finding their subtitles keep &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/h14cg1l?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reverting back to Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Thankfully, as another user has pointed out, the new update makes it easier to switch subtitles back, a process which the previous update had made &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly#:~:text=turning%20on%2Foff%20subtitles%20requires%20pressing%20pause%2C%20swiping%20down%20then%20across%20to%20subtitles%2C%20pressing%20again%20then%20scrolling%20to%20your%20desired%20option%2C%20pressing%20yet%20again%20then%20resuming%20playback.%20before%2C%20you%20could%20swipe%20down%2C%20select%20your%20choice%2C%20then%20swipe%20up%20again%20-%20the%20standard%20tvos%20way."&gt;significantly more difficult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXzQuQ"&gt;Questions remain about how such broken software was able to be released to users in the first place. Responding to a tweet from &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; editor in chief Nilay Panel, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager Andy Forssell admitted that this was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;” and that the company would be investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-06-09T03:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <title>The Vivaldi browser now has mail, calendar, and an RSS reader built-in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0uXbObYQ-mAQ4f5O2fntzJMU5-c=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426491/4_0_hero_image_980x551.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USJQOa"&gt;Vivaldi users will now be able to check their email, calendar, and RSS feeds all through the browser’s built-in tools: &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-4-0/"&gt;the 4.0 release is launching today&lt;/a&gt;, and includes the Vivaldi Mail beta, which promises a more private alternative to web apps made by “Big Tech” companies. Even putting any potential privacy gains aside, Vivaldi is offering something that power users may want: an all-in-one app for browsing, emailing, and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mjoyu"&gt;The email client supports IMAP and POP accounts, so you can connect the vast majority of email services to it, and you can easily have messages open up in tabs rather than taking over the current window — handy if you’re the type who often needs to bounce between emails. The search is also, in my experience, very quick. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nlpaOCZzYms1zIZtmWeD5X5okSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646324/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having your email available as a sidebar can be handy for quickly checking if you have unread messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fDnb0k"&gt;The calendar and RSS reader also include most of the features I’d expect, along with a few really cool bonuses. For example, the RSS reader also supports YouTube channels, which could be handy for those who are worried about an algorithm deciding not to show a creator’s videos. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Csx-WLvJjvNgUIb4bR_p3Zar5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646383/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_4.21.47_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can mix RSS feeds, YouTube videos, and even podcasts if you want. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jJNT6d"&gt;The other headline feature of this Vivaldi update is built-in translation. The browser will be able to translate entire webpages (automatically, if you want) in 50 languages as of today, but the company says it’ll be expanding to support 109 languages soon. While the Mail tools are desktop only, the translation is also available on Vivaldi for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVVjxP"&gt;Vivaldi has also come up with a solution for those who don’t want these features taking up room in their browser: you’ll be able to choose between three layouts, which will give you a basic web browser, one with a few power-user features, or the all-in-one experience with email, calendars, and RSS. All the features will still be available, even in the “Essentials” layout, but they won’t be taking up space in the interface. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UhG_ZVp4hsRSzUx4LuVROTafK_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646305/how_much_vivaldi_browser.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The layout options can keep you from getting overwhelmed if you don’t want all the extra features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U1RV4q"&gt;It could be argued that, since many people manage their email and calendars on websites, that most browsers have this functionality built-in. But for those (like myself) whose emails and calendars are spread across multiple accounts, dedicated tools are way less fussy to deal with. Vivaldi is now offering the power that comes with dedicated tools, with the convenience of not having to leave your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus to launch stripped-down Nord CE 5G this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWp7rWH46bNOfBLD1RWCi9PNoko=/0x0:864x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426437/nce5g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G. | OnePlus via TechRadar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUkr43"&gt;OnePlus is planning to announce a new budget smartphone called the Nord CE 5G this week. &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; has a render of the device &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/exclusive-oneplus-nord-ce-design-first-look-and-how-oneplus-designed-it"&gt;straight from OnePlus itself&lt;/a&gt;, showing that, well, it looks quite a lot like the original OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkjv80"&gt;The CE 5G, however, will be a little cut back in terms of specs. OnePlus’ product head Oliver Zhang tells &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; that CE stands for “Core Edition” and refers to a design philosophy where the company had a goal of “distilling the product down to the most important things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUiITm"&gt;“You see mid-range phones on the market with very exaggerated specifications,” Zhang says. “We actively avoided some of those features and kept the things we felt would really make a difference to the daily smartphone experience, like fast charging (Warp Charge 30T Plus), a 90Hz AMOLED display, or 5G.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q16nzR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord review: the right compromises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UMUIiF"&gt;OnePlus itself has been guilty of these “exaggerated specifications” in the past — the original Nord, for example, had a “quad-camera” setup that included a 2-megapixel macro camera and depth sensor of dubious utility. The Nord CE 5G, on the other hand, makes do with three cameras on the back. That camera proposition, as well as the CE 5G’s processor and price, will be key to the product’s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch34QH"&gt;Evleaks has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; several leaked images and a video of the Nord CE 5G, revealing some more features like a 64-megapixel main camera, 7.9mm thickness, and — unlike the original Nord — a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yluuKP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;OnePlus Nord Core Edition 5G &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ovnqoXxKL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9ovnqoXxKL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgGeMi"&gt;The full reveal is happening tomorrow, June 10th, at 10PM ET. The Nord CE 5G is being targeted at the European and Indian markets, according to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s first folding Pixel is apparently still on track for a 2021 reveal</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Z Fold 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nxU1r"&gt;Google may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22448165/google-samsung-wearable-partnership-wear-os-tizen-merge-smartwatch"&gt;shied away from a Pixel Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but a Pixel Fold still very much seems to be on the way — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;a leak last August&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the company was planning to release its first folding Pixel phone in late 2021, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will begin production of folding OLED panels this October for Google, Vivo and Xiaomi’s upcoming folding phones, all of which will reportedly be revealed late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAfTpk"&gt;Google hasn’t exactly kept its folding phone ambitions a secret; in 2019, it published patent applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;for its own folding screens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;admitted it had been prototyping them for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, telling &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t have “a clear use case yet.” But now, it appears Google has a foldable, codename “Passport,” that could be nearly ready to announce. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/android-12-beta-model-numbers-pixel-6-family-passport-foldable/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; even spotted a new reference&lt;/a&gt; to it last month in Android 12’s code, alongside other codenames believed to be the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 5a 5G. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; says it’ll have a single 7.6-inch panel that folds inward, while Vivo’s upcoming phone will have a 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch outer display. It didn’t mention the size of the new Xiaomi phone’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uSRFA"&gt;It’s not clear whether a Pixel Fold would actually come with a display designed by Google itself, though it’s possible; Samsung acts as a contract manufacturer for many other companies, producing some of Apple’s homegrown processors as one example. Either way, one portion of the screen’s sandwich may still largely belong to Samsung itself: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will supply its proprietary ultra-thin cover glass (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;which is technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) to other smartphone manufacturers, and Google is expected to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DNbiiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Folding glass: how, why, and the truth of Samsung’s Z Flip","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2vekEL"&gt;Xiaomi already announced a folding phone earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;the Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like it’ll have a second one. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; also reports Oppo will be delaying a new foldable phone to 2022, with a 7.1-inch main screen and a smaller outer one between 1.5 and 2 inches diagonally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max has been busted for days </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IMhD-qZm5Fgljs7YY1kaw_O9nPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425659/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0tRNJ"&gt;If you’ve attempted to stream something on HBO Max from an Apple TV sometime during the last several days, you may have noticed that its player controls are unusable. It’s not just you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqDmgf"&gt;Ongoing issues seem to be related to an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hbo-max-stream-tv-movies/id971265422"&gt;app update&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly addressed “a few bugs lurking around” on June 5th. Since that update released, users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that basic playback functionality — such as fast-forwarding, rewinding, and pausing — is borked completely when you try to use the service on an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POJuAO"&gt;How an update this riddled with bugs rolled out to consumers remains unclear. Unfortunately, it’s also unclear when exactly they’re going to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l3P1rU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There’s legitimately no way to pause, rewind or fast forward on the HBO Max app no matter if you use the apple remote or the remote mobile app. Idk how anyone is watching anything on there&lt;/p&gt;— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgIQWY"&gt;Asked for comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was working to fix the issue “as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8wi12"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s editor in chief Nilay Patel tweeted about the issue, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401771759641055244"&gt;Andy Forssell replied&lt;/a&gt; that the company was undertaking “one whale of an effort to address this with app updates as soon as humanly possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8iuUh"&gt;“You’ll hear no excuses from us,” Forssell added, “fixes coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZP1rz"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1401883622089674752"&gt;when asked&lt;/a&gt; by Patel how it was possible that the update shipped to users with broken playback controls, the HBO Max head said that was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="60k69f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@reckless&lt;/a&gt; That's the zillion dollar question. First priority is to deliver for users in addressing the issues, but in parallel we will also dive deep into that question. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Forssell (@aforssell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ro2i5x"&gt;On Twitter, the HBO Max help account is replying directly to frustrated users. “We’re aware that our recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HBOMax?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; app update for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV"&gt;@AppleTV&lt;/a&gt; led to a number of issues for our viewers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402409361461460993"&gt;the account said in one tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Our team is working quickly to restore the experience you’re used to. We appreciate your patience and will provide updates as they become available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gX9MN"&gt;Separately, on Friday,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted the service about reported issues affecting the new Siri Remote’s scrubbing feature — though that issue was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519340/siri-remote-scrubbing-feature-disney-plus"&gt;not limited to just HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, a spokesperson said that it was aware of player control issues as well as “a few isolated reports” of HDR playback problems. But the spokesperson also added that the company did not believe the HDR issues were related to an update, as the most recent update at the time did not include changes to the video player itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE5Z0L"&gt;Given the problems with the app right now, if you were hoping to stream the &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; finale on your Apple TV box without issue, you may want to hold off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XsQAR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 9th, 3:52AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; HBO Max has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525635/hbo-max-apple-tv-app-update-native-tvos-player-fixed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;released an update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for its Apple TV app which users are reporting fixes many of the issues detailed above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZW5kE"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one of Apple’s many announcements this week at its Worldwide Developer Conference, which some see as a possible threat to the rise of journalism distributed by email. If that sounds self-indulgent, given that it’s coming from a journalist who distributes his work via email, I apologize. But it touches on so many of the subjects of interest to us here — a tech giant’s ability to reshape markets to its liking; how journalism will navigate the platform era; what we mean when we talk about privacy — that I hope I can pique your interest at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0lpy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wnk4BD"&gt;Start with the announcement. On Monday at WWDC, Apple announced&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn%2520the%2520Mail%2520app%252C%2520Mail%2Cused%2520to%2520determine%2520their%2520location.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22525195%2Fapple-mail-protection-privacy-pixel-tracking-newsletters-substack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Mail Privacy Protection&lt;/a&gt;, which will limit the amount of data that people who send you emails can collect about you. Here’s how the company describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aGxsdc"&gt;In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6x6I6C"&gt;When you eventually update your iPhone to iOS 15 this fall, you’ll see a screen at launch that invites you to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="mUonCX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;iOS 15: First launch of Mail app. &lt;a href="https://t.co/W4ewu9XFCk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/W4ewu9XFCk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1401993816001978375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="04KYBc"&gt;Let’s assume most Apple Mail users opt in. How necessary is this data to building email-based businesses? Over the past day I’ve read and heard lots of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56SUVK"&gt;Some quick background for the non-email obsessives. Long ago, email marketers began including invisible pixels in the emails they send you; when you open their messages, those pixels load, telling the sender that you read their message, and might also infer your location from your IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfGydg"&gt;Collectively, the percentage of people that actually open emails is known as the open rate, and it’s one of the most important metrics that senders measure to gauge the effectiveness of what they’re doing. It gives you a sense of how engaged your audience is, and how that engagement is changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYikKE"&gt;At the same time, there is a fairly long tradition of people finding this creepy. The email startup Superhuman &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/superhuman-founder-apology-email-tracking-spyware-backlash-2019-7"&gt;had to apologize in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after a viral blog post explained how the company tracked when, where, and how often people opened emails sent through its service. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, a nonprofit newsroom that often focuses on issues of data privacy, turned down eight potential email providers &lt;a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/themarkup/issues/hello-from-the-markup-199187"&gt;before finding one that would agree to turn off tracking capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFJtaC"&gt;Last year, when Basecamp launched the email service Hey, it made the blocking of tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"&gt;a marquee feature&lt;/a&gt;. In a blog post today, Basecamp cofounder David Heinemeier Hansson — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;no fan of Apple in general&lt;/a&gt;! — declared victory against tracking pixels. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OfxG3V"&gt;Given Apple’s monopoly advantage with their preinstalled Mail app, we don’t need much of an uptake from what they’re calling Mail Privacy Protection to break the dam on spy pixels. You can’t really say anything authoritatively about open rates if 5-10-30-50% of your recipients are protected against snooping, as you won’t know whether that’s why your spy pixel isn’t tripping, or it’s because they’re just not opening your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfvbxc"&gt;There’s also simply no way users are going to willingly accept the premise of spy pixels if Apple presents the privacy dangers as clearly and as honestly as we’ve done in HEY. Apple already showed that with their drive to block unique ad identifiers for cross-app tracking in iOS 14.5: &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/targeted-ads-are-staggeringly-unpopular-so-we-should-ban-them-01c13a9c"&gt;96% of users in the US have declined to let apps track them like that!&lt;/a&gt; And email spy pixels are far worse and much creepier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8DWPeA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rZR9KN"&gt;Let’s stipulate a few things up front. One, most people still don’t know that these spy pixels exist. Two, if they did, most people probably wouldn’t allow them if given the choice. Three, the majority of these spy pixels are used for marketing purposes — efforts to target you better for e-commerce. I do not think it is at all irrational to look at the state of affairs the way Apple did, and say to hell with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x66xXB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAJgjU"&gt;At the same time, email-based publishing has been of the few bright spots for journalism in recent years. (Certainly it has been a bright spot for me!) Media companies from Facebook to Twitter to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; are now investing heavily in newsletter strategies; new email-based publishers are &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/40-north-tpg-digital-media-startup-funding-69eacb52-1ff8-42ba-8742-32b36d762d3c.html"&gt;popping up seemingly every week&lt;/a&gt;. Much of this has come in the wake of the success of Substack, which I use to publish Platformer (&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/platformer/Ethics-Policy-e8ee22c0ce7b4228b5da482a83b2ab76"&gt;see disclosure&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3vav"&gt;And so it’s no surprise that some observers look at Mail Privacy Protection and see a threat. “This is another sign that Apple’s war against targeted advertising isn’t just about screwing Facebook,” Joshua Benton &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/a-packed-set-of-apple-announcements-could-have-big-impacts-on-news-publishers-for-good-and-for-ill/"&gt;wrote in Nieman Lab&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re also coming for your Substack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUTtW8"&gt;Benton brings some powerful numbers to buttress his worries: “The &lt;a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/email-client-market-share-may-2021/"&gt;most recent market-share numbers from Litmus&lt;/a&gt;, for May 2021, &lt;em&gt;93.5%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens on phones come in Apple Mail on iPhones or iPads,” he writes. “On desktop, Apple Mail on Mac is responsible for &lt;em&gt;58.4%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5xrPG"&gt;It seems clear that Apple’s move to cut off granular customer data from email senders will affect the email economy. But after conversations with newsletter writers and media executives today, I’m not sure that people doing email-based journalism have all that much to worry about from the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJYHGc"&gt;“The advertising industry has addicted itself to tracking, prioritizing bottom of the funnel metrics at the expense of great content and creative. It’s tragic,” said Alex Kantrowitz, author of the free, ad-supported newsletter &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (He previously covered the industry for &lt;em&gt;Ad Age&lt;/em&gt;.) “And it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BORsUb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yu5mu5"&gt;Kantrowitz told me that his ad inventory was sold out for the first half of the year, thanks to a premium audience he identified not by pixel-based tracking but by a good old-fashioned reader survey. (&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, too, has used reader surveys to build a picture of its user base.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTGZAX"&gt;“Pixel blocking makes placements like this more valuable and gives quality email newsletters a leg up on the junk clogging most people’s inboxes,” Kantrowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPBUQp"&gt;For ad-based newsletters, then, Mail Privacy Protection is likely to spur publishers to find other ways to understand their audiences. But what about paid newsletters, like the one this column is syndicated from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9vz8d"&gt;Apple’s move may affect reader-supported newsletters even less, publishing industry executives told me today. Writers can triangulate reader engagement by plenty of metrics that are still available to them, including the views their stories get on the web, the overall growth of their mailing list, and — most meaningful of all — the growth of their revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OiZpQ"&gt;The media business changes so quickly that I don’t find it at all irrational to read about a move like the one Apple made this week and assume it will be bad for journalism. But in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm. There are any number of changes that major email providers including Apple, Google, and Microsoft could make that would make life more difficult for newsletter-based businesses. In the end, though, I don’t think blocking spy pixels is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xce2am"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="99mWAK"&gt;All that said, I can’t end without pointing out the ways in which Apple itself benefits from cracking down on email data collection. The first one is obvious: it further burnishes the company’s privacy credentials, part of an ongoing and incredibly successful public-relations campaign to build user trust during a time of collapsing faith in institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o30tbg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp1Ndb"&gt;Taken together, the numerous iOS 15 features focused on user privacy combine to place more pressure on the digital ad ecosystem. Perhaps most notably, “Private Relay” — available to paying subscribers of Apple’s iCloud+ service — will encrypt all traffic leaving a user’s device, making them harder for advertisers to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8ePgs"&gt;One of my more cynical friends views all this as a way to funnel more businesses to building apps, offering in-app purchases, and promoting them with Apple’s advertising products. Marketing emails not working as well as they used to? Sounds like it’s time to buy some keywords in the App Store!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCet5h"&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model? Apple will be there, ready and waiting to take a 30 percent cut of Twitter Super Follows, paid podcasts, and ticketed Facebook events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xdt6y"&gt;It’s sometimes said that Amazon’s ultimate goal is to take a cut of all economic activity. Looking at Apple’s privacy moves this week, I’m mostly willing to take them at face value — as a necessary counter-balance to the inexorable rise of tracking technologies around the web. But it also seems clear that the value to Apple goes far beyond customer satisfaction — and as its revenues from ads and in-app purchases grow, we’d do well to keep an eye on how its policies are gradually reshaping the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Q0E8Sa"&gt;
&lt;p id="pEjYP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
