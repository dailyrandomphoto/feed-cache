    <title>Verizon support says you should turn off 5G to save your phone’s battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Verizon Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone with the 5G inscription background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYLHsvbhArPFRlGPayxGnme_6xc=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68887873/1227822210.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwJAmv"&gt;Despite its relentless promotion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22194419/5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide"&gt;5G phones&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that it spent more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;$45 billion bidding&lt;/a&gt; on a new faster spectrum, Verizon support now is advising people on Twitter to turn off their phones’ 5G access to preserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1vDDR"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VZWSupport/status/1366055566347546635?s=20"&gt;Sunday morning tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon support helpfully suggested that “one way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE” if users found their batteries were “draining faster than normal.” That step would, of course, turn off 5G in a phone that has it available. It’s also worth pointing out that you don’t actually “turn on LTE” when doing this step — LTE is always enabled as a fallback for the 5G network. But Verizon is obviously being cautious so as not to actually tell its customers to “turn off 5G”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAfQh69dqwsWSeWwmy_E0WegA_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22334862/verizon_says_turn_off_5g.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GIze4C"&gt;Twitter users naturally pointed out that switching to LTE-only would mean turning off 5G (which is available in some newer phones), but the helpful support person said it was important to troubleshoot “steps to find the root cause of any issues with speed,” adding that Verizon is “quickly launching more 5G areas, and making updates constantly to improve speeds.” Verizon’s nationwide 5G network uses a technology called DSS, which in many instances is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;actually slower than the LTE network&lt;/a&gt; it’s trying to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon announced its big 5G plans for 2021 last month, after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October 2020&lt;/a&gt;.  One of its top priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage, which is currently restricted to parts of some cities in the US. It’s also heavily dependent on how close you are to a Verizon 5G site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jauZ6Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oxXD2Q"&gt;Both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T spent big bucks in the FCC’s Auction 107, bidding on the C-band spectrum. Verizon spent $45.4 billion— twice as much as AT&amp;amp;T’s $23.4 billion. AT&amp;amp;T’s current nationwide 5G network also relies on DSS with speeds close to or lower than 4G LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ottI2"&gt;The new frequencies won’t become available until the end of the 2021 at the earliest, and will be available in limited locations first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMmHq3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s shiny red Galaxy Chromebook 2 is now available at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eX4Owb7wkhtBqCERNzOt03iUIrU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68887390/bfarsace190331_4355_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OO3OOg"&gt;Samsung’s latest Chrome OS laptop, the Galaxy Chromebook 2, is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733322550682053658" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available for purchase at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The Chromebook 2 was first announced at CES in January and features a new QLED display, 360-degree hinge, and a striking red paint job. It starts at $549.99 for a Celeron model and goes up to $699.99 for a Core i3 version, putting it at the higher end of Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfKjrF"&gt;That price is the most significant thing about the Chromebook 2 because it’s considerably less than the Galaxy Chromebook that debuted a year ago. The older Chromebook had an 4K OLED screen and came with a stylus — neither of which you’ll fine with the new model — but it also cost just under $1,000 when it came out. In our review, we found despite the gorgeous screen and striking paint job, the original Galaxy Chromebook didn’t justify its cost, particularly thanks to abysmal battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ld3ze5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10366068"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46EIGp"&gt;We’ve yet to put the new Chromebook 2 through its paces, but we did get to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;see the machine in person&lt;/a&gt; back in January and it certainly seems like it will be competent. The QLED screen isn’t quite up to the marks of the OLED panel, but you’d be hard-pressed to notice without putting them side-by-side, and the rest of the Chromebook 2’s fit and finish are appropriate for the price Samsung is asking. Importantly, it still comes in that amazing red color, as well. You might notice the extra weight — the Chromebook 2 is about half a pound heavier — but it still falls under three pounds total and should be easily portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yom0rz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 hands-on: promisingly boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9ZFMuA"&gt;We will have a full review of the Chromebook 2 in the near future, but if you don’t want to wait and grab one yourself, you might be able to find one in stock at your local Best Buy right now. Let’s just hope Samsung improved the battery life over last time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disinformation experts aren’t happy about the trailer for HBO’s QAnon series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supporters of former President Donald Trump flew a US flag with a QAnon symbol outside the Capitol on January 6th." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9ovpbX3cv_4YKMvs-dwDU-i3yU=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68887356/1294904312.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JFJCzT"&gt;The teaser video for Q: &lt;em&gt;Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming documentary series from HBO about the QAnon conspiracy movement has a lot of deplatforming experts concerned; it looks more like a preview for a spy thriller than a careful examination of the umbrella group of conspiracy theories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="11uYj7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2ftSMchz40?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sA756Y"&gt;The breathless tone might be effective at building hype, but it has many disinformation experts concerned. Ben Collins, one of the leading journalists covering online radicalization, tweeted that the trailer was “being marketed in a way that could recruit more people.” Promoted by HBO as a series that “charts a labyrinthine journey to unmask the mastermind behind QAnon,” critics pointed out that the trailer felt a lot like “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soundmigration/status/1365393034351943680"&gt;a recruitment video for Q.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aY5EdJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;disinfo community: *soberly* how do we balance coverage and inadvertent amplification of QAnon? How do we bring people back to reality in a smart, empathetic way? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HBO: *BRAAAAM (inception sounds)* watch our $30m documentary on how QAnon is HARDCORE and FUCKING CRAZY!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/HXfoDPPzjr"&gt;https://t.co/HXfoDPPzjr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emerson T. Brooking (@etbrooking) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/etbrooking/status/1365398029122080770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2CFm3E"&gt;Joan Donovan, research director at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that, by portraying Q as edgy and exciting, the trailer risked attracting even more people to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLFI7i"&gt;“The most concerning aspect to me is that the reuse of footage found online pieced together in 6 hours of conspiracist content will be validation for the contemporary movement and drive more content/interest,” Donovan said in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not like we are 5 years from the insurrection. Q influencers will use the fact of their participation in the documentary to sap more people for donations and build a more loyal audience at a time when many are struggling to contain this anti-Semitic and racist networked conspiracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM7D9v"&gt;It’s hard to say how much of those concerns will carry over to the documentary itself. The trailer is less than a minute long, and the docuseries was the result of a three-year global investigation, according to HBO. So it’s possible the series strikes the right tone in how it presents QAnon and its origins, as well as its future. &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/hbos-q-storm-six-part-documentary-series-exploring-origins-qanon-debuts-march-21"&gt;The press release announcing&lt;/a&gt; the series says it will “examine the influence of QAnon on American culture and question the consequences of unfettered free speech permeating the darkest corners of the Internet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhk3DS"&gt;Donovan said she hoped the trailer was a hoax, and that the actual film will show people speaking about how believing in QAnon ruined their relationships with their families and friends, but she wasn’t optimistic. “Somehow I doubt that will be the case,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFth4k"&gt;QAnon began on 4chan in 2017, when an anonymous person posting as “Q Clearance Patriot” said they had access to classified information showing then-President Donald Trump was fighting a global cabal of pedophiles, whose ranks included celebrities and Democratic politicians. QAnon’s followers also strongly ascribed to the view —falsely pushed by Trump— that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, and many Q proponents have been linked to the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LsJrX"&gt;Journalists have struggled with how to best cover QAnon; reporting on it without being adequately up to speed, news outlets ran the risk of amplifying and legitimizing some of the group’s more dangerous views. At the same time, ignoring QAnon’s followers or dismissing them as fringe could allow it to metastasize. One of HBO’s promotions for &lt;em&gt;Q: Into the Storm&lt;/em&gt; promised that the series will “pull back the curtain” on the group, but without the right context, could further muddy the public’s understanding of QAnon and its reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4NNPG"&gt;During its heyday, there were thousands of Q-related Facebook groups and Q-related accounts on Twitter and Reddit. Most platforms have banned, or tried to ban, Q-related content and hashtags, but with mixed success.  “QAnon depends on centuries-old anti-Jewish tropes and anti-Black narratives about the modern civil rights movement,” Donovan says. “But it’s not that complicated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUFhHy"&gt;HBO declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK5qo4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qry8bW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA authorizes one-dose COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson logo is seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ugASOKRvzskno9r_I235MW3mqEA=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68885973/1230992810.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fsMnHh"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-third-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;has authorized&lt;/a&gt; the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which only needs one dose and can be stored in regular refrigerators. It’s the third COVID-19 vaccine to get sign-off from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zatfYB"&gt;The vaccine can be administered to people 18 years and older. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298855/covid-vaccine-johnson-effective-fda-south-africa-variant"&gt;protects against serious disease&lt;/a&gt;, and clinical trials did not flag any dangerous safety problems. In the United States, it was 72 percent effective against severe and milder COVID-19. It was slightly less effective in South Africa, where a variant form of the coronavirus is widespread. Early data also suggested that the shot might prevent asymptomatic infections, but researchers need more data before they can say that for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CZgDDN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KObJb"&gt;The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is logistically easier to distribute than the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines, which take two doses and have to be stored in specialized freezers. Because it only takes one shot and doesn’t need to be frozen, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine would be easier to distribute to areas without that type of equipment. People also don’t have to come back for a second appointment. New York City officials hope to use this vaccine for &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasio-hopes-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-will-supercharge-campaign-to-reach-more-seniors"&gt;homebound seniors&lt;/a&gt; because it can more be easily brought door to door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f74O2S"&gt;The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine was built using a different technology than the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines. Those two are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562309/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-gene-based"&gt;gene-based vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, a strategy that directly delivers the genetic material for a bit of the coronavirus into the body. The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, on the other hand, inserts a section of the coronavirus’ gene into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;another harmless virus&lt;/a&gt;. That virus, called an adenovirus, delivers the coronavirus gene to cells so that the body can learn to recognize it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2BJVk"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-021-00409-0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F27%2F22301558%2Fcovid-vaccine-one-dose-johnson-fda-approval" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard to directly compare COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; because no clinical trials have studied them head-to-head. The Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines have higher efficacy on paper. Clinical trials found that they were around 95 percent protective against symptomatic COVID-19. But those vaccines were tested at different times and in different countries. The Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech trials were tested in the US and other countries before variants appeared. The trials also use different definitions for what counts as mild, moderate, or severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd1kYl"&gt;By one important measure, the vaccines are all pretty comparable: the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine was just as good as the other two at protecting people from being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J10UQT"&gt;“What you care about is hospitalizations and deaths,” said Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/02/22/970235986/why-the-johnson-johnson-vaccine-has-gotten-a-bad-rap-and-why-thats-not-fair"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “And Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson appears to be just as good as Moderna and Pfizer at preventing those.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37WCiT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-short-doses/"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has around 4 million doses, enough for 4 million people, ready to ship in the US. That’s fewer than expected; the company originally said it could have 12 million ready by the end of February. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/health/covid-vaccine-johnson-johnson.html"&gt;Manufacturing delays&lt;/a&gt; undercut that plan. The company says it will still be able to provide 20 million doses to the US by the end of March and 100 million by the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFKabS"&gt;Over 48 million people in the United States have already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDbDkB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="nb0i3t"&gt;Microsoft is finalizing its Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows PCs, which includes access to streaming games from the company’s xCloud service. We’ve managed to get access to the latest version of the Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows, an unannounced and unreleased app. Once released, the app will let Windows users stream games from their Xbox Series S / X consoles, and from xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebYKjL"&gt;Currently, you can’t stream games from the new Xbox consoles to Windows PCs, as this is unsupported in the existing Xbox Console Companion app. This new app will solve that, and also bring xCloud streaming to Windows PCs for the first time. We first got a look at this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;xCloud app for Windows last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it has improved a lot since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QIDTML"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;scoop: here's a look at Microsoft's unreleased xCloud app for Windows. This app lets you stream Xbox games from an Xbox Series X / S console, or from xCloud. Full details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ymyjQDmaeH"&gt;https://t.co/ymyjQDmaeH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/V3U3PXe7LO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V3U3PXe7LO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1365731532376317963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SaR93"&gt;The Xbox remote play feature, for connecting to Xbox consoles, works similarly to how the existing Console Companion does. You can remotely wake an Xbox console, sign in, and play games wherever you are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je8b5J"&gt;There is now full touch support, allowing Surface or other touchscreen devices to play Xbox games without a controller. Microsoft also appears to be readying some form of gyro support here, too. There’s an option to enable this, but it doesn’t appear to be fully functional yet. This is an internal beta application, so it’s still unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGV3gpzp0ZuGNZyINt-ERTLYGkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333440/VlCW8k5.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s unreleased Xbox Game Streaming app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IWMHkx"&gt;Microsoft also appears to be readying 1080p streams for xCloud, instead of the 720p that exists today. This would obviously improve the experience on Windows PCs, ahead of higher resolutions once Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295326/microsoft-project-xcloud-xbox-series-x-servers-hardware-2021"&gt;upgraded its xCloud servers to include Xbox Series X hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQaU3o"&gt;It’s still not clear exactly when this app will be made available more broadly. Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thurrott/status/1365308039725735936"&gt;rumored to be planning&lt;/a&gt; a “what’s new for gaming” event for next month, so it’s possible we’ll hear a lot more about the company’s xCloud plans (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;for the web and iOS&lt;/a&gt;, too) very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge approves $650 million Facebook privacy settlement over facial recognition feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLev8oIHMvhfAzsoUQnqRWiptS8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68885045/acastro_180522_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFxSiV"&gt;A federal judge on Friday &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333300/In_re_Facebook_Biometric_Information_Privacy_Litigation_final_order.pdf"&gt;gave final approval&lt;/a&gt; to a $650 million Facebook class action privacy settlement and ordered the 1.6 million members of the class in Illinois who submitted claims to be paid “as expeditiously as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsrAsC"&gt;Chicago attorney Jay Edelson sued Facebook in Cook County Circuit Court back in 2015, alleging that the platform’s use of facial recognition tagging was not allowed under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The lawsuit claimed that Facebook’s Tag Suggestions tool, which scanned faces in users’ photos and offered suggestions about who the person might be, stored biometric data without users’ consent in violation of the Illinois law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxNNey"&gt;The case became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17246222/facebook-bipa-fines-penalty-tag-suggestions-facial-recognition"&gt;a class action lawsuit in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847650/facebook-facial-recognition-setting-default-opt-in"&gt;made facial recognition on the platform opt-in only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcCjtS"&gt;The three named plaintiffs in the suit will each receive $5,000 and others in the class will get at least $345 each, according to the order by Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California. Donato said the settlement was a “landmark result” and a “major win for consumers in the hotly contested area of digital privacy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9xWev"&gt;“We are pleased to have reached a settlement so we can move past this matter, which is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders,” Facebook &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-san-francisco-chicago-lawsuits-af6b42212e43be1b63b5c290eb5bfd85"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG2jKs"&gt;“It’s a big deal,” Edelson told &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-facebook-privacy-settlement-approval-20210227-okljqhsiargl7ijvzzfcotpyby-story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It sends a pretty clear message that in Illinois, biometric privacy rights are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you want to start reading comics? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMtSUS3F2n2sjRyHDJpjZ4qrfdk=/57x0:732x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884741/so_capmeme.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQEatj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s first season is just about to end, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591175/black-widow-theatrical-release-streaming-disney-plus-hbo-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299343/loki-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-tom-hiddleston-wandavision-black-widow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22278944/zack-snyder-justice-league-official-premiere-trailer-hbo-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202992/dc-films-multiverse-batman-wonder-woman-aquaman-hbo-max-dceu-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GCPD, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are just around the corner — and that doesn’t account for other series outside of the main Marvel and DC Universes like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301774/hulu-modok-marvel-tv-show-trailer-robot-chicken"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MODOK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Titans, &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq42FD"&gt;There are more superhero TV series and films debuting in 2021 than seemingly ever before, and it might have some people wanting to dive into comics. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303068/wandavision-episode-8-explainer-recap-scarlet-witch-white-vision-post-credits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has led a few people on staff to dig into past Vision and Wanda Maximoff-centered storylines, for example. I’ve started reading Kieron Gillen’s &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;run leading up to Marvel Studios’ film. Whatever reason people may have for wanting to begin reading comics, there are a few different ways to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKXcgy"&gt;Comics can be a costly hobby. New issues are typically $3.99 each, and if someone is reading eight or nine different series at any one time, those fees can add up week after week. Don’t think of this guide as a recommendation for which series to dig into. If you’re looking for that, Susana Polo, the comics editor at our sister site, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/21545982/best-new-comics-of-the-week"&gt;runs a weekly rundown of books&lt;/a&gt; she’s reading and recommends. (It’s an essential part of my week, and it helps me figure out any single issues I want to pick up or start a series I might enjoy.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUNr1J"&gt;Instead, this is a guide to the different subscription methods that are available for people who want to consume a number of comics at once and do it in a cost-effective manner. These aren’t the only options, but they’re some of the easiest. There are three primary comics subscription services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jqLINY"&gt;Comixology Unlimited ($6 a month) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SXtulj"&gt;Marvel Unlimited ($10 a month or $70 a year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zj2DTj"&gt;DC Universe Infinite ($8 a month of $75 a year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2kXs3RjuQaV4q13hT9ZWRykOBjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331849/comixology.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gmLWow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comixology Unlimited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5Evojz"&gt;It’s a really, &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;good time for people to start getting into comics because of the subscription models that exist. If you’re just getting started, I recommend &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixology.com%2Funlimited&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22303444%2Fcomics-buying-guide-subscription-comixology-marvel-unlimited-dc-universe-infinite" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Comixology Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; because it has the most diverse options as well as plenty of the big mainstream stuff. (Comixology is available as an add-on through your Amazon Prime account.) There are more than 25,000 comics available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFNaBe"&gt;There are opportunities to read fantastic series from publishers like Vertigo (&lt;em&gt;Sex Criminals, Sweet Tooth, The Invisibles&lt;/em&gt;) or Image Comics (&lt;em&gt;The Fade Out, Blackbird, Fatale, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;), alongside top Marvel (Captain America, Iron Man, Immortal Hulk, Hawkeye, etc.) and DC series (Batman, Teen Titans, Wonder Woman, Justice League Dark, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beXdHp"&gt;What I love most about Comixology Unlimited is being able to explore any type of book. I will often click on a publisher, like Valiant or Dark Horse, and search through what’s offered via the Unlimited subscription. At this point, if there’s a trade paperback available (this is a term that refers to a number of single print issues, between four and 12 issues, but usually six) for someone to read. For example, if someone wanted to read Matt Fraction’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, they can do so by reading through different volumes that collect a number of single print issues. It’s the best way to find older gems that people may not have heard of before, especially if they’re new to comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9m0b3"&gt;One downside to Comixology Unlimited is the Marvel and DC Comics offerings may feel less than ideal for dedicated fans. When I was trying to read a number of back issues for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;specifically (and after I saw a Tumblr post about an old &lt;em&gt;Incredible Hulk &lt;/em&gt;arc from the ‘80s I wanted to check out), I realized I was still going to have to buy a bunch of it. While there was plenty I could read for free — all of &lt;em&gt;House of M &lt;/em&gt;is part of Unlimited, for example — to read the entire history, I was going to have to use Marvel Unlimited. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9EKvq-GYY5rJVfXU0h8iJbloInw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331850/marvel_unlimited.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9v3gHa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marvel Unlimited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c82oW6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/help/category/8"&gt;Marvel Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; has more than 27,000 digital comics for people to read. You can download up to 12 comics to carry with them at any given time, and Marvel’s team (alongside recommendation algorithms) will curate a series of books that surface when looking for something to read. It’s a great app to dig into classic tales, and some of the best runs for popular characters like Iron Man and Captain America. There’s also the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;universe for people to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CquZj2"&gt;The biggest downside affects new single issues. Currently, new issues in ongoing arcs like &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The Eternals&lt;/em&gt; get uploaded to Marvel Unlimited three months after they first come out. So roughly after the first three issues of a current run are available, they’ll start popping up in Marvel Unlimited. That’s not great news for anyone who’s trying to stay current with a number of Marvel titles. (These issues can also be purchased on Comixology for $3.99 or $3.39 with the Comixology Unlimited discount.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmHC9G"&gt;I’d say that Marvel Unlimited is best for anyone who really wants to dive deep into reading nearly every single comic Marvel has released over the years. If your goal is to get through all of the various Spider-Man comics that have been released since 1962, Marvel Unlimited is your best bet at doing it for the cheapest price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjBXjvfjzusKHLOpsYVQ-Ben5Ms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331852/dc_universe_infinite.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zLJux0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC Universe Infinite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3GG61e"&gt;The same is mostly true for &lt;a href="https://www.dcuniverseinfinite.com/"&gt;DC Universe Infinite&lt;/a&gt;. This used to be DC Universe, a service that had some comics but also a couple of TV shows (&lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn, Teen Titans&lt;/em&gt;) and some older DC movies. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;HBO Max launched&lt;/a&gt;, the TV shows and films moved over to the WarnerMedia streaming platform, and DC Universe relaunched as a comics-only platform called DC Universe Infinite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UeChU"&gt;In an effort to make DC Universe Infinite feel a little special, DC Comics did a couple of new things. The company committed to carrying back catalog titles from “Vertigo, Black Label, and Milestone comics imprints,” &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/21/22241337/dc-universe-infinite-app-new-download-problems"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be exclusive DC Comics titles that live exclusively on DC Universe Infinite. The platform currently offers more than 24,000 comics. Like Marvel Unlimited, new releases are not available right away. They’ll hit DC Universe Infinite six months after being released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSmKjn"&gt;Again, both Marvel Unlimited and DC Universe Unlimited are great for people who want to read as many past comics featuring their favorite superheroes for a cheap monthly price. They’re not great for anyone who’s looking to only read the newest stuff. Your best bet is using a digital retailer — or supporting your local comic bookshop if physical prints are more your thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aPecB"&gt;What seems wholly inevitable is that both Marvel Unlimited and DC Universe Unlimited will be offered in a bundle with &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1002380/9358?subId1=VergeTheBestWaytoReadComicBooks022621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=TheBestWayToReadComicBooks022621"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The entertainment conglomerates that own all of these properties want people to stay in their worlds — hence all the new movies and TV shows on streaming services. When that happens, it’ll be way easier for people to watch an episode of something like &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;and then dive into the character’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpbODn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine centers embrace stickers and selfie stations   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4B-8tiF1WU9DpEQdiIxME2_D_3Q=/0x86:4000x2753/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884565/1231398723.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYQH8H"&gt;The best picture I’ve seen this week was a selfie from my father-in-law who just got his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Along with the shot, they gave him a sticker that says “I got vaccinated!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gsgcb1"&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues, clinics and distribution centers across the country are embracing things like stickers and even selfie stations decked out with colorful backgrounds to help people celebrate getting the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVGseY"&gt;The selfie stations are set up as colorful backgrounds, often with pro-vaccine messaging &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Seidel_Z/status/1364369817449492482"&gt;tiled with the name of the healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt;. It’s good branding. And hey, if social media-friendly backgrounds helped make some trendy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16000552/instagram-restaurant-interior-design-photo-friendly-media-noche"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt; popular, there’s no reason they couldn’t work for vaccine sites too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n52go8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a real thing that exists at an NJ mass vaccination site. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CWWLVEBKJo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CWWLVEBKJo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NoahCRothman/status/1364946181055516673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpKvwk"&gt;Added bonus — if the vaccines are being given in a healthcare setting, it gives people a designated space to take pictures without compromising other patients’ privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8K8Nqj"&gt;Vaccine stickers and selfies can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;increase confidence in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Just like “I voted” stickers were &lt;a href="https://time.com/4541760/i-voted-sticker-history-origins/"&gt;designed to remind people&lt;/a&gt; about Election Day, “I got vaccinated” stickers are designed to help people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/15/us/covid-vaccine-stickers-trnd/index.html"&gt;see the vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt; unfolding in their own community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NKKlG"&gt;Back in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed stickers for healthcare workers to wear after they got vaccinated. Since they were some of the first people in the country to get vaccinated, the stickers were an easy way for workers to start conversations about the vaccines with their patients and colleagues — some of whom &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22214210/covid-vaccine-health-care-workers-safety-fears"&gt;might be reluctant to get the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hyIPBE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LxbZs"&gt;The ready-made vaccination celebrations are also a way to dissuade people from sharing their vaccine cards on social media. Those can contain personal information, and posting photos of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22270400/coronavirus-vaccine-card-selfie-social-media"&gt;can help scammers scam&lt;/a&gt;. A photo of your vaccinated self sporting a sticker, on the other hand, does not pose nearly as much of a privacy risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6zvFm"&gt;Stickers can serve the same purpose outside of the healthcare industry too. But also; they’re super fun. Slapping on a sticker is a chance to visually celebrate in a time when there’s been so little for us to enjoy. So is taking a selfie to share with the world. Sure, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/01/vaccine-photography/617678/"&gt;public health benefits&lt;/a&gt; to making vaccination visible. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/covid-vaccine-joy-hope/2021/02/24/62b10432-7184-11eb-85fa-e0ccb3660358_story.html"&gt;pure joy&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AnrvZ9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How do we say thank you to the health workers and scientists for their sacrifice and service? Receive the vaccine as soon as one can to lessen their load and keep wearing a mask to protect fellow citizens. In my 80th year, I am grateful and hopeful for better days ahead. &lt;a href="https://t.co/emGDlnYL2E"&gt;pic.twitter.com/emGDlnYL2E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/1352718696297484289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NYNZtC"&gt;I’m not eligible to receive the vaccine yet where I am, and I probably won’t be for a long time. But after seeing so much death and suffering during the past year, it brings me nothing but hope and happiness to see the relief in people’s eyes after they get their shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySyAvN"&gt;Other people have been taking their vaccine celebrations into their own hands. Not content with the official offerings, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/elderly-people-are-getting-dressed-up-to-have-the-vaccine-and-thats-the-energy-we-need_uk_6012a163c5b6b8719d8a1bab"&gt;dressing in their best&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashlieatkinson/status/1364289562734960641"&gt;donning sequins&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/01/vaccine-photography/617678/"&gt;bringing fun bandages&lt;/a&gt; to patch themselves up after the shot. Vaccinated people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300783/covid-vaccine-guidelines-cdc-safety-normal-life"&gt;can’t throw a big maskless party yet&lt;/a&gt; — but they can celebrate a small, momentous victory. It’s fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0DrgJ"&gt;There are still too few people vaccinated, here in the US and around the world. The rollout has been &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22213208/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-coronavirus-distribution"&gt;messy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;frustrating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287123/covid-vaccination-death-inequity-race-maps"&gt;inequitable&lt;/a&gt;. It still is. Governments can still do &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;better. But more people are getting the shot every day. In fact, Friday set vaccination records in the US and EU. &lt;/p&gt;

And all authorized vaccines do a great job at keeping people out of the hospital and alive. But the big clinical trials weren’t designed to look at how well they can keep people from passing the disease from one person to another. It’s a big question, and one that researchers (and everyone else) is eager to uncover. (Kelsey Piper / &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CjNJQD"&gt;In every volunteer opportunity I’d ever been a part of, you made camp friends, formed quick alliances. To do so that day, when you even didn’t know who had been vaccinated and who hadn’t, felt aggressive and dangerous. Even holding the door open for the person behind you on the orientation tour could violate the required distance. I couldn’t discreetly murmur to my shift buddy about who was trying to cut and who was about to get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation Network experiencing outage Saturday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PlayStation controllers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4VWGtPF3ocYat744ztWuSliD_UU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884441/vpavic_191127_untitled_0059_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qAjehf"&gt;An outage of Sony’s PlayStation Network that began Friday afternoon appeared to be persisting on Saturday morning. According to an &lt;a href="https://status.playstation.com/"&gt;update on the status page&lt;/a&gt; timestamped 6:33PM (not clear what time zone that is) on February 26th, the affected platforms are PS Vita, PS3, PS4, and PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZKN9e"&gt;“You might have difficulty launching games, apps, or network features. We’re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience,” the update reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwO4MO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/psn-is-down-ps4-ps5-022654065.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the outage may be affecting some games but not others; &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; appeared to be accessible but &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; were not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3iaWD"&gt;The PlayStation Network outage began a day after Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301763/xbox-live-down-sign-in-issues-microsoft-support"&gt;Xbox Live service suffered a global outage&lt;/a&gt; for five hours. On February 10th, the PlayStation Network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277439/sony-playstation-network-global-outage"&gt;was down worldwide&lt;/a&gt; for about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyqHFh"&gt;We’ve reached out to Sony for details about what’s causing the outage, how widespread it is, and when it may be resolved, and will update when we learn more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAdqqM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are this week’s best gadget deals all in one place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ml73VgVNXPJGXMpiCWJMbElq9nI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68884376/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_E3_2019_screenshot_6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4HP5U"&gt;This week’s batch of deals runs the gamut of gadgets and games. Whether you’re a music fan who’s looking to outfit their tech repertoire with new headphones or a big, powerful Bluetooth speaker, or a gamer, this roundup is for you. There still aren’t any deals on hard-to-find graphics cards, but the good news is at least AMD’s powerful Zen 3 processors are in stock right now (but perhaps not for long). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mT0YM"&gt;If you aren’t finding what you’re looking for in today’s roundup, keep a lock on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Deals coverage&lt;/a&gt; throughout the week and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VergeDeals"&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for the moment-to-moment deal alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RuLbSh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OdOtr0"&gt;Get the best-ever price on Beats Solo Pro on-ear headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sgpO1I"&gt;Beats Solo Pro noise-canceling headphones are still available for $150 through Woot. You can get either the dark blue or light blue colors. Since they’re new, the one-year manufacturer warranty is directly through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Te9oC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ihWUiw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="byhs2x"&gt;Ultimate Ears Hyperboom brings the noise, and it’s $59 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6cqmqe"&gt;Ultimate Ears makes good Bluetooth speakers. Its latest model is its biggest yet: the Hyperboom. It’s waterproof and portable with its built-in strap. You can connect up to two Bluetooth devices to it, and its digital optical port means it can serve as a home theater system in a pinch. This is a pricey speaker, but it’s a versatile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqZyXJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10359731"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vbcNB9"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XXk6hf"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4 / PS5 is half off its usual price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p6esZ3"&gt;Sony announced Friday that &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302776/finalfantasy-7-remake-free-playstation-plus-march-2021"&gt;will be available as a free download&lt;/a&gt; for PS Plus members in June. This seems like perfect news, given Square Enix just revealed that the PS4 version can be upgraded to the PS5 version for no extra cost later in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;June 2021&lt;/a&gt;. But, there’s a catch: this complimentary version can’t receive the free upgrade. Only by purchasing the game on disc or through the PS Store digitally can you earn the upgrade when you move to PS5. (Confusing, no?) In that case, this $30 deal for the disc-based version is a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mGqYRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JLGLZ6"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yCKvDP"&gt;AMD’s high-end Zen 3 processor is back in stock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pjCPbV"&gt;If you’ve been a-swingin’ and a-missin’ on every opportunity to get some new PC components, including a processor, check this out. Several retailers have AMD’s latest Ryzen 7 5800X eight-core processor. It’s based on Zen 3 architecture, and it’s about as next-gen as processors come at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Uj31E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10363165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QknE2X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
