    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C2cDn1"&gt;Grab the second-gen Apple AirPods at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for just $89&lt;/a&gt;, matching the lowest price we’ve seen for these earbuds. This model normally costs around $120 and doesn’t include the wireless charging case. This model of the ubiquitous white earbuds wasn’t a big step forward compared to the first iteration, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was still happy with their wireless performance and overall reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ss1wLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPd26T"&gt;A pair of Samsung’s best QLED TVs have been marked down at Amazon and Best Buy as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;. QLED TVs aren’t quite as feature-packed as competing OLED models, but they come closer to reaching parity with their brightness and contrast ratios than cheaper LED TVs. The 65-inch QN90A from Samsung is currently marked down to $1,700 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3K77SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYn0pZSaa5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, roughly $400 cheaper than the MSRP, and the lowest price we’ve seen for this model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qE8BKi"&gt;The high-end 65-inch QN800A has also hit its all-time low at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYnu6caUw0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Class-QN800A-Built/dp/B08VJMWWHJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and is marked down to $2,500 at both retailers. This model has many of the same benefits as the QN90A above, such as smart assistant capability and access to the Tizen streaming platform, however, the GN800A is capable of a maximum 8K resolution in addition to 4K playback at 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VMx7cU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pwW56P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857302"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="laR87h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NB9tPD"&gt;This 48-inch soundbar from the audio experts at Klipsch is currently enjoying a deep discount at Woot. This same system is discounted elsewhere for as low as $600, but &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13140759?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fklipsch-bar48-5-1-surround-sound-system-4%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_5_5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot currently has the best price at $480&lt;/a&gt;. This is easily the best price we’ve seen on this system so far, and it matches the price we’ve seen for similar 5.1 sound systems from JBL and Sony. This system comes packaged with wireless rear-channel speakers and a wireless subwoofer to keep cable clutter to a minimum, and while this soundbar only has a single HDMI port, this shouldn’t be an issue as long as your TV has an audio return channel (HDMI ARC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TJtMvl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857246"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZRMVt"&gt;A mainstay of the noise-canceling headphone category, the Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II are currently discounted by $100 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $300, they’re $200 for now. Available in black and silver, these robust noise-canceling headphones offer up to 20 hours of playtime between charges, and you have the choice between using Alexa or Google Assistant capabilities to direct playback or search for music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Sm2ou"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FL3azF"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti USB microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments with its optional software download, which also allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and fine-tune your audio in other ways you might find to be useful. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of mic arms if that’s more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, gray, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P0EAmE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BAsMY2"&gt;Available by itself or as part of a bundle, the Abode Cam 2 is an excellent entry point for anyone who wants to step up their home security, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2Fproduct%2Fabode-cam-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22774231%2Fapple-airpods-samsung-tv-soundbar-bose-headphones-steelseries-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and at $25&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have a hard time finding a better value. This versatile little indoor / outdoor camera can be mounted nearly anywhere and provides you with motion detection, two-way communication, and low-light recording. While it isn’t compatible with Apple HomeKit, it does play well with both Alexa and Google Assistant. However, this camera doesn’t have local storage, so access to some of its best features requires a subscription to one of the Abode plans, either $6 / month for motion-activated recording or $15 / month to have the camera record 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XILNgW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10856996"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tVCt71"&gt;The tail end of our deals roundup today is a big one. In anticipation of Black Friday, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fblackfriday&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22774231%2Fapple-airpods-samsung-tv-soundbar-bose-headphones-steelseries-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SteelSeries has discounted the entirety of its peripheral catalog by as much as 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;, with many of these accessories available for their lowest price ever. The only caveat is that you need to have a SteelSeries account to take part. The Arctis Pro headset and GameDAC is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-pro-gamedac%3Fcolor%3Dblack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22774231%2Fapple-airpods-samsung-tv-soundbar-bose-headphones-steelseries-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $160&lt;/a&gt; — a wired headset available in black or white and compatible with PlayStation or Windows platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bxoisb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0ZMUis"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XqPboy"&gt;The Apex Pro keyboard, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-keyboards%2Fapex-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22774231%2Fapple-airpods-samsung-tv-soundbar-bose-headphones-steelseries-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $160&lt;/a&gt;, does something unique among mechanical keyboards by allowing you to fine-tune the actuation distance for each individual key. Another neat addition is a small OLED screen that can provide you with contextual info like profile selection or volume adjustment, or you can use it to play GIFs, if that's your thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8OEXdh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612568"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tDyNdo"&gt;Adopting the incredibly popular honeycomb shell design to shed a few ounces, the Aerox 3 Wireless has been &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Faerox-3-wireless&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22774231%2Fapple-airpods-samsung-tv-soundbar-bose-headphones-steelseries-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $70&lt;/a&gt;, taking $30 off the regular retail price. Weighing in at a paltry 68 grams, the Aerox 3 Wireless features Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity and has a maximum DPI of 18K. The mouse is rechargeable via USB-C and SteelSeries claims it lasts up to 200 hours between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJEozH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="rBkj1p"&gt;The Beats Studio Buds are available refurbished in every color through Best Buy, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYJKNQOC64" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $95&lt;/a&gt;. These originally sold for $150, and Best Buy claims that they include all original accessories (three sizes of ear tips, a USB-C cable, and a sticker).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Subaru reveals the Solterra SUV, its first electric vehicle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World Premier Of Subaru’s First All-Electric SUV Solterra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtcwgEE8waQS7w2TLgcyJBjmSMw=/0x0:5112x3408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126763/1236489408.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NTvRaB"&gt;Here’s our first good look at the 2022 Subaru Solterra, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430524/subaru-solterra-ev-electric-suv-2022-release-us-europe-japan-toyota"&gt;the Japanese automaker’s first electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt;. Coming to the US, Canada, and Europe in 2022, the Solterra SUV will be powered by an electric vehicle platform that Subaru has been co-developing with Toyota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r41mon"&gt;The Solterra will come in both front-wheel and all-wheel drive variants, with either a 150kW (201 horsepower) AC synchronous motor driving just the front wheels or a pair of 80kW (107 hp) motors, one powering each axle, for a total output of 160kW (214hp). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPA7qV"&gt;Both models sport a 71.4kWh battery beneath the floor of the vehicle, which Subaru estimates will supply approximately 530km (329 miles) of range based on the WLTC standard in Japan. (The EPA rating in the US is likely to be less.) And the all-wheel drive version will get 460km (286 miles) of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JMHH4K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10859067"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rtnEVe"&gt;When the battery is running low, the Solterra can support DC fast charging up to 150kW — although Subaru didn’t provide estimates for how long it would take. By comparison, Toyota has said that its BZ4X, which is built on the same EV platform, will take 30 minutes to charge to 80 percent capacity. The BZ4X is also due out in 2022 and will be built on this shared platform, which Toyota calls the e-TNGA and Subaru calls e-Subaru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FkTnth"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both models sport a 71.4kWh battery beneath the floor of the vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VG5CDy"&gt;Unlike the BZ4X, though, the Solterra appears to have a normal interior and steering wheel. (Toyota is including an optional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752539/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-steering-yoke-solar-roof"&gt;steering yoke&lt;/a&gt; in its electric SUV.)  Subaru says that like its other gas-powered SUVs, the Solterra will feature the company’s X-Mode AWD control system that “enhances the sense of security on rough roads.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6D2xL"&gt;It’s also added a new “Grip Control function, which enables the vehicle to run at a constant speed while stabilizing the vehicle even on rough roads, the capability is further enhanced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PxSHG"&gt;When it comes out next year, Subaru will no doubt be competing with Rivian for its customer base of outdoorsy adventure types. The company hasn’t revealed the Solterra’s starting price, but it’s likely to be less expensive than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;the Rivian R1S SUV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian’s mega IPO is a good test of the meme stock craze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EV Maker Rivian Raises $11.9 Billion In Year’s Biggest IPO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mlcKe6Cix6EDDS9n_j7VqfnohQw=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126669/1236479813.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Lmaoooo 80B do they think we’re fucking stupid?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="aTsRub"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;Rivian’s hotly anticipated public debut is finally here&lt;/a&gt;, but the electric vehicle company is not generating the same kind of feverish online posting as its rival Tesla or other EV startups — and that’s probably a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et3tjS"&gt;Don’t get me wrong. The company’s IPO, which will net $12 billion on an $80 billion valuation, is proving to be an immensely attractive stock and is already drawing comparisons to other historic public offerings like Facebook. But for anyone who gets their investment news from Reddit forums like r/WallStreetBets, the Rivian IPO was more likely to draw an eye-roll, an off-color remark, or a crude emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwcapE"&gt;“Lmaoooo 80B do they think we’re fucking stupid?” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pcp4jv/comment/hakj2nl/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;one user wrote last month&lt;/a&gt; in response to the news about Rivian’s upcoming IPO. “Bro they must think since stonks only go up, this shit will surpass it with no prob. What a crazy year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7eYSPJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Lmaoooo 80B do they think we’re fucking stupid?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jw9bqR"&gt;Tesla’s status as a meme stock has helped propel the Bay Area-based (and soon to be Austin, Texas-based) company’s share price into the stratosphere and make its CEO Elon Musk one of the richest people in the world. The share price has been on an upward trajectory since early 2020 and has shown little signs of flagging. Even mundane headlines like Tesla’s not-a-deal with rental car agency Hertz was enough to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;push Musk’s company past the $1 trillion mark&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTYsA4"&gt;Which is not to say being a meme stock is a safe space to occupy. An errant tweet from Musk last year about the stock being overvalued sent the share price tumbling and wiped out $14 billion of Tesla’s market value. The Federal Reserve thinks meme stocks &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-thinks-meme-stocks-threaten-the-financial-structure-retail-investors-say-thats-kind-of-the-point-11636498740"&gt;threaten the stability of the financial system&lt;/a&gt;, to which retail investors say that’s kind of the point. Meanwhile, Tesla has regained the value it lost after Musk’s tweet, and then some. (Musk is in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775485/elon-musk-twitter-poll-tesla-stock-option-sold-taxes"&gt;selling off 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; of his shares in Tesla.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z1HUg"&gt;On November 10th, the day of Rivian’s big public debut, Tesla’s stock was still the most popular ticker on Reddit, according to &lt;a href="https://apewisdom.io/"&gt;Ape Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks the popular stocks on the message board. Rivian is listed as the seventh most popular stock, beating other meme stocks like GameStop and AMC but trailing regular ones like DoorDash and Palantir. The next day, Rivian had dropped to ninth place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxwkEW"&gt;“Being a meme stock, to some extent, is conjuring the dark arts of the world,” said Reilly Brennan, general partner at venture capital firm Trucks. “It’s really hard to do it consistently over a long period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0E1PqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being a meme stock, to some extent, is conjuring the dark arts of the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsdMcb"&gt;Rivian’s future is unwritten, but the company doesn’t seem to have the necessary ingredients to make a meme stock. Its founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, is not especially active on Twitter, does not court controversy for the sake of controversy, and doesn’t appear to aspire to anything other than leading a company that makes really great electric trucks, SUVs, and vans. If he has an edgy sense of humor, we’ve yet to see evidence of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCSp3E"&gt;Rivian has far fewer online fans than Tesla by virtue of the fact that its vehicles have yet to reach customers. (The company’s electric truck, the R1T, is expected to begin deliveries before the end of the year.) But the company appears to be cultivating a customer base of wealthy outdoors types — not necessarily the type of person who would project their own identity onto an EV company and then respond to any criticism of said company by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/cars/tesla-ntsb-cummings/index.html"&gt;losing their shit online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t8DMq"&gt;If meme stocks, in essence, represent a middle finger to institutional investors and short-sellers, then Rivian was already going to have a tough row to hoe. The company has yet to find itself in the crosshairs of any major short-seller. And Rivian has a host of brand-name backers, such as Amazon (which owns 20 percent of the company) and Ford (which helped manufacture all of the company’s preproduction vehicles). Investing in Rivian would hardly demonstrate any rebellion against the system. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xqs3Mt"&gt;Rivian’s slow and deliberate approach stands in contrast to other companies that briefly achieved meme stock status, only to watch it slip away. Hydrogen trucking startup Nikola was able to run up a $30 billion valuation on little more than a few buzzy videos and a CEO doing his best Musk impression. But after going public, and just as the startup was about to secure an investment from General Motors, Nikola’s then CEO Trevor Milton was accused of lying to investors. Milton eventually stepped down and, this year, was arrested and indicted on multiple counts of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a92zyg"&gt;Rivian’s lack of meme-worthy moments makes it an interesting test case for the public market’s appetite for what Brennan calls a “pure play” EV company — an automaker that is only making electric vehicles. Major car companies like Ford and GM are often left talking out of both sides of their mouth, touting huge investments in EV production and battery manufacturing, while also continuing to sell gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs that pollute the environment. Other pure EV companies, like Lucid Motors, went public by merging with a blank-check company, or SPAC, and all the risks that entails. Rivian doesn’t have that same kind of baggage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahfyKt"&gt;“The company has very little in the way of meme currency,” Brennan, who is not an investor in the company, said. “They haven’t done a lot of the things that the rest of the market has done, whether you’re talking about the brand new EV SPAC [special acquisition] companies or Tesla. So I just think inherently there’s a quiet storm aspect of Rivian’s growth over the next few years, which is utterly fascinating.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lord of the Rings keycap sets will transport your keyboard to Middle-earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wmPLZuoin-vaO2HjDBzjsVS_Xs=/0x1:1640x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126652/GVMLHVlITSCpaN5zqO4t_elvish_0545_copy_pdp_red.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Elvish Tengwar keycaps | Image: Drop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZemjZ0"&gt;It began with the forging of the Great Keyboards. Sixty-eight keys were given to the 65 percent designs, smallest and most compact of all decks. Eighty-four keys to the 75 percent designs, great typists and gamers of the digital halls. And 108 keys were gifted to the race of full-size keyboard users, who above all else desire power. For within these keyboards was bound the strength and the will to govern any device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNHEfI"&gt;But they were all of them deceived, for another keyboard was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Jony Ive forged a master keyboard, and into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/27/21270299/apple-butterfly-keyboard-hardware-design-macbook-pro-physical-key-button"&gt;this butterfly keyboard&lt;/a&gt; he poured his &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life?zd=3&amp;amp;zi=opbqt4er"&gt;cruelty&lt;/a&gt;, his malice and his will to dominate all life. — excerpt, &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Keys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nk6eWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; is famous for the intricate languages that Tolkien crafted to flesh out the world of Middle-earth. Now, thanks to some new keycaps from &lt;a href="https://matt3o.com/"&gt;mechanical keyboard designer Matt3o&lt;/a&gt;, you can now outfit your keyboard with some incredible-looking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-the-lord-of-the-rings-mt3-elvish-keycap-set&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22776088%2Flord-of-the-rings-keycap-sets-elvish-tengwar-dwarvish-tolkien-drop-matt3o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;custom Elvish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-the-lord-of-rings-mt3-dwarvish-keycap-set&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22776088%2Flord-of-the-rings-keycap-sets-elvish-tengwar-dwarvish-tolkien-drop-matt3o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dwarvish keycaps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdzA7Y"&gt;Matt3o has been working on the official &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-inspired designs for over a year, but he’s been dabbling in Elvish keycaps for years, going all the way back to his low-profile DSA Granite design in 2016 (which had an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fgranite-keycap-set%3Fmode%3Dguest_open&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F11%2F22776088%2Flord-of-the-rings-keycap-sets-elvish-tengwar-dwarvish-tolkien-drop-matt3o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;optional Tengwar set available&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OGeemvYqjLTsnvX4y0vFfy2jHWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005139/6TxfDqUrSbODP5qp0SzG_dwarven_0061_pdp_cc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Drop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt3o’s Dwarvish keycaps, with the alternate Durin’s forge accent keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KmyZEG"&gt;But unlike Matt3o’s original release, though, the new &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; keycaps are actually licensed by Middle-earth Enterprises (the company that owns the rights to key film and merchandise aspects of the &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;novels). That means that along with full keyboards in both Tengwar (the Elvish script) and Dwarven runes, there’s also a plethora of novelty keys featuring key iconography from Middle-earth, including Eye of Sauron escape keys, One Ring-branded command keys, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaUnAW"&gt;A key part of that is due to the extremely complex world of Tolkien licensing, which is split between several companies. It includes the Tolkien Estate, which owns the copyrights to the books, and New Line Cinema / Warner Bros., which made the iconic film adaptations and retains the rights to its visual recreation of Tolkien’s world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UeUKKW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One keyboard to rule them all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="arMDBT"&gt;That meant that &lt;a href="https://matt3o.com/developing-a-tolkien-keycap-set/"&gt;Matt3o had to design iconography&lt;/a&gt; from scratch, instead of drawing on past interpretations. The actual translation work is fun, too — obviously, Elvish doesn’t quite have words for modern, technical commands leading to some interesting approximations. (“Print Screen,” for example, becomes “teitho parf” — or literally, “write a book.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlMBtd"&gt;The new sets come in “training” versions that feature both the created language key legends alongside traditional English characters, in addition to “hardcore” kits that are purely in Elvish or Dwarvish. The base set includes all the keys you need for a standard tenkeyless layout (meaning there are no numpad keys) for a preorder price of $100. And there are plenty of extra add-ons for larger or niche keyboard designs as well as optional accent color sets for those looking for a little extra visual flair. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJ5tdqJHQUzWz5P0eLawi3shWsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005143/ECw3MESxSh2aOXjtwRxB_elvish_0272_copy.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Drop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the alternate keycap designs available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F3lxor"&gt;Due to the complexity of the custom characters, the new keycaps are made from PBT plastic and have dye-sublimated legends, rather than using double-shot ABS. They’re designed in an MT3 profile and should fit standard Cherry MX switches and clones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fm9H1m"&gt;Unfortunately, Matt3o had to abandon their plans for a third set in the Black Speech (the dark language of Mordor spoken by orcs and used for the infamous inscription on the One Ring) — despite Tolkien’s fastidious work in his various created languages for the world of Middle-earth, there just simply wasn’t enough reference text to create a whole keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0vlwt"&gt;Preorders for the new keycap sets are available now, with shipping set to start on January 18th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-11-11T06:54:46-05:00</updated>
    <title>Microsoft’s Windows store is finally becoming more Steam-like for games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DpiKQqcyOkIgHe6c-bJt94tjmCI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126103/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RXIRTa"&gt;Microsoft will finally allow Windows users to install PC games from the Microsoft Store or Xbox Game Pass for PC to any folder of their choice with unrestricted access. The move will allow PC gamers to access the folders of games and mod them freely, or let Windows users move games freely to any folders or drives of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfAdtX"&gt;Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the changes are part of an Xbox app update for Windows that’s currently being tested internally. The Xbox app update will finally address a big pain point of installing games from Xbox Game Pass for PC, where players would run into issues with the Microsoft Store, the restricted WindowsApps folder, or just the inability to fully control where games were installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ouAGdAa503Xd19UsO5cDyy3B-vo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005014/CTLoY7O.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft won’t block you getting access to game folders soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0nQYWq"&gt;While Microsoft has supported mods for certain titles in the Microsoft Store previously, opening up the folder access to games will now enable more games to support mods without players needing to enable this in games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVocqk"&gt;The Microsoft Store has traditionally restricted access to where games are installed using Windows-based folder permissions that make it difficult to backup games or move them freely. This is a headache if you ever need to reinstall Windows and you install games to a secondary drive, or if you uninstall a game installed from the Microsoft Store and it still uses up disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3lMb"&gt;Other PC game launchers like Steam or Battle.net allow players to backup games and restore and verify them. Microsoft’s new Xbox app update includes an option to verify and repair files, which will presumably be used to support backing up games. There are also new options to browse to where files are installed, change the drive where games are installed, and pick custom folders for installs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENSc53jd2g2UCt3D0P_ruQbEPas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005017/cJJYxOU.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox app on Windows is getting more game install options soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CIWHct"&gt;We asked Microsoft about its internal test of this updated Xbox app, and surprisingly the company confirmed its more open approach to installing PC games from the Microsoft Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHdkxr"&gt;“With great PC games like &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;on day one with Game Pass, we wanted to provide players with more options to customize their experience in the Xbox app,” says a Jason Beaumont, partner director of experiences at Xbox. “We’ll continue to share updates as we launch additional features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NrCgr"&gt;The Xbox app update is currently being tested internally at Microsoft, and the company hasn’t publicly detailed these new install features just yet. We’re expecting the updated app to appear soon, particularly as Microsoft is getting ready to launch a free-to-play version of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer on December 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta blurs nude images for children using Messages app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ZZ1sPIkrsfwTYCTNkf1mYR8iPw=/0x1:920x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70126082/child_safety__cemgn2jzflqq_large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promotional images of the feature released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mnUVnE"&gt;iOS 15.2’s latest beta adds an Apple Communication Safety feature to the Messages app, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The opt-in feature is designed to protect children from inappropriate imagery by scanning incoming and outgoing pictures for “sexually explicit” material. Any images meeting this description are blurred, and the child will be warned about its contents and told it’s ok not to view it. The feature, which ties into Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201060"&gt;existing Family Sharing system&lt;/a&gt;, is also designed to offer resources to affected children for them to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGXNnV"&gt;The version of the feature that’s released in iOS 15.2’s latest beta has one crucial difference from what Apple originally announced in August: it won’t send notifications to parents if a child decides to view a sexually explicit image. Critics like Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic instructor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114"&gt;Kendra Albert&lt;/a&gt; objected to this element in particular because it could out queer or transgender children to their parents. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; also notes that in its original form, the feature could have introduced safety issues when a parent is violent or abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zJmBEN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xmUOH6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-to-beta-test-imessage-feature-that-warns-kids-about-nude-imagery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that children will instead have the choice of whether to alert someone they trust about a flagged photo, and that this choice is separate from the choice of whether to unblur and view the image. Checks are carried out on-device, and do not impact end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nie4hK"&gt;The Communication Safety feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;originally announced in August&lt;/a&gt; as part of a trio of features designed to protect children from sexual abuse. However, the company said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delaying the introduction of the features the following month&lt;/a&gt; in response to objections raised by privacy advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMjijr"&gt;Communication Safety is distinct from the CSAM-detection (child sexual abuse imagery detection) feature that scans a user’s iCloud Photos and reports offending content to Apple moderators, and which generated the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;bulk of the outcry from privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an update coming to Siri search that’s designed to offer resources if a user searches for topics relating to child sexual abuse. It’s currently unclear when these two features are planned for release, and there haven’t been reports of them appearing in Apple’s public beta software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcRKjg"&gt;It’s worth noting that features added to iOS 15.2’s latest beta could still change dramatically before its official release, and it may be removed from the update entirely. Other new features that have arrived in the latest beta include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manual AirTag scanning feature&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;pass on your iCloud data to a loved one&lt;/a&gt; in the case of your death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt11Ji"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iCloud for Windows gets a built in password generator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTR8LPK4HIUJA_zKsdOu1Co9xHE=/1x0:1198x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125933/2021_11_10_18_45_58_Microsoft_Store.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud for Windows’ password manager in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: iCloud for Windows&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2sLgL"&gt;A new update for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Ficloud%2F9pktq5699m62%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Windows app&lt;/a&gt; has added a password generator, as well as support for Apple’s ProRaw and ProRes photo and video formats to the cloud storage utility. The update, which was first &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/10/icloud-windows-13/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also adds the ability for participants of a shared iCloud Drive file or folder to add or remove other users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fF7JP0"&gt;The addition of a password generator makes Apple’s iCloud keychain a much more viable cross-platform password manager. It follows an update in August which &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3629310/apple-brings-icloud-passwords-to-windows-microsofts-edge.html"&gt;allowed Windows users to access&lt;/a&gt; (but not generate) passwords from their iCloud account. Together with the &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3605098/icloud-passwords-are-coming-to-chrome-for-windows.html"&gt;Chrome iCloud extension&lt;/a&gt; Apple released at the beginning of the year, Windows iCloud users now have access to basic password management features when they’re away from their Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WzA8Mz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plus new options to remove other users from shared files&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QpS9fs"&gt;Given the option, I’d personally still recommend that anyone looking for a password manager opt for a true platform-agnostic alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;I recommend Bitwarden as the best free option&lt;/a&gt;, because as well as being available on Mac, iOS, and Windows, it’s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; available on Android, so you’re not locked in to Apple’s mobile platform if you want to switch in future. But using iCloud Keychain is better than not using a password manager at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GmrpN"&gt;Meanwhile, the addition of ProRes and ProRaw support is useful given that the latest iPhones are now capable of shooting in both formats. Making it easier to sync these with your Windows PC should be useful if you want to view them, or more likely edit them, on a Windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony reportedly making even fewer PS5s due to component shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wp2iyK"&gt;Sony is struggling to make PlayStation 5 consoles and has internally lowered its production forecast for the current financial year, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/sony-trims-playstation-5-assembly-plans-after-chip-shortages-hit"&gt;report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. While the company was expecting to assemble 16 million units between April 2021 and March 2022, that figure is reportedly now at around 15 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cJk0Z"&gt;Sony had publicly predicted that it would sell 14.8 million PS5 consoles this financial year, so while this isn’t a large downward revision, it shows just how tight the supply is likely to be for the foreseeable future. The figure of 16 million units would have allowed Sony to meet that goal while securing additional stock for the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XyrUFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the global chip shortage is making it so hard to buy a PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NcUkdQ"&gt;Sony is said to be having trouble with logistics as well as the supply of components, as the world grapples with an unprecedented chip shortage. Bloomberg’s report says that component shipments aren’t always arriving on time, and varying levels of vaccine rollout have complicated operations at production bases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3tyj3"&gt;Sony has forecast 22.6 million PS5 sales for the financial year beginning in April 2022, but its manufacturing partners reportedly think it will be difficult to meet that target. In other words, don’t expect it to get any easier to buy a PS5 any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woUz1F"&gt;Earlier this month Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;cut its Switch sales forecast&lt;/a&gt; by 1.5 million for the financial year due to the component shortage. Valve’s Steam Deck handheld PC has just been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;delayed by two months&lt;/a&gt; for similar reasons and now won’t ship until February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge buys Rittenhouse lawyer’s inane argument that Apple’s pinch-to-zoom manipulates footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Continues In Kenosha, WI" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zDVoE_-vlqC4mlIOTgC89V94i-Q=/0x0:5043x3362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125363/1236486033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vmv9F2"&gt;As Kyle Rittenhouse took the stand to answer questions about the sequence of events before he shot and killed a man in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the jury was forced to watch the video evidence play out in miniature — because Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer came up with the wild notion that Apple has “artificial intelligence” that manipulates footage when you pinch-to-zoom on an iPad, and Judge Bruce Schroeder totally bought into that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raJUzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The word he’s looking for is algorithms, but that’s beside the point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYw2Ho"&gt;“iPads, which are made by Apple, have artificial intelligence in them that allow things to be viewed through three-dimensions and logarithms,” the defense insisted. “It uses artificial intelligence, or their logarithms, to create what they believe is happening. So this isn’t actually enhanced video, this is Apple’s iPad programming creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltjm5U"&gt;While it’s unclear from a full video of the proceedings (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIzj48oL6T0&amp;amp;t=18145s"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) whether the judge actually prohibited the prosecution from using an iOS device or otherwise zooming into the footage, the result was the same: instead of using an iPad, the jury wound up watching the original, zoomed-out clips on a Windows machine hooked up to a large TV in the courtroom. The images didn’t fill the TV’s entire screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WuBA4y4JkmyBJzK_40Pt0j2In-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004713/image__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the first video clips Rittenhouse was questioned about, as presented to the jury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9zoKjo"&gt;Judge Schroeder argued that it was the prosecution — not the defense — that had the burden of proving that Apple &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; use artificial intelligence to manipulate footage, demanding that they provide an expert to testify, and didn’t allow the prosecution to adjourn to find that expert before bringing Rittenhouse up for cross-examination. The judge suggested that prosecutors could somehow find that expert in 20 minutes while they took a brief recess. “Maybe you can get someone to testify on this within minutes, I don’t know,” said the judge. No such expert was there by the time the trial resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD9xmb"&gt;While the nature of reality with regards to digital images is thorny when it comes to things like color, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling"&gt;digital image scaling&lt;/a&gt; is fairly well understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GflCas"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-charges.html"&gt;six criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Rittenhouse in connection to the shooting in Kenosha. He’s accused of killing two people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Iuii"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX successfully launches four astronauts on Crew-3 mission to the space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwt70DEjJtfqmlUjZSoIrXBE2dU=/0x33:3044x2062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125357/51671227928_189f01b129_o.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket carries the Crew-3 astronauts to space&lt;/em&gt; | (NASA/Joel Kowsky)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BzOflP"&gt;This evening, SpaceX successfully launched another crew of four on their way to the International Space Station, marking the fifth time the company has sent people to space. Riding inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, the spacefarers will now spend roughly the next day in orbit lapping the Earth, before docking with the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEdct"&gt;The mission, called Crew-3, is carrying three NASA astronauts — Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron — and one German astronaut, Matthias Maurer of the European Space Agency. After a number of launch delays, the foursome finally took off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida at 9:03PM ET, launching on top of one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets. After successfully boosting the Crew Dragon carrying the passengers into low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 then turned back toward Earth and performed one of SpaceX’s signature rocket landings on the company’s drone ship in the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoZgBI"&gt;“Welcome to orbit,” SpaceX mission control said to the crew when they’d separated from the rest of the rocket. “Hope you enjoyed the ride from [the Falcon 9]. Dragon will take you from here. Safe travels.” The launch director also sent his warm wishes to the crew. “It was a pleasure to be part of this mission with you,” he said. “Enjoy your holidays amongst the stars. We’ll be waving as you fly by. Cheers.” Chari responded on board that it was “a great ride, better than we imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jciy4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is SpaceX’s third operational crewed mission for NASA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxyVn7"&gt;This is SpaceX’s third operational crewed mission for NASA as part of the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html"&gt;Commercial Crew Program&lt;/a&gt;. Each mission, including Crew-3, is supposed to last roughly six months, with SpaceX responsible for launching the astronauts and also bringing them home again. The Crew-3 astronauts are slated to come home sometime in spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jd5vh9-oc_h0meMIgT4XfGIlju8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004659/51671408764_56a9429b71_o.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crew-3 astronauts saying goodbye to their families ahead of the launch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NkOewb"&gt;SpaceX’s primary way of getting people to orbit is the Crew Dragon, an automated capsule outfitted with sleek seats and interactive touchscreens. The capsule is also designed to dock automatically with the space station, without the need of input from the crew on board. At around 7:10PM ET tomorrow, November 11th, the Crew Dragon carrying the Crew-3 team will attempt to dock with the ISS, and then about an hour later, the astronauts will open the hatch and enter the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLNdFH"&gt;There, they’ll be greeted by the three crew members already living on the ISS: NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov. Once inside the station, the seven inhabitants will do a short welcoming ceremony around 9:20PM ET. Maruer is officially the 600th person to fly to space, while Barron is the 601st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlI4W3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Crew-3 crew just missed out on crossing paths with another batch of astronauts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwasEp"&gt;The Crew-3 crew just missed out on crossing paths with another batch of astronauts on the space station, though. A crew of four astronauts, part of SpaceX’s Crew-2 mission, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769970/spacex-crew-2-dragon-capsule-splash-down-success"&gt;left the ISS on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, flying back to Earth inside their own Crew Dragon and splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico. Originally, Crew-3 was supposed to launch &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the Crew-2 astronauts returned, but a series of delays kept stalling the Crew-3 launch. Eventually, NASA opted to bring the Crew-2 astronauts home ahead of Crew-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdmO1p"&gt;“Sometimes when you try to fly on Halloween, you get a trick instead of a treat,” Chari told SpaceX mission control ahead of the launch, referencing the fact that their mission was supposed to take place on October 31st. Chari noted it was instead an honor to fly on Veteran’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sepl3D"&gt;The Crew-2 return occurred on Monday, November 8th and the astronauts splashed down just fine. However, one of the capsule’s four main parachutes inflated a little slower than the rest on the way down to the water. The capsule still landed the crew safely, and neither NASA nor SpaceX thought it warranted delaying today’s launch. Additionally, NASA said that the turnaround between the splashdown and today’s launch was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bnjacobs/status/1458619316216160258"&gt;the shortest in human spaceflight history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS1bbQ"&gt;Ahead of today’s launch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22747319/spacex-liftoff-crew-3-nasa-iss-how-to-watch-live"&gt;NASA had to do a small maneuver with the ISS&lt;/a&gt; first to make sure it didn’t get hit by space debris. Around 3:30PM ET, the thrusters on board a docked Russian Progress vehicle fired up, moving the space station slightly higher and out of the way of a fragment from an old Chinese satellite called Fengyun-1C. The boost paved the way for the Crew-3 team to reach the space station tomorrow safely.&lt;/p&gt;
