    <title>Fantasian wraps up with part two release on August 13th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgUQhIj0UdrbC5vIpukvmAVQBFQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700059/ss007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cxtx4f"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a beautiful roleplaying game from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, first debuted on Apple Arcade, it wasn’t actually the full game. Instead, it was described as the first part of a longer story. Now the conclusion to that story is almost upon us: part two of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian &lt;/em&gt;is launching this Friday, August 13th as part of Arcade’s weekly update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXOEht"&gt;According to developer Mistwalker, the second half features “anywhere between 40 to 60 hours for players to experience.” It also introduces 50 new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;handcrafted vistas to explore&lt;/a&gt;, along with 34 new songs from famed composer Nobuo Uematsu. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586744/fantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu"&gt;His work on the game is also currently streaming on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45GpQa"&gt;In a statement, Sakaguchi said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Mjgbo8"&gt;The release of Part 2 of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; marks the completion of the saga. It ended up being, rather unexpectedly, about twice the volume of Part 1 and is more quest-driven, giving players the ability to progress through the world at their own pace. Boss encounters are even more unique than before. On behalf of all the dev team members, diorama artisans, and musical talent including Uematsu-san — I think we can safely say that we left nothing on the table. We have carefully sculpted the experience preserving the ‘warmth’ of the dioramas with every attention to detail. I encourage everyone to experience this mysterious ‘emotional’ energy, which is at the very heart of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ76c1"&gt;Alongside &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s big update, Apple’s gaming service will also get a brand-new game on Friday called &lt;em&gt;Wurdweb&lt;/em&gt;. It’s described as a “relaxing word puzzle game,” and it was co-developed by Aran Koning (part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18287223/sokpop-collective-patreon-experimental-games-subscription-crowdfunding-creators"&gt;the Sokpop Collective&lt;/a&gt;) and Adriaan de Jongh (best-known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15837528/hidden-folks-iphone-steam-factory-update"&gt;his work on &lt;em&gt;Hidden Folks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ariana Grande’s Fortnite tour was a moment years in the making</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xrR0eTo1s8qhtFkB9fWN_KDX9ro=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700007/Fortnite_20210807141447.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M2Sqt7"&gt;It’s hard to overstate just how weird &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is. At one point, while I was waiting for the game’s virtual Ariana Grande concert this weekend, three identical versions of Rick from &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; surrounded me and started dancing. Later, I walked by a pair of Marshmellos lounging in identical yellow beanbag chairs. The first show I went to I dressed as Travis Scott; later, I wore a Toronto Raptors jersey and had a dancing baby Groot strapped to my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0ywGd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s crash commercialism, where seemingly every fictional world collides with real-world celebrities in a battle royale game, can definitely be off-putting at times. But it also leads to some extremely cool moments, particularly when it comes to live events. And the Ariana Grande concert wasn’t just another exciting live music experience — it also built on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s history in fascinating ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tdpwi"&gt;For a game about dropping onto a colorful island with the intent of killing people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18537469/fortnite-map-island-history-neo-tilted-volcano"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has a surprising amount of history&lt;/a&gt;, due largely to the fact that developer Epic is constantly experimenting. Players who have stuck around for a while will remember key, game-shaping moments like when a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785756/fortnite-mystery-cube-obsession"&gt;mysterious cube rolled around the island&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521122/fortnite-rocket-launch-epic-games-dimensional-rift"&gt;when a rocket launched and cracked the sky&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;that time a black hole birthed an entirely new map&lt;/a&gt;. These moments can even make all of the heavy-handed licensed aspects of the game feel strangely natural, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;like when the island was inundated with iconic Marvel locations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gwhG6T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGYElBtjytU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRnxGY"&gt;The Ariana Grande tour felt like the culmination of this kind of integrated storytelling. Whereas previous concerts, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;, were one-off experiences, the Grande event tied into multiple aspects of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;the game is in the midst of an alien invasion&lt;/a&gt;. There are new sci-fi weapons to play with, flying saucers that suck up players, and an imposing mothership that floats above the island. Before players even knew a concert was happening, one of those saucers parked right above the center of the map and projected a holographic countdown clock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595880/fortnite-alien-event-date-chapter-2-season-7"&gt;teasing something big on August 6th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="rxITML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zqcyc8"&gt;Once things started, the event was different from past &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concerts, as it was about more than just music. Before Ariana Grande even appeared, players were ushered through a portal, where they saw glimpses of some of those big in-game events, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/4/18529463/fortnite-unvaulting-volcano-eruption-tilted-towers-destroyed-season-9"&gt;like the erupting volcano&lt;/a&gt;. What followed was a series of mini-game-style experiences: players slid along a paint-covered slide, bounced around a fluffy world straight out of &lt;em&gt;The Lorax&lt;/em&gt;, and piloted a plane to take down former &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; raid boss the Storm King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYwT1U"&gt;Finally, in a black room lit by stars, a towering Grande appeared, taking players through an extremely surreal world. There were giant floating bubbles in the sky, a ride on a glittering llama, an M.C. Escher-style castle, and finally the pop star emerging from a crack in the ground to smash all of her fans with a bejeweled hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FegCng"&gt;It was a lot of fun. But more importantly, it felt intrinsically &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. From the way the tour was announced, to the tie-ins with aliens and iconic &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; moments and imagery, it was another part of the game’s ever-growing mythos. Only this time with a pop star involved. Grande even looked like a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; character, with glowing white eyes and a dress made of shimmering shards of glass. (You can, of course, buy a skin so you can play as her in-game.) And now that the tour is over, there are still a series of in-game quests for players to dig through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAfzfx"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;Epic’s chief creative officer Donald Mustard described &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as&lt;/a&gt; “an opportunity to almost create a new medium.” He meant that the game and its scale offered a chance to tell stories in a novel way; &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a traditional plot or characters, but instead uses live events and its ever-changing world as tools to create a long-running narrative. Steadily, nearly every aspect of the game has been pulled into this focus on storytelling, even the copious licensed tie-ins. In &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, there’s little difference between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;Galactus attacking the island&lt;/a&gt; and Ariana Grande showing up to perform. In this game, a concert is no longer just a concert: it’s lore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket League’s next season brings changes to tournaments and a new cowboy-themed car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDnKUN85szKFwQ4l-03AduePISs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699886/VVlyZVbU.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new car available in &lt;/em&gt;Rocket League’s&lt;em&gt; fourth season.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Psyonix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jRaANz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s fourth season kicks off on Wednesday, bringing some big changes to tournaments, a setting to turn off copyrighted music, and a new cowboy-themed car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EspxBT"&gt;The changes to tournaments, which developer Psyonix &lt;a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/news/2v2-tournaments-and-more-coming-in-season-4/"&gt;first revealed on August 5th&lt;/a&gt;, include a new 2v2 mode, giving you an option to team up with just one other friend in competitive play. Psyonix is also adding many more tournaments — there will be “between eight and 13” more tournaments in each region, Psyonix said. And in addition to the new 2v2 and current 3v3 mode, the studio will host Extra Mode tournaments that will cycle between modes like Rumble (which has randomized power-ups), Hoops (a basketball-like mode), and Snow Day (&lt;em&gt;Rocket League’s &lt;/em&gt;take on hockey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6uiyns"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Get the Outlaw car in the Rocket Pass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DZiuzO"&gt;Season 4 will also add a new setting that allows players to turn off copyright-protected music in the game, which could help streamers avoid getting DMCA takedown notifications. If you flip on this setting, copyrighted audio will be “muted or replaced by music that is free to use,” Psyonix says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GalEjZ"&gt;The cowboy-themed Outlaw car will be available as part of the season four Rocket Pass, which is the game’s take on a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style battle pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFVdow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; season 4 will kick off on Wednesday at 11AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse is already redesigning its new electric van</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoSL5igvsQYUXFIAPqbzArCiMf4=/0x36:1449x1002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699679/E3nZHe_XMAED9jF.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Workhorse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b49uNC"&gt;Ohio-based startup Workhorse says it has to redesign its flagship electric van to meet customer needs, after finally getting the vehicle into production this past quarter following years of struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6odI9m"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/178/workhorse-group-reports-second-quarter-2021-results"&gt;announced Monday morning&lt;/a&gt; that it needs to “revise the design [of] the vehicle” to increase the payload capacity, which has been reported to be &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-ready-to-run-with-c-series-electric-delivery-van"&gt;around 6,000 pounds&lt;/a&gt;. The C-1000 van, as it’s called, has 1,000 cubic feet of cargo space. The company says the electric powertrain will remain untouched and that it will continue to deliver some C-1000s as they come off the line to customers who are fine with the van’s current capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mD4oLs"&gt;“We’re going to go through full vehicle design reviews down to the bill of materials with both our engineering team, and our purchasing team,” CEO Rick Dauch said on a call with investors. Dauch, who &lt;a href="https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/176/workhorse-appoints-richard-f-dauch-as-chief-executive"&gt;only just joined Workhorse at the end of July&lt;/a&gt;, said the company knew about these “issues” with the C-1000 “long before I got here.” He promised to release a revamped product roadmap by November but said he “can’t commit to have all the design plans specifically buttoned down” by then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m2XzHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new CEO says the issues were known “long before” he came on board&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TT8J4E"&gt;Dauch, who came from automotive supplier Delphi, tried to calm any nerves by teasing a recent call with one of the company’s prospective customers, which he says wanted to place an order for 1,500 to 2,000 vans as is. “I said hold off for now, let’s get the designs right, let’s get our production right, and we’ll come back and tell you when we’re ready to actually make those orders,” he says he told the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TRRIC"&gt;Dauch replaced prior CEO Duane Hughes as part of a series of shakeups in Workhorse’s executive ranks that came in the wake of the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;losing the bid to build the next-generation delivery vehicle&lt;/a&gt; for the United States Postal Service (USPS). That contract was awarded to defense manufacturer Oshkosh in February, though Workhorse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557764/workhorse-complaint-oshkosh-usps-mail-truck-fight"&gt;currently challenging the decision in federal court&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0zEsE"&gt;The decision to redesign the C-1000 van comes at a crucial moment for Workhorse. The startup has spent years trying to be the first to offer a fully electric delivery van and has drawn the attention of big-name customers like UPS and Ryder. But it has struggled to get the van (and its successor, a 650-cubic-foot variant) ready for production. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh"&gt;as the USPS contest dragged on&lt;/a&gt;, it survived for a while on money borrowed from hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5usQOG"&gt;In early 2019, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;licensed the intellectual property for an electric pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; it had in development to a new startup called Lordstown Motors — which was founded by Hughes’ predecessor, Steve Burns. In exchange, Workhorse received a 10 percent stake in Lordstown Motors as well as millions of dollars in licensing fees and royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z76DE"&gt;Lordstown Motors went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company late last year, and the value of Workhorse’s stake briefly ballooned to around $330 million. But Burns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;has since been accused of faking and lying about the number of preorders&lt;/a&gt; for Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;was ousted from the company&lt;/a&gt; in June. Lordstown Motors is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;now facing multiple federal investigations&lt;/a&gt; and has had to narrow the scope of its own plans to get into production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtiQUx"&gt;With that in mind, Workhorse also announced Monday that it recently sold 72 percent of its stake in Lordstown Motors to add to its cash reserves. (The company finished the quarter with $156 million in the bank, though it has lost $183 million through the first half of 2021.) As Lordstown Motors’ stock price has dropped amid the startup’s struggles, Workhorse said the sale is only expected to net around $79 million. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf’s new trailer teases a ton of monster-hunting action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkgQoKI7XGRWqFZ8Rtx0_tHugP8=/207x0:2232x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699662/Screen_Shot_2021_08_09_at_11.40.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cn9Of7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"&gt;Netflix’s anime &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; spinoff film&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt; — is almost here, and a new full-length trailer shows off a lot more of the epic monster fighting and charismatic heroics of its protagonist, Geralt’s mentor Vesemir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CY4Gwt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Witcher’s anime spinoff keeps the bathtub, but adds a fun-loving lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SEuVYJ"&gt;The film is set before the events of the live-action series and will look to explain more about the Witcher’s world, including how the magically mutated monster hunters are created. It’ll also provide useful backstory on Vesemir, who’s set to appear in the upcoming second season of the show when it arrives this December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnCqZR"&gt;The new trailer for the anime spinoff also shows off a lot more of the expanded &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, and some rather impressive-looking fight scenes and effects, the sorts of which would have been far harder to achieve in the live-action series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZtuvO"&gt;Kwang Il Han, director at Studio Mir, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22602293/witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-anime-spinoff-netflix-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one benefit of the animated format included allowing the witchers to carry &lt;a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_steel_swords"&gt;their iconic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_sword"&gt;dual blades&lt;/a&gt;: “The actors had difficulty carrying multiple swords at the same time, because they were too heavy, so they were only carrying one sword at a time,” he says. “In the anime we don’t have those restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgazJY"&gt;The new trailer follows a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZANFe4zS-yk"&gt;shorter teaser&lt;/a&gt; released last month and comes just a few weeks before the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569957/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-netflix-release-date-trailer"&gt;August 23rd debut&lt;/a&gt; of the animated film. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Midnight Mass is the next horror series from the mind behind Haunting of Hill House</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Midnight Mass" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-aAb3inL0QTbcXvn759u2_Dp6oQ=/281x0:3320x2026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699551/MMASS_102_Unit_04484RC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eike Schroter/Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sr4AU5"&gt;The mind behind one of Netflix’s most unsettling shows is back with a new series. &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is a new seven-episode show from Mike Flanagan, perhaps best-known as the creator of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and its follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And while the new series — which stars the likes of Rahul Kohli, Zach Gilford, and Hamish Linklater — isn’t part of that anthology, the first trailer has some very similar, and creepy, vibes. Check it out above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvWeUV"&gt;Here’s the basic premise, from Netflix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SX1Y32"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; tells the tale of a small, isolated island community whose existing divisions are amplified by the return of a disgraced young man (Zach Gilford) and the arrival of a charismatic priest (Hamish Linklater). When Father Paul’s appearance on Crockett Island coincides with unexplained and seemingly miraculous events, a renewed religious fervor takes hold of the community: but do these miracles come at a price?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VUMVIZ"&gt;The good news is that horror fans won’t have to wait all that long to binge Flanagan’s latest: &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; hits Netflix on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson’s custom electric chopper is up for auction, and I must have it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-RUDh6ACTV9B0alApgXQy2n7Q48=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699414/MOSH_CHOP_Left_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2A6oEm"&gt;Serial 1, the electric bike company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;spun out from Harley-Davidson last year&lt;/a&gt;, is making one-of-a-kind, custom-built e-bikes and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.serial1.com%2Fproduct%2Fmosh-chopper%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616558%2Fharley-davidson-seral-1-electric-chopper-auction-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctioning them off online&lt;/a&gt;. The first one is the Schwinn Sting-Ray-inspired Mosh/Chopper, which the company describes as a “psychedelic, hand-painted banana seater,” and oh boy do I want it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBZvq7"&gt;Unfortunately, my chances are slim to none. First of all, Serial 1 is only making, well, one of these. The Mosh/Chopper is the first product from the company’s new 1-OFF series, in which it’s custom designing, building, and releasing single-edition (i.e. runs of just one) e-bikes throughout the year and auctioning them off online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d9kyfN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I desperately want to put baseball cards in its spokes and attach streamers to the handlebars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k58I6o"&gt;The current bid is $6,700, which is a bit too expensive for my taste. The auction ends August 11th at 5PM, so there isn’t much time left to bid. Whoever ends up winning, please let me borrow it for a little while. I desperately want to put baseball cards in its spokes and attach streamers to the handlebars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r5t44N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10692985"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zjyBd"&gt;To be honest, I didn’t grow up in the 1960s, so I never owned a Sting-Ray, but damn if this isn’t a gorgeous homage to the cruisers of that era. Serial 1 unveiled the Mosh/Chopper at the 81st annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally last week, a sign that the company will be leaning into its motorcycle roots in future projects. Also, the bike was constructed by two Milwaukee-based chopper builders, Warren Heir Jr. and Kendall Lutchman of JR’s Fabrication and Welding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rMa3u"&gt;“Customization is such an important part of the motorcycle ownership experience,” says Aaron Frank, brand director at Serial 1, in a statement. “For decades, people have been modifying their motorcycles to reflect their unique style and taste. The 1-OFF Series applies this same spirit of individualization and personalization to eBikes, showing people just how much fun it is to create an eBike that suits their own unique personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tffyDA"&gt;The Mosh/Chopper isn’t just a beautiful e-bike; it’s also packing a powerful drivetrain, thanks to Harley-Davidson’s design know-how and a bunch of well-sourced components. Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;Serial 1’s regular lineup of e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, the Chopper has a Gates Carbon Drive belt, a German-made Brose mid-drive motor that’s capable of 250W of continuous power and hitting top speeds of 20mph. On top of that, the bike has hydraulic disc brakes, internally routed cables and wires, and integrated lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kd5FPG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/583613796?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oIyH9j"&gt;In addition, the Chopper is sporting many customized features: a long-and-low banana seat that’s supported by a custom stainless-steel sissy bar, and a high-rise handlebar that creates a comfortable riding position for laid-back cruising. The ‘60s-era “Street Freak” paint job, consisting of a silver micro-flake base coat covered in House of Kolor “oriental blue kandy,” is sure to look stunning under sunlight. And other finishings, like intricate panels, freak drops, hand-painted pinstripes, and single-stroke hand lettering, complete the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSVl6l"&gt;So once again, if you happen to submit the winning bid for this bike, my email address is andrew.hawkins@theverge.com. Please reach out. I know I will never own it, but maybe I can ride it once. Just around the block?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNwiDr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahDTYY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eZr84"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="se9vaK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft brings xCloud to Windows PCs with the Xbox app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GvJkA9NX53iLifyFpVGGKp-EVU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699406/xcloudwindowsxboxapp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SrHdvc"&gt;Microsoft is bringing xCloud to Windows PCs through its Xbox app today. Xbox Insiders will be able to access a new updated Xbox app with Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) built in. Much like how xCloud works through the web, you’ll just need a compatible controller connected via Bluetooth or USB to access Xbox games from a Windows 10 PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHA5Xy"&gt;The updated Xbox app will include a new “cloud games” section, with access to all of the same games available on xCloud on the web. “We’ve also added some new features to help you get started, including easy-to-access information on controller and network status, social features to stay connected with friends, and the ability to invite people – even those also playing on cloud without the game installed – to join you in a game,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/09/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-available-for-insiders-through-the-xbox-app-for-windows/"&gt;says Jason Beaumont&lt;/a&gt;, a partner director of Xbox experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jHv7jdq8X0xtuKRvhYi8gSPYmBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771357/p0O0qaM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;xCloud inside the new Xbox app on Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="af4Abt"&gt;Xbox Insider testers will be able to access the new Xbox app in 22 different countries through signing up to the “Windows Gaming” preview in the Xbox Insider Hub app. Cloud games will then be available in the Game Pass section of the app, allowing you to resume Xbox games that were started on a console or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Wj96"&gt;This new Xbox app also includes the ability to stream games from a local Xbox, allowing you to power on and off a console and play your games streamed from your own Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJeUgB"&gt;If you’re not an Xbox tester, you can still access xCloud over at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox.com%2Fplay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616774%2Fmicrosoft-xcloud-windows-xbox-app-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;http://xbox.com/play&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft will likely bring this full experience to the Xbox app on Windows in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung billionaire heir Jay Y. Lee gets parole, will be released from prison Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Heir Jay Y. Lee Appears At Court For Corruption Retrial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzcK8br-dWEWQu4zyy2L_htcTMY=/0x0:4946x3297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699010/1284664319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jay Y. Lee, head of Samsung will be released from prison August 13th | Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Azun60"&gt;Samsung vice chairman Lee Jae-yong —known in the West as Jay Y. Lee— will be released from prison Friday after South Korea’s justice ministry granted him parole, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3857903c-ed62-4203-8c32-eba0340b2bee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The billionaire heir to the Samsung empire, Lee, 53, had served six months of a 30-month prison sentence for offering bribes to South Korea’s former president Park Geun-hye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN5iDH"&gt;Lee was first sent to prison in 2017 in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14867124/samsung-bribery-corruption-trial-chairman-lee-jae-yong"&gt;succession scandal&lt;/a&gt; that led to Park’s removal. He was accused of offering payments and horses as bribes to a friend of the former president to try to garner support for his succession at Samsung. Lee served just one year of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16201360/samsung-lee-jae-yong-guilty"&gt;five-year sentence&lt;/a&gt; before a retrial was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/south-korea-orders-retrial-of-samsung-s-lee-in-bribery-scandal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ordered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. He was ordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236716/samsung-lee-jae-yong-prison-bribery-ruling"&gt;back to prison in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRtxlX"&gt;In December, Lee offered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249040/jay-y-lee-apology-samsung-heir-bribery"&gt;rare public apology&lt;/a&gt; for the succession plot. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-09/samsung-s-lee-receives-parole-after-jail-sentence-for-bribery?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Justice Minister Park Beom-kye said Monday that Lee’s “attitude during incarceration,” along with public sentiment and the economic impact of COVID-19 were all factors in the decision to grant Lee’s parole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4HtvQ"&gt;That public opinion includes recent polls that show South Koreans mostly favored Lee’s release from prison, as did business leaders and members of President Moon Jae-in’s government, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-south-korea-4d91344be72d7e3ed81625b0d769c0d0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Moon has not commented on Lee’s release, but his office has said such a decision would be up to the justice ministry. Moon’s party is working to build support ahead of presidential elections in March, and Lee’s release is expected to work in his favor; as one political consultant told the &lt;em&gt;AP,&lt;/em&gt; some 5 million South Koreans own shares in Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz1wrF"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jay-y-lee-samsungs-de-facto-leader-wins-parole-from-prison-11628503884"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unclear how Lee, the grandson of Samsung’s founder, will be able to resume his work at the company once he’s released: South Korean law imposes a five-year employment ban on people who commit economic crimes, and people on parole are restricted from traveling overseas. Lee would need to seek an exemption from the employment restriction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iAiuO"&gt;And following his release, Lee still could face jail time again, in a case involving a $3.9 billion accounting fraud at a Samsung subsidiary. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports Lee could also face charges for allegedly abusing the sedative propofol. Lee has denied all charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4i3bz"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;Samsung released its second-quarter earnings&lt;/a&gt;, which showed a 20 percent uptick in revenue and a 54 percent increase in operating profit from the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vodafone latest UK carrier to reintroduce roaming charges in Europe after Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Masked customers queue to enter Vodafone Mobile Phone Store..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xzuy64efwhZV1QK-OQVpuhOlVa8=/0x164:5000x3497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698853/1234410114.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael McNerney/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZNzbEa"&gt;Vodafone has announced it will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reintroduce roaming charges&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for UK mobile customers from January next year. It’s the latest UK carrier to reintroduce the fees after the country’s departure from the European Union, and it follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548668/ee-uk-carrier-roaming-charges-european-union"&gt;similar U-turn from EE&lt;/a&gt; in June. All major carriers in the country &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/major-uk-mobile-networks-vow-not-reintroduce-roaming-charges/"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; they had no plans to introduce roaming fees in Europe after the Brexit vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glGRZq"&gt;The fees will apply to any Vodafone customers who sign up to or change their contract from August 11th, 2021, with the fees applying from January 6th, 2022. Costs are dependent on the specific plan, but most customers will pay £2 ($2.77) a day to use their UK allowance of calls, texts, and data in Europe, or £1 a day if access is bought in eight- or 15-day bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ohPej"&gt;Customers signed up to Vodafone’s “Unlimited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” or “Limited Data Xtra plan with 4 Xtra benefits” will pay no extra fee to use their UK allowance in Europe. All UK Vodafone customers traveling to the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will not have to pay any roaming fees regardless of their contract. Full details of the new payment plans can be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%2Froamingupdate22&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616543%2Fvodafone-europe-roaming-charges-price-tariff-brexit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ti7lO"&gt;Roaming charges were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;abolished in the European Union&lt;/a&gt; on June 15th, 2017, but after the UK voted to leave the EU, it had to renegotiate its trade agreements with the bloc. These did not include free mobile roaming, allowing UK carriers to reintroduce fees if they wished. &lt;/p&gt;
