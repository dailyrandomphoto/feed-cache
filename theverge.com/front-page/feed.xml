    <title>Go read this look at how Clubhouse’s blocking system is problematic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Clubhouse logo is seen on a smartphone screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vSBa-42nkkLrr3HsumM29jx2uG8=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292986/1232816107.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lRKsUn"&gt;Anyone who’s spent more than five minutes on social media can tell you that most platforms have plenty of trolls, reply-guys and other people who may just be unpleasant to interact with. On big platforms like Twitter, Faecbook, and Instagram, the option to block another user allows you to keep someone out of your feed. Blocking is far from a perfect solution, but at least it gives users a way to continue to use the platforms and avoid (some) nasty interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsBh1h"&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Will Oremus writes for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the year-old audio chat platform Clubhouse has a different mechanism for blocking, one that affects more than just the blocker and the blockee (I know, but what would you call it?): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ugrqj0"&gt;When you block someone on Clubhouse, it doesn’t just affect communications between the two of you, as it would on Facebook or Twitter. Rather, it limits the way that person can communicate with others too. Once blocked, they can’t join or even see any room that you create, or in which you are speaking—which effectively blocks them for everyone else in that room. If you’re brought “onstage” from the audience to speak, anyone else in the audience whom you have blocked will be kept off the stage for as long as you’re up there. And if you’re a moderator of a room, you can block a speaker and boot them from the conversation in real time—even if they’re mid-sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xLO8ce"&gt;So in essence, a “black badge” on Clubhouse can limit who speaks, where, and when on the platform. As Oremus notes, it’s a social act to block another person on Clubhouse, one that affects multiple interactions. And members of underrepresented groups said that blocking can be “weaponized” on Clubhouse, to squelch certain points of view or restrict conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MelgiJ"&gt;One, a Black woman in her 20s who’s studying medicine, said she has been barred from rooms discussing vaccination in Black communities, because one influential anti-vaxxer who frequents those rooms blocked her. She also found herself abruptly shut out of a weekly &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; watch-party club that had become her favorite experience on the app, evidently because one member had blocked her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LdPKni"&gt;The buzz around Clubhouse— which attracted 10 million users in its inaugural year— has &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over"&gt;started to fizzle out&lt;/a&gt; a bit; it only recently released a version for Android devices, and new users can only join when invited by a current user. Add to that the rising popularity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;superior accessibility of Twitter’s audio chat platform Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems Clubhouse may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Go read this analysis&lt;/a&gt; of why its unusual blocking system may ultimately contribute to the platform’s decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovrSQZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline says operations back to normal following ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Atlantic Gasoline Flows Surge On Colonial Spill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06OaLnSDtg4VorIrGoec8nZJvJg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292718/608064472.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeagMe"&gt;Colonial Pipeline said Saturday that all of its systems are back to operating normally, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;pipeline it shut down a week ago&lt;/a&gt; amid a ransomware attack. The pipeline is now servicing all its markets including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, DC, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, the company tweeted. Colonial carries 45 percent of the fuel supplies for the eastern United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YprrWR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we previously reported, Colonial Pipeline initiated the restart of pipeline operations at approximately 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 12. Since that time, we have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the markets we serve. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UJG7SqUxSQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UJG7SqUxSQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Colonial Pipeline (@Colpipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529174598504454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbuwkZ"&gt;The company reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a $5 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; to DarkSide, the group responsible for the incident. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;DarkSide has since apologized&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences” of the attack, which included fuel shortages in many of the markets that the 5,500-mile-long pipeline services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifimv3"&gt;It remains unclear which parts of the Colonial Pipeline were at risk, but a company spokesperson suggested it did not appear that the company’s operational systems were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rs8Q6F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The cybersecurity ‘pandemic’ that led to the Colonial Pipeline disaster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429433/colonial-pipeline-cyber-security-ransomware-attack"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LiAURW"&gt;Colonial &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529184174198787"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it has invested “meaningfully” in its IT and cybersecurity, and said it would “continue to put safety and system integrity first.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z64CK8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Since this incident began, we have been clear that our focus was on the safe and efficient restoration of service to our pipeline system. That is what we have achieved through the commitment and dedication of the many Colonial team members.&lt;/p&gt;— Colonial Pipeline (@Colpipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529181447852032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yd4uNR"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/15/colonial-pipeline-resumes-normal-operations-after-hack.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC,&lt;/em&gt; there are still fuel shortages&lt;/a&gt; in many of the markets the affected pipeline serves; it reported 80 percent of gas stations in Washington, DC were still without fuel as of Saturday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOFbLz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is reportedly continuing a ban on anti-coup groups in Myanmar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWuyZsTB73Jql1G3uPp3vwWD6rA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292441/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3amtd"&gt;Facebook has reportedly upheld a ban on many organizations in Myanmar that have joined forces to resist the military coup that occurred back in February, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-is-still-censoring-groups-fighting-the-military-coup-in-myanmar/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bans were put in place back in 2019, when organizations like the Arakan Army, and many of its allies, were classified as terrorist organizations by the democratically-elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE5Jnd"&gt;Things have changed in Myanmar since then. After the military coup and government takeover by the Tatmadaw (carried out after an election which &lt;a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/election-fraud-01282021184631.html"&gt;the military claims was fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;), the political situation has become extremely complex. There is, however, one thing that is seemingly clear: the Arakan Army is no longer classified as a terrorist organization, either by the &lt;a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-military-regime-removes-arakan-army-list-terrorist-groups.html"&gt;current military-led government&lt;/a&gt;, or by the &lt;a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/myanmar-military-not-eaos-only-terrorist-organisation-in-myanmar-crph-says"&gt;elected government currently in exile&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the Arakan Army is still not allowed on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy9M8F"&gt;The AA isn’t the only group that’s found itself unable to communicate through Facebook. There are apparently many ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) active in the country, some of which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22412118/myanmar-coup-protesters-rohingya"&gt;have banded together as a resistance&lt;/a&gt; to the coup government, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/13/22329081/myanmar-protests-killed-casualties"&gt;violently cracking down on pro-democracy protestors&lt;/a&gt;. Many of their Facebook pages were also restricted back in 2019, under orders of the democratically elected government, which has since been overthrown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLgycN"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the ban of EAOs was controversial before the coup as well: some argue that it prevented the spread of information about human rights violations, like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41566561"&gt;the genocide against the Rohingya Muslims&lt;/a&gt; carried out by the Tatmadaw. Now, EAOs and journalists in the country argue that Facebook’s bans prevent them from showing what’s happening in the struggle against the current military government. The director of a human rights organization told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the bans are “like trying to close the people’s eyes and ears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdlxGy"&gt;Facebook also &lt;a href="https://time.com/5943151/facebook-myanmar-military-ban/"&gt;banned pages associated with the Tatmadaw&lt;/a&gt; following the coup, but human rights activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi tells &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the company has still failed to react to the political changes that have occurred in Myanmar since then, and called on the company to create an official oversight board for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be working on Twitter Blue, a subscription service that would cost $2.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrXZxW9zkRnSgMqroLciklrDtY4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292410/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IV4i7C"&gt;Twitter has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;confirmed that it’s exploring&lt;/a&gt; a paid subscription model for some features, and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted Saturday that she’s discovered how much it will cost and what it will be called. Twitter Blue, Wong says, will cost $2.99 per month, and will include an Undo Tweets feature and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393287285156859911?s=20"&gt;bookmark collections&lt;/a&gt;. Wong says it appears Twitter is working on a tiered subscription model, which she posits could mean a less-cluttered, premium experience for the highest-paying subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zgZgW2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is calling their upcoming Subscription Service “Twitter Blue”, priced at $2.99/month for now, including paid features like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undo Tweets: &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH"&gt;https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collections: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o"&gt;https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yyMStpCkpr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yyMStpCkpr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2u2xPw"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment Saturday, but the company doesn’t usually confirm or otherwise comment on Wong’s typically accurate discoveries of new features before they launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqIiMQ"&gt;Twitter has made a slew of new product announcements over the past several weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420586/twitter-offensive-tweet-warning-prompt-updated-success-rate"&gt;updating its warnings&lt;/a&gt; for potentially offensive tweets, improving its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;photo cropping algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to allow “taller” images to fully display in users’ feeds, adding the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434936/twitter-dm-search-android-expanding"&gt;Android users to search&lt;/a&gt; their direct messages, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;rolling out a Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; to allow users to make donations to some creators, journalists, experts, and non-profits (although that last one raised some &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx55k4/psa-twitters-new-tip-jar-can-reveal-your-address"&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; about what user information is included along with the tip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5d9SP"&gt;And earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;Twitter acquired Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, the $5-per-month subscription service that removes ads from websites that participate. With the Scroll announcement, Twitter also said it would be winding down Nuzzel, a Scroll service that sent users daily email roundups of top stories in their Twitter feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PkuKt"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393639463746641923?s=20"&gt;Wong noted&lt;/a&gt; in a later tweet, Tony Haile, the former CEO of Scroll who is now on the product team at Twitter, tweeted the day his company was acquired that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arctictony/status/1389565785555836929?s=20"&gt;Scroll would “integrate into a broader Twitter subscription later in the year.”&lt;/a&gt; That would seem to suggest that one of the offerings of a premium Twitter product would be an ad-free experience, something it seems diehard tweeters have asked for almost as much as editable tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46o8Eb"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;first-quarter earnings report&lt;/a&gt; late last month, Twitter had a profit of $68 million on revenue of $1.04 billion. The company reported a 20 percent increase in monetizable daily active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmgMo6"&gt;There’s no word  yet on when a premium paid version of Twitter would launch, or who would be eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0egjgi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 15th 3:09PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds that Twitter declined comment, and additional detail about Twitter’s acquisition of Scroll.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How far have you gone for internet access?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFMm-Tbdb1rhimDTY5fPzPBC8fU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292292/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONt52x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421637/infrastructure-week-broadband-hospitals-biden-plan-ev-charging"&gt;Infrastructure Week&lt;/a&gt; focused partly on how dire the broadband problem currently is for Americans. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;we showed you a map&lt;/a&gt; of the worst counties for broadband in the US — and on Friday, we closed the week by showing how satellite services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; aren’t enough to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeSTgq"&gt;But even for the people who do have high-speed internet access, many of them have done desperate things to secure access to it. Our team resides all around the US, and they’ve shared some personal tales below about their experiences getting (or failing to get) high-speed internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmPUzF"&gt;But we also want to know what lengths &lt;em&gt;you’ve&lt;/em&gt; gone to for internet access. Did you have to plead with an unwilling internet service provider to branch out its high-speed service to your area? Did you resort to using a device in an unintended way to get internet access? Did you use any clever workarounds to improve your internet (or piggy-back on a neighbor’s)? Share your story in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="akDgYb"&gt;
&lt;p id="3xIejD"&gt;When I came back from college one summer, I found my mom had switched from dial-up to slightly faster RF-based internet. There was a little dish on our back porch pointed at the grain elevators in town (the largest building in the area). The internet providers were just a couple of nice young dudes who were using cable lines to string internet from the center of town to the grain elevators where they would then beam it out to people too far away to get DSL or cable. The internet was usually fine but would slow down or stop altogether if there was interference. Usually, it was a bad storm or heavy fog. But the worst was whenever the hay fields between the grain elevators and my home were harvested. It would kick up dust and leave me totally internet-less. I got very comfortable playing &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; in coffee shops and diners in rural North Texas. &lt;strong&gt;— Alex Cranz, managing editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jxvtcm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K5vNY2"&gt;The internet at my parents’ house (where I’ve spent a good amount of the pandemic working, since my 200-square-foot apartment isn’t an ideal office) is mind-bogglingly slow. This is a problem for me as someone who reviews laptops, and especially gaming laptops, because I constantly need to download things. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;took almost four days to load onto my drive on my parents’ internet, for example, and it was bogging everything else down so much that I needed to find another solution. So I want to take this space to shout out the Congregational Church of Salisbury, which has allowed me to absolutely pummel their holy internet with piles of heavy downloads several times this year. There’s no experience more serene than spending the morning in an empty chapel, hearing the chirps of birds echo through windows and across the pews, feeling at peace with nature and God, as you download AAA game after AAA game. &lt;strong&gt;— Monica Chin, writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmY0SZ"&gt;Back in the days when getting access to data internationally cost a small fortune, a friend of mine came up with the ingenious workaround of using the free 3G connection on his Kindle as a workaround. He spent an entire summer using the basic browser built into his e-reader to load up Google Maps and find his way around. It was a painful process, and I don’t think he got anywhere particularly quickly, but it was better than having to pay the international roaming rates being charged at the time. &lt;strong&gt;— Jon Porter, news reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJOX2h"&gt;Being a freelance video professional and needing to upload large files means my internet connection can be the difference between spending a day to get a video online or a few minutes. Unfortunately, living in NYC means I pretty much only have one option for internet from the legacy cable provider (Spectrum). Like most cable providers, they offer decent download speeds but throttle the upload speeds to the same measly 30mbps across all their plans, and even then you rarely get the full 30mbps. I wanted fiber internet because it offers modern bandwidth for uploads, but there was little incentive for Verizon FiOS to run their service into the pre-war building I live in on the Upper West Side. I was determined, though, and went door to door to every resident in the building to get enough signatures showing interest in having a fiber option for internet. After getting a majority of the tenants to sign on and calling and writing to Verizon every week for almost six months, I was able to get them to coordinate with the landlord to install service to our building. Now an average video that would take several hours to upload can be put online in a few minutes. Being able to fix a problem or make a quick change to a video for a client allows me to accommodate client requests that many other producers would not be able to handle. My upload speed can be the real difference between getting the next job or not.  &lt;strong&gt;— Liam James, producer on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVf6CF"&gt;I was studying in mainland China during a big crackdown on US websites in college. So I spent half the year playing a constant game of whack-a-mole with Tor and a series of sketchy (but faster) free web proxies whose names and links got passed around my cohort like we were sharing the passwords to a speakeasy. I’m lucky I didn’t end up with some kind of horrific malware, but on the bright side, it’s the only time I could imagine feeling cool and rebellious visiting Facebook. &lt;strong&gt;— Adi Robertson, senior reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SjVIP"&gt;My family didn’t upgrade from dial-up until around 2012, which meant that we also didn’t have Wi-Fi. Of course, I wasn’t going to let that stop me from getting Online, so I did what any preteen would do: grabbed my PSP 2000 and roamed around my neighborhood looking for unprotected hotspots. I ended up finding one right by our house (hi neighbors!), and eagerly connected to it. Thankfully, there was a tree in the exact perfect spot, where I was as close to their property as I could’ve been without technically trespassing. That unprotected Wi-Fi hotspot and my PSP’s web browser were my main access to the internet for about a year — I would hang in, on, or around the tree, surfing the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aoHSt"&gt;I realize that this may mean I was one of the PSP web browser’s top users, and I know I had a few JavaScript bookmarklets installed, though I don’t remember what they did. I know that most of what I was doing were the types of things I didn’t want to or couldn’t do on the public desktop: setting up a secret MySpace account to talk to my fake middle school girlfriend and playing multiplayer games (though I usually couldn’t finish them, as the connection was, understandably, super flaky). &lt;strong&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEAN3F"&gt;Dial-up internet was the only option during my teenage years living on the outskirts of a small town in Ohio. We got service through CompuServe, and it showed its limitations when I needed to do pretty much anything other than using MySpace, Xanga, or GameFaqs for text-only gaming guides. I remember it took a week to download a 63MB trailer for &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&lt;/em&gt; on Kazaa. So, it was totally inadequate for playing online games like &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox 360, which all of my friends were playing at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8tVc6"&gt;To get something that could even be considered high-speed internet at our house (I recall that speed being well under 500Kbps for download and upload speeds), I had to repeatedly call and plead with the local ISP to bring it out to where I lived, about 20 miles out of town. It eventually worked after a few months of persistence. I got my way, and I could &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;play synchronous multiplayer games online for the first time ever. Shortly thereafter, a stranger online in &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; told me he was going to come to my house and kill me, so I quit playing it entirely. &lt;strong&gt;— Cameron Faulkner, writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G78y9g"&gt;There are four rooms in my apartment. Living room —&amp;gt; Kitchen —&amp;gt; Bathroom —&amp;gt; Bedroom. Thick concrete walls between each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfcASv"&gt;My router is in the living room. It does not reliably reach the bedroom. If I leave the bedroom door all the way open, I might maintain a consistent signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnEEAT"&gt;I know I need to buy an Eero or something, but I keep thinking a better model will come out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnRd8B"&gt;So instead, I bought a $30 Wi-Fi repeater and a long extension cable. I ran the cable from a power outlet in the kitchen out into the hallway (there are no outlets in the hallway) that leads to the bedroom. The cable is somewhat tactfully hidden around a doorframe using a series of tiny nails meant for hanging picture frames and thread to hold the cable in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pL1ZS3"&gt;The Wi-Fi repeater is now hovering near the ceiling, halfway between the router and bedroom. If I connect to it, I can get AOL-grade speeds in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKLZxP"&gt;It’s been there for 12 months now. I never use it.&lt;strong&gt;— Jake Kastrenakes, senior editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRGovd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlEL4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG3k9M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0L2xuk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o52Wqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoltOU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden revokes Trump executive order that targeted Section 230</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV2gd3"&gt;President Biden on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/14/executive-order-on-the-revocation-of-certain-presidential-actions-and-technical-amendment/"&gt;revoked several of former President Trump’s executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, including one that would have changed legal protections for social media sites and other online platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMLIC8"&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act limits how much online platforms can be held liable for content users share on their platforms. The Trump order, titled “preventing online censorship,” would have allowed federal authorities to hold companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook responsible if they were found to be infringing on users’ speech by deleting or otherwise modifying users’ posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB5SPn"&gt;Trump signed the order last May, just as Twitter started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;applying labels to his tweets as “misleading.”&lt;/a&gt; Trump was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for tweets inciting the January 6th riot at the US Capitol. A similar ban by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;Facebook remains in effect&lt;/a&gt; while the company reevaluates it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X31hif"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s go through Trump’s terrible internet censorship order, line by line","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21273191/trump-twitter-social-media-censorship-executive-order-analysis-bias"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTdqd5"&gt;In addition to revoking the executive order that would have changed Section 230, Biden revoked a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-signs-executive-order-punish-vandalism-against-federal-monuments-n1232322"&gt;2020 Trump order&lt;/a&gt; that would have allowed the government to prosecute people who caused damage to statues or monuments, and put a halt to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/04/trump-garden-of-american-heroes-348761"&gt;Trump’s plan to create&lt;/a&gt; a National Garden of American Heroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5NJaj"&gt;President Biden also revoked a 2019 Trump order that would have &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-require-applicants-for-immigrant-visas-to-show-proof-of-health-coverage-11570228956?mod=article_inline"&gt;required immigrants to the US&lt;/a&gt; to prove they could afford healthcare as part of their visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine drives in the US are getting younger  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yyEvJx"&gt;This week, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22395472/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kid-ages-12-15-fda-authorization"&gt;authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people 12-15&lt;/a&gt;, a moment that many families have been eagerly waiting for since the vaccine rollout began in the US. As shots became available, parents &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-rush-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-for-their-children-11620984600"&gt;rushed to get their kids the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But the decision has also contributed to ongoing discussions about how to best distribute vaccines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUrG8H"&gt;In Santa Barbara, one 14-year-old got a &lt;a href="https://newspress.com/vaccines-for-teens/"&gt;vaccine for his birthday&lt;/a&gt;. In Colorado, schools are &lt;a href="https://co.chalkbeat.org/2021/5/13/22435327/covid-vaccine-teens-families-colorado-schools"&gt;setting up vaccine clinics&lt;/a&gt;. In Los Angeles, high-schoolers were eager for their shot at experiencing a normal life again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Bhn7OJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yO4Gd3"&gt;“I have a large family, one that I haven’t been able to see in over a year. I’ve missed out on being with my friends, spending time with family, going to school and so much more,” 15-year-old Malyna Trujillo &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-12/l-a-county-to-offer-covid-19-vaccines-to-younger-teens-thursday"&gt;said at a news conference&lt;/a&gt; in LA. “This vaccination isn’t just for me, it’s for my family — for my community.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BXYmM"&gt;On Wednesday, an advisory committee to the CDC endorsed the FDA’s decision, clearing the way for vaccinations to start in earnest. After the committee’s vote, Henry Bernstein, a member of the panel and a Professor of Pediatrics at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell said he was excited that younger people could now get the vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXUxjz"&gt;“This will provide protection for 12 to 15 year olds. It’ll decrease transmission within their families. It’ll contribute to community immunity, and it allows the kids to more safely go back to camps this summer, and back to in person school.” Bernstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CDteaD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve missed out on being with my friends, spending time with family, going to school and so much more,”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FyMEH"&gt;Not everyone was thrilled with the decision. “I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-urges-rich-countries-donate-shots-instead-vaccinating-children-2021-05-14/"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt;. He asked that countries donate vaccines to other countries instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndhnoJ"&gt;“In low and lower-middle income countries, Covid-19 vaccine supply has not been enough to even immunize healthcare workers, and hospitals are being inundated with people that need lifesaving care urgently,” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-57114734"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUhd7s"&gt;People on the CDC committee acknowledged the disparity in comments after the vote. “If we look at what’s happening elsewhere in the world, that’s evidence of what happens if you don’t have adequate supplies of safe and effective vaccines” said Matthew Daley, a pediatrician and researcher at Kaiser Permanente’s Institute for Health Research. “We’re in this very privileged position where we can see declining deaths and declining case rates because of these vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4NNYy8"&gt;Younger people are not at as great a risk of developing severe complications of COVID-19 as older people. But less risk is not zero risk, and as vaccinations have accelerated in the United States, doctors have seen &lt;a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/childrens-health/covid-upticks-among-kids-and-teens-what-parents-should-know"&gt;spikes in infections in unvaccinated children.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNlq7T"&gt;For parents, securing an early vaccine slot was a first chance to provide their kids a little bit more freedom after a year of caution. Kids were excited at the prospect of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/us/coronavirus-vaccine-children-ages-12-15.html"&gt;sleepovers, shopping&lt;/a&gt;, and anything that looks like pre-pandemic life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTgphd"&gt;“The reason why I got it was because I want to see my friend, which I haven’t seen for a while. We’ve only been able to call each other,” 13-year-old Evan Yaney told &lt;a href="https://www.wilx.com/2021/05/13/mid-michigan-teenagers-lining-up-for-covid-vaccines/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WILX&lt;/em&gt; in Lansing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ms5fQB"&gt;That loneliness is something that experts hope this next stage of the vaccine rollout might combat. At the meeting of the CDC’s advisory panel this week, Grace Lee, a Professor of Pediatrics at Stanford University pointed out that we still don’t know the long-term effects of this pandemic on younger age groups.  “I think sometimes we lose the importance of children and adolescents in the midst of a pandemic. There’s been such a focus on older adults in particular, I think that the childhood experience our kids have gone through will have long-lasting consequences that may extend across generations,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6emvr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to see my friend, which I haven’t seen for a while.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KW7Id4"&gt;It has been a brutally hard year for children, many of whom have been kept apart from friends and family, suffered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21366285/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-education-school-distance-learning-control-damage"&gt;educational setbacks&lt;/a&gt;, or witnessed trauma. For them, the chance to get a vaccine offers them hope — for themselves, and also for the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5ES9H"&gt;“I have been extremely careful throughout this whole thing,” 13-year-old Pia Andrade told &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/05/13/houston-area-teens-among-first-to-be-vaccinated-in-12-through-15-age-group/"&gt;Houston’s &lt;em&gt;KPRC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as she got vaccinated this week. “My principal actually died from COVID. He was perfectly fine and he got it and was hospitalized and he just died. I’ve seen the effects firsthand, and the more of us that get vaccinated, the better the world will be.”&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found it worked about as well as manual contact tracing methods, and calculated that it &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-google-contact-tracing-uk-1225935/"&gt;may have saved thousands of lives&lt;/a&gt;. They suggest that similar apps could be used in other countries to blunt the pandemic, while the world waits on vaccines. (Fraser et al, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

But they don’t always show the same symptoms as adults. In particular, they are much less likely to have a fever, making temperature screenings less effective at catching cases.

&lt;p id="TAN7XX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01246-x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How COVID broke the evidence pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;With more than a year of pandemic research under our belt, scientists are starting to take stock of the flood of COVID-19 related medical research. They’re finding that some of it...wasn’t that great. There were too many studies on individual (useless) drugs, studies with too few trial participants for any significant results, or review studies that quickly went out of date. There were major successes too, but scientists hope they can learn from the failures the next time an emergency crops up.  (Helen Pearson/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

But They Aren’t ‘Hesitant’ Either.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 30 million people in the US say they’d get a COVID-19 vaccine, but haven’t actually taken the plunge yet. Their reasons vary, but many in this group face hurdles like language barriers, difficult work schedules, or general lack of access.

A new paper showed that pregnant people can pass antibodies on to their fetus, and that breastmilk can pass antibodies along to infants. Another study found that the vaccine does not damage the placenta.  (Emily Anthes/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yCQQf3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="trV7c7"&gt;This week, the CDC changed its guidance for fully vaccinated people, saying that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;don’t have to wear masks&lt;/a&gt; in many settings. But masking won’t disappear overnight. Here are a few perspectives from people who are continuing to mask up, for a variety of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket suffers failure, loses payload of two satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--Mym7fCDgbkzOvOWe8kXL6l068=/11x0:1382x914/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292048/Screen_Shot_2021_05_15_at_9.42.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket launches from New Zealand on Saturday, as seen on the company’s live video feed. | Rocket Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RxHIoa"&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering an unexpected engine shutdown mid-flight on Saturday, losing the mission’s payload of two satellites, the company said. The launch from New Zealand was Electron’s 20th, and marked the company’s second mission failure in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aATXd1"&gt;Electron, a roughly six-story tall rocket with two booster stages, lifted off from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand at 7:11AM ET on Saturday, aiming to send a pair of Earth observation satellites for BlackSky into orbit. Two and a half minutes into flight, the rocket’s second stage booster successfully separated from its first stage and ignited for a few seconds before shutting down, indicating a problem as seen on the company’s launch live stream. Mission control lost telemetry of the booster shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVjl45"&gt;“An issue was experienced during today’s launch, resulting in the loss of the mission,” Rocket Lab &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/1393531340188913665?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; after the failure. “We are deeply sorry to our launch customers BlackSky and Spaceflight. The issue occurred shortly after stage two ignition. More information will be provided as it becomes available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tj5Ods"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will learn from this, and we’ll be back on the pad again”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1EGUpD"&gt;A secondary objective for the mission, dubbed “Running Out Of Toes,” involved a test of some hardware upgrades meant to improve Electron’s reusability, including a new heat shield for the booster’s reentry. The rocket’s first stage booster successfully splashed down in the ocean under parachutes as planned after lofting the second stage toward space, Rocket Lab said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcnL8L"&gt;The company is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate the cause of Saturday’s issue to correct it for future missions, the statement said. “With multiple launch vehicles currently in production, Rocket Lab is prepared for a rapid return to flight as soon as investigations are complete and any required corrective actions are in place,” it said. No injuries or public damage were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZCtUH"&gt;“We will learn from this, and we’ll be back on the pad again,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in the statement. BlackSky, the launch customer, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlackSky_Inc/status/1393539335807397897?s=20"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; Rocket Lab’s statement, saying: “This is what we have received from Rocket Lab. We will continue to offer updates as we learn more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOsrWv"&gt;Electron’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/4/21313502/rocket-lab-electron-launch-failure-pics-or-it-didnt-happen"&gt;last failure&lt;/a&gt; occurred in July 2020, carrying and ultimately losing seven satellites after its second stage shut down early. Rocket Lab &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408378/rocket-lab-electron-return-to-flight-capella-space-sequoia-satellite#:~:text=But%20just%20a%20few%20minutes,and%20fell%20back%20to%20Earth."&gt;returned to flight&lt;/a&gt; two months later after pegging the failure on a faulty electrical connection, carrying on with six successful Electron missions thereafter. The company has launched 17 successful missions in all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitter policy that could temporarily censor every single one of your tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-C9MND0vH5SM4VNjNpiHNWe6xs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291957/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ay94xs"&gt;On Tuesday, a noted Palestinian-American journalist reporting live from protests near Jerusalem was suddenly and mysteriously silenced on Twitter — with every single tweet replaced by the message “@MariamBarghouti’s account is temporarily unavailable because it violates the Twitter Media Policy.” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident"&gt;It was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company quickly admitted, and her tweets were quickly restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMMZwe"&gt;But it turns out that one part of the incident was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a mistake. While Twitter may have taken action on this person’s account in error, there actually is one particular situation where Twitter reserves the right to make your tweets disappear. And — if you ask me — it’s super, super dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iOKPG7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ive been on twitter what feels like my entire life and ive never seen before what they're doing to this palestinian journalist's account &lt;a href="https://t.co/z6bSmLCvNn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/z6bSmLCvNn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Johnston (@caseyjohnston) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseyjohnston/status/1392235369614163976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7PWFPP"&gt;Twitter pointed me to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/help-twitter/tombstones2/mediapolicymobile4.png"&gt;this specific image&lt;/a&gt; as an example of the policy, which seems like it could date back as far as October 2017: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JyAqj48gYxN4TncpzBdws-JoS_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22516445/mediapolicymobile4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found references to this policy on Twitter’s site dating back to 2018, though you can see an October 2017 timestamp on this theoretical example.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8H1aVo"&gt;There, the “Requiring media or profile edits” policy reads: “If an account’s profile or media content is not compliant with our policies, we may make it temporarily unavailable and require that the violator edit the media or information in their profile to comply with our rules. We also explain which policy their profile or media content has violated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bnvzS"&gt;Or, in plain English, if your profile picture, header image, or other picture you post doesn’t meet Twitter’s standards, Twitter won’t just censor that image — it may censor your entire account until you fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7M9wR"&gt;Why would Twitter need to notify people about a bad image on every single tweet from an author, instead of just omitting the image and perhaps providing an explanation? Over the past several years, we’ve seen many, many instances of Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;choosing&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554013/twitter-flags-president-trumps-tweets-votes-counted-election-pennsylvania"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;warning labels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;nearby&lt;/a&gt; offensive and damaging content, labels that still allow people to easily view those tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAMZqu"&gt;When I raised this question, a Twitter spokesperson would only say that the policy is designed to “better inform folks on the actions taken by Twitter.” The company declined to say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbTRAL"&gt;The most generous explanation I can muster is that this is an old, antiquated policy that should have been retired long ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Scy2fG"&gt;Twitter also initially restricted Barghouti’s ability to tweet, retweet, follow and like for 12 hours, according to screenshots she provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not clear why her account was mistakenly censored to begin with; Twitter couldn’t immediately say whether it was a human action or an automated system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSqblk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will continue to require masks in its US retail stores </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhAl_w0FHoyVHyOw1lEddZEV8rE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69291913/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple will keep its mask mandate in place at its US retail stores | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWfcNW"&gt;Despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Apple will keep its mandatory mask policy in place at its US retail stores for the time being,&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-15/apple-stores-keep-mask-mandate-as-company-evaluates-measures?sref=10lNAhZ9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company informed stores that it is continuing to evaluate COVID-19-related health and safety measures, but that the policy requiring customers and employees at its Apple stores would stay in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6U0Bt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;CDC announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that people who had been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus could do away with wearing masks indoors and outdoors, and did not have to continue social distancing. There are some exceptions to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;CDC guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends people continue masking on public transit, airplanes, and trains, and in health care settings such as a doctor’s office. Immunocompromised people are advised to consult their healthcare professional before discontinuing masks, and someone who develops new COVID-19 symptoms should start wearing masks again to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLw1dp"&gt;Some retail stores across the US &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/05/14/mask-mandate-stores-change-fully-vaccinated-cdc-no-masks-indoors/5102169001/"&gt;began lifting their mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, with large companies including Walmart, Trader Joe’s, and Costco updating their policies. But Target and CVS were among the retailers who said they would keep their mask requirements in place as they assessed the CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tza6u7"&gt;In its stores that have reopened— some are open on a limited basis — Apple currently requires customers and store employees to wear masks, and provides masks for customers that don’t have their own. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbrowse%2Fstore%2Fplan_your_visit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F15%2F22437593%2Fapple-masks-retail-stores-covid-cdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The company’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; also says it requires temperature checks before anyone is allowed to enter an Apple store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1X63"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
