    <title>Zoom update delivers more emoji reactions and new annotation features </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKWrpIKZeM_3wHoQCFuxbBEuIMk=/121x0:1495x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163606/Emoji_Set_GIF.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s now a much greater range of emoji to react with.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nt0iPJ"&gt;This week’s &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059667111?_ga=2.82392468.323175728.1619014441-1917483163.1587296428"&gt;Zoom update&lt;/a&gt; includes a couple of quality of life improvements for anyone using its annotation or emoji reaction features, &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/updates-vanishing-pen-informacast-new-meeting-reactions-zoom-chat-management/"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Meeting participants can now use any emoji that was previously available in Zoom chat to react during a meeting, up from the six meager options that were available previously. These include emoji with different skin colors. Hosts can also restrict emoji reactions to the standard six, if they prefer, and for larger accounts the full emoji set must be manually enabled by admins or account owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9EUwl"&gt;The service’s annotation feature is also being enhanced. Anyone who’s used Zoom’s annotation feature to draw text on the presentation screen will know how annoying it quickly becomes when you have to erase each scribble before you can move on. Now, a new “Vanishing Pen” tool on Windows, macOS, and Linux allows annotations to automatically disappear within “a couple of seconds.” If you’re drawing annotations on an Android or iOS tablet, there’s a new auto-shape feature to turn them into straight lines, rectangles, and ovals. Combined, these should keep Zoom presentations looking neater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WtU-84zqwcqva8X0r8a7yfY9jNw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459599/Vanishing_Pen_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annotations with the Vanishing Pen disappear within a couple of seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DGsu6O"&gt;A year ago, as Zoom exploded in popularity, it was hard to talk about the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202584/zoom-security-privacy-issues-video-conferencing-software-coronavirus-demand-response"&gt;without mentioning the privacy and security issues&lt;/a&gt; that were plaguing it at the time. Its encryption &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201234/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-video-chats-meetings"&gt;wasn’t actually end-to-end&lt;/a&gt;, and its default settings led to a wave of so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21207260/zoombombing-crime-zoom-video-conference-hacking-pranks-doj-fbi"&gt;Zoombombings&lt;/a&gt;.” But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/3/21203720/zoom-backlash-apology-zoom-bombings-eric-yuan"&gt;in the year since&lt;/a&gt;, the company has rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535818/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-e2ee-security-privacy-video-conferencing"&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570302/zoom-security-temporarily-shut-down-suspend-meetings-stop-zoombombers"&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; for its biggest issues, and now here we are talking about new emoji reaction features. What a way to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the company’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big iPad, Mini LED: why Apple’s new iPad Pro display is better and brighter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/84SmiG_awBbaB7etdE6k2AxvGSg=/0x0:1668x1112/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163536/ipadprocrop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6EkwEH"&gt;Apple’s latest iPad Pro might look very similar to the model it’s replacing, but it contains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;several major upgrades on the inside&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got the same powerful, energy-efficient M1 chip as the latest MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and now the redesigned iMac. Cellular models have made the jump to 5G. The front-facing camera can zoom and pan to keep you in focus on video calls. But aside from the processor, the biggest technical leap is exclusive to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro: it’s what Apple calls the “Liquid Retina XDR,” a new display that adopts Mini LED backlighting to achieve higher brightness and greater contrast than any iPad (or Mac) that the company has ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNYMdt"&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can reach 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness — on par with the ultra-expensive Pro Display XDR — and portions of the screen can hit an eye-searing 1,600 nits when playing HDR content. That’s brighter than many 4K HDR TVs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLF1Xe"&gt;For comparison’s sake, the previous iPad Pro topped out at 600 nits. Full stop. These measurements also obliterate Apple’s Mac lineup. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can go up to 500 nits. The flashy 24-inch iMac introduced yesterday? Also 500 nits. Things move a little closer when you look at the iPhone 12 Pro’s OLED screen, which can hit a max brightness of 800 nits and 1,200 in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbvOqZ"&gt;But Apple isn’t yet ready to make the switch to OLED for its tablets, and the reasoning probably comes down to the brightness advantage of Mini LED — plus the company’s promise that this iPad Pro, with its fancy display, still has the standard 10-hour battery life that iPad users have come to expect. Either way, this is an upgrade that should be plainly evident to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="20XTTP"&gt;What is Mini LED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FRsI6s"&gt;Unlike OLED, where individual pixels are self-illuminating and can fully turn off when not needed, Mini LED is more of a natural progression from the LCD screens that have become such a mainstay of consumer electronics. But where this new approach differentiates itself is in the size and quantity of LEDs behind the screen. During its Spring Loaded event, Apple’s Heidi Delgado said that the previous iPad Pro had 72 LEDs, but the new “Liquid Retina XDR” manages to pack in over 10,000 of them. Apple accomplished this by miniaturizing the LEDs to a size “120 times smaller in volume than the previous design.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TynE4-W6Ht5SEGThE4vS914xSVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459379/MiniLED.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has over 10,000 LEDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9enWaW"&gt;The Mini LEDs are grouped into over 2,500 local dimming zones that can individually brighten and dim based on whatever’s being shown on the display. This granular level of control, according to Delgado, results in customers “seeing the brightest highlights along with subtle details in the darkest parts of an image.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UY5ocq8wXmPsr70iTw_OQ_biAp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459369/Zones.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dimming zones can light up and dim based on what’s on-screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lcvwE6"&gt;Apple isn’t first to Mini LED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BW7aSj"&gt;Though this might be the first time Mini LED has found its way into a tablet, the technology has already appeared in TVs. &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/blog/article/mini-led-technology"&gt;TCL really sparked the trend&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and apparently Samsung and LG took notice: their higher-end 2021 LCD TVs now utilize Mini LED backlighting as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aYqdAc47IEWfHdrjCihYfXLEjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459345/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.36.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A visualization of TCL’s Mini LED implementation on its TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FOPASo"&gt;Here’s how TCL explains the visual improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlVqsN"&gt;LED LCD TVs have two parts of the display that combine together to create an image. The “LCD” (liquid crystal display) part of the display creates a picture and the “LED” (light-emitting diode) part of the display makes light that shines through the picture so your eyes can see it. So the benefit of thousands of precisely controlled mini-LEDs in an active matrix backlight is more powerful light that is more smoothly distributed across the screen, more precisely controlled for sharp contrast and more effective in creating vividly saturated colors that dazzle the eye. Mini-LED simply delivers dramatically better picture performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iOxYD4"&gt;The huge uptick in LEDs could also result in improved panel uniformity; some owners of the previous 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uneven-backlight-on-11-ipad-pro.2154729/"&gt;have observed uneven backlighting&lt;/a&gt;. Having exchanged one or two for this very reason, I can vouch. The “panel lottery” is a thing with pretty much any device — TVs, laptops, tablets, etc. — but making the move to Mini LED should help with consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zn1jun"&gt;What’s this I hear about MicroLED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebps60"&gt;MicroLED is seen as the next major leap in TV display technology and the potential successor to OLED. It shares many of OLED’s best traits (like self-emissive LEDs), ups the brightness, and comes without most of the associated drawbacks since the technology is inorganic. But right now, MicroLED is extremely cost prohibitive and really only found in ultra-premium luxury TVs from Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4I43B"&gt;Final impressions on the new iPad Pro will need to wait until we get it in our hands. But as someone who uses the previous 12.9-inch model daily for productive and creative purposes, I’m very curious to see what Mini LED adds to the iPad experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZLNCx"&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet is getting a UI refresh next month with smarter meeting features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqqxuTTSK1z1KxluRqBqTS12So8=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163540/googlemeetnewui.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet’s new user interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZLbIv"&gt;Google is refreshing its Meet user interface next month for desktop and laptop users. The new Meet for web interface includes improvements to video feeds, how you view or present meetings, and the navigation bar. While some of Google’s changes are playing catch-up to what’s offered in Zoom or Microsoft Teams, they are much-needed additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbRoIh"&gt;If you’re fed up of seeing your own face during calls, you’ll soon be able to minimize or hide it entirely. New options will also include the ability to place your own video feed in a tile in the grid of meeting participants, or a floating picture that can be resized and repositioned. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leYGYyMH1lJi1ScV2VNUINZ4hUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459260/image001.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet will soon let you adjust your own video feed position.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u6o7e9"&gt;If you’re busy presenting, Google is also improving how content is pinned and unpinned. You’ll soon be able to quickly unpin a presentation tile, and it resizes into the same size as other participants so you can see more people on a call or figure out if people were impressed by your slick slide transitions. In the coming months, Google Meet will also let participants pin multiple video feeds during a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOjczX"&gt;One of the most useful changes is improvements to the bottom bar of meetings to put all controls in a single place. That means chat, attachments, and the participants list are all at the bottom so there’s more space to see people and whatever is being presented during a call. Google is also moving the end call button away from the camera and microphone buttons so you don’t accidentally leave a call instead of mute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioEb817hHVhc255jla0AqT3u99E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459261/image004.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet will improve webcam brightness and visibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CdCIZ7"&gt;Alongside these UI improvements, Google is bringing its low-light mode from Meet on mobile over to the web version. This feature will automatically adjust your webcam video to make you more visible if you’re in a dark room. It will also adjust your video if you have too much light blasting in from a window behind you on a sunny day. This light adjustment feature will be available to all Meet users on the web in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCSBre"&gt;Google Workspace (paid) subscribers will also get access to a new autozoom feature in Google Meet in the coming months. This AI-powered feature will follow you and position you squarely in front of your camera if you move around. Google is also adding video background replacement to Meet in the coming weeks, allowing you to pick between a classroom, a party, and a forest to replace your background. More video backgrounds will be available in the future, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawmakers propose ban on police buying access to Clearview AI and other data brokers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SENATE FINANCE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9lVcUnDVmRWCjFfay0FD7zLjvE=/0x0:4113x2742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163485/1232324755.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VsVAsZ"&gt;A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed banning police from buying access to user data from data brokers, including ones that “illegitimately obtained” their records — like, its sponsors say, the facial recognition service Clearview AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YySg5R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Fourth%20Amendment%20Is%20Not%20For%20Sale%20Act%20of%202021%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act&lt;/a&gt; is sponsored by a bipartisan group including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and 18 other members of the Senate. The bill would make law enforcement agencies obtain a court order before accessing people’s personal information through third-party brokers — companies that aggregate and sell information like &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-use-cellphone-location-data-for-immigration-enforcement-11581078600"&gt;detailed user location data&lt;/a&gt;, surreptitiously gathered from smartphone apps or other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKJ5cG"&gt;Wyden announced the bill last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354244/ron-wyden-fcc-nomination-section-230-trump-order-vergecast-interview"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, following reports that several government agencies had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303190/congress-data-smartphone-tracking-fbi-security-privacy"&gt;purchased citizens’ location data&lt;/a&gt; through a service named Venntel rather than obtaining it through a warrant. “There’s no reason information scavenged by data brokers should be treated differently than the same data held by your phone company or email provider,” Wyden said in a statement today. “This bill closes that legal loophole and ensures that the government can’t use its credit card to end-run the Fourth Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5DIUx"&gt;The bill also takes aim at services that scrape and repurpose social media data for tracking purposes. It bars paying for what it calls “illegitimately obtained information,” including information that was gathered through deception and hacking or in a way that’s inconsistent with the privacy policy of the platform where people posted it. &lt;a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Fourth%20Amendment%20Is%20Not%20For%20Sale%20Act%20of%202021%20One%20Pager.pdf"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, the sponsors say that would prohibit buying facial recognition services from Clearview AI, which trains its models on photographs that users posted on social networks. Currently, “Clearview AI uses these illicitly obtained photos to power a facial recognition service it sells to government agencies, which they can search without a court order,” the release says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pD4619"&gt;Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) introduced equivalent legislation in the House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the team behind Life is Strange: True Colors created its empathetic new lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ifpr2aMgz1hW9VYXVWhTy_4SpWQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163340/alex_additional_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x3M0ht"&gt;Early in development, before the team at Deck Nine Games had settled on a main character or even a story for the next &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; game, they knew the general theme they wanted to tackle. “We did know early on that we wanted to explore empathy,” says Felice Kuan, senior staff writer on &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors&lt;/em&gt;. “We were particularly interested in pushing that concept as far as we could.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0UdnY"&gt;The result was Alex Chen, a new protagonist who has the power to see, experience, and manipulate the emotions of those around her. At the outset of the game — which launches in September — Alex moves back home to live with her brother, who then dies in an accident. She’s forced to use her powers to find out exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEQyFO"&gt;“We were looking for a protagonist who would have some vulnerability around this topic; around empathy and around emotion,” says Kuan. “Somebody who had some growing to do, who maybe had a relationship with an emotion that wasn’t entirely healthy, that we could spend the course of the game exploring, giving her a path to greater self-acceptance and greater trust in her own abilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x9Guxd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Life is Strange is my favorite TV show of the year — except it’s a video game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up"},{"title":"Life is Strange 2 is an uncomfortable sequel that’s powerfully relevant","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003367/life-is-strange-2-season-review-xbox-ps4-pc-dontnod"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DR6qDc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; has become something of an anthology series. While all of the titles are choice-driven adventure games that play out like an interactive drama, each entry stars new characters with unique powers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up"&gt;The original game featured Max&lt;/a&gt;, who could rewind time, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003367/life-is-strange-2-season-review-xbox-ps4-pc-dontnod"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange 2&lt;/em&gt; starred a pair of brothers&lt;/a&gt;, one of whom had Force-like telekinetic abilities. According to Kuan, what connects all of these characters — including Alex — is how their powers reflect their lives and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QsKYVu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6CkzwVAr0M?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rlNd9"&gt;“The powers in &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; are a certain flavor of power, it’s not necessarily superheroes,” she says. “They’re all meditations on real experiences that regular people go through. So with Alex, her empathy is a supernatural version of something that many feel all the time. Because of that, the powers are used to solve problems but, just as importantly, are a way for the main character to explore their own past, what they’re dealing with right now, and to grow from there. We very, very much wanted to make sure that the plot of the story, and Alex’s own relationship with her power, were intertwined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81xlWU"&gt;Despite the supernatural abilities, the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; games have become notable for exploring serious, real-world issues with depth and tact; &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange 2, &lt;/em&gt;in particular, was a story defined in part by racism, made all the more powerful because players were active participants. While we don’t know all of the details yet, &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt;, which is the first game in the series to feature an Asian American lead, will similarly tackle difficult subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McY6Kb"&gt;This kind of interactive storytelling is something that was completely new to Erika Mori, the actress who plays Alex in &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt;. “I wasn’t very knowledgeable about games or narrative adventure games in general,” she says. “I got a very quick lesson in what this world was, and was — and still am — in awe that this genre exists and all of the different ways that it connects with players and allows immersive storytelling is really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbOvjn"&gt;We haven’t seen much of the game beyond a single trailer, but fans seem to already be connecting to Alex as a character, much as they’ve done with past &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; heroes. You don’t have to look too far to find some amazing fan art. Mori believes that one of the reasons the character is so relatable is because, despite her circumstances, she maintains an aura of hope and positivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YC98L8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s so nice to see that people already love her as much as we love her.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfxdhI"&gt;“It’s so nice to see that people already love her as much as we love her,” she explains. “Part of what makes Alex so endearing or relatable, at least for me, is that she doesn’t fall victim to seeing herself as a victim. There’s this buoyancy of hope that she carries with her, and given her past and the death of her brother, that doesn’t go away. She doesn’t let that part of herself be diminished. So I think that makes her very easy to love and to root for.” Kuan has a more straightforward answer for why Alex has struck such a cord already: “Her character design is just adorable and really appealing, and Erika is coming through a lot, even in the little bit that we’ve seen, so it all makes sense why she’s being so welcomed,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbVIQk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; launches on September 10th, and it comes at a particularly challenging time, with a frightening level of violence and harassment targeted at the Asian American community. The timing is coincidental — video games take years to develop — but Mori believes that “it’s always a good time” to have more diverse characters at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P29Yv2"&gt;“I remember growing up I didn’t see a lot of people who looked like me,” she says, “and what I think is really powerful about &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, and narrative adventure games, is that people of all backgrounds, all types of diversity, are able to find commonality and connection with the characters. I think that’s a testament to the strength of the teams that work on it, from Deck Nine to [publisher Square Enix]. I’m so delighted that we have an Asian American woman leading the charge on this game, especially now. My hope is that people will see that Alex’s ethnicity is probably the least interesting thing about her.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft removes Xbox Live Gold requirement for free-to-play games today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzkeT_8-ID-yXliU6NwdPwhqwTI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163080/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgVYZV"&gt;Microsoft is removing its requirement for an Xbox Live Gold subscription to play free-to-play multiplayer games today. The software maker has been testing this removal over the past few weeks, and now every Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X owner will be able to play free multiplayer games without Xbox Live Gold. Microsoft is also unlocking Xbox party chat and the Looking For Groups (LFG) feature as part of this rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFhCw3"&gt;The Xbox Live Gold changes mean popular games like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and many others will no longer require a subscription. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fgames%2Ffree-to-play&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395433%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-live-gold-free-multiplayer-games-party-chat" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;More than 50 games &lt;/a&gt;will now be free-to-play. The changes certainly make the $299 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;Xbox Series S console&lt;/a&gt; a lot more appealing as a device for free-to-play multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O96hlE"&gt;Microsoft’s removal of the Xbox Live Gold requirement came after the company was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;reverse a price hike&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox Live Gold subscriptions earlier this year. Microsoft had attempted to double the cost of a yearly Xbox Live Gold subscription, a move that didn’t go down well with Xbox fans. Microsoft quickly backtracked and offered to remove the paywall for free-to-play multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7zn1u"&gt;Now that Microsoft has also made Xbox party chat and LFG free to use, it leaves Xbox Live Gold in a weird spot. Xbox Live Gold also provides monthly free games to subscribers and discounts for the Microsoft Store, but most of its core features are now free to all modern Xbox owners. You’ll still need an Xbox Live Gold subscription for an Xbox 360, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T54uLj"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345276/microsoft-xbox-live-network-rebrand-name-change"&gt;dropping Xbox Live branding&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the set of software and services as simply the Xbox network now. The company has also been convincing its loyal base of Xbox Live Gold subscribers to migrate over to Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service with more than 100 games that is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;Microsoft’s main focus for its plans for gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s Quibi content has a new, original name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXGT8N-WyjnPO3I9tiPQIajMNo0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69162965/akrales_190422_3301_0198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1MzNnM"&gt;Roku is officially getting into original content. The set-top box maker announced Roku Originals, a new brand, in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210421005270/en/Roku-Unveils-%E2%80%9CRoku-Originals%E2%80%9D-Brand-Bringing-Bold-Fresh-Entertainment-to-The-Roku-Channel/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; today. Roku says it will debut over 75 original series and films this year on its free, ad-supported network, The Roku Channel. Quite a few of these original new shows will come from the Quibi library of content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;Roku got in a fire sale in January 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vOqzS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285819/roku-original-content-job-listing-plan-original-shows-movies"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spied a job listing that suggested Roku would be investing in original content beyond the Quibi stuff it now owns. Free, ad-supported content is still a relatively new but growing area in streaming. Peacock, Paramount Plus, and even Plex have all had some success wooing viewers with totally free stuff they can watch on their set-top boxes and smart TVs. It makes sense that Roku, a company that makes the bulk of its money from ads already, would follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="purple text saying Roku Originals" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_--x06s1KCnsxXE8UmBwWIJh_10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459357/Roku_Originals_Logo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The very original new brand for original content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g0WvOV"&gt;There’s no word on which content will be released first or when it will even begin airing, but it's likely you’ll see the old Quibi content before any of Roku’s other original programming. That content is full of big names like Anna Kendrick, Idris Elba, and Liam Hemsworth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJXPyt"&gt;What will be interesting is how the Quibi content airs. Quibi’s gimmick (which was absolutely bizarre but also totally ahead of its time) was that content would change depending on how you held your phone, with separate and sometimes totally different streams provided for portrait and landscape mode. For example, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/quibi-is-either-a-clever-gimmick-or-the-future-of-enter-1840876439"&gt;in the short film &lt;em&gt;Nest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, holding the phone in landscape mode shows you the point of view of the main character, while holding it in portrait mode shows you the point of view of the Nest security cameras in the home the character is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKtm3b"&gt;Presumably, Roku will just be providing one stream: the landscape one. In some cases, that might actually affect how the story is presented or could even remove crucial context from a scene meant to be viewed in portrait mode on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Rc0Ws"&gt;All of the new Roku Originals will air on The Roku Channel, alongside old episodes of &lt;em&gt;This Old House&lt;/em&gt; and over 40,000 free movies and TV shows Roku has paid to license. Besides being playable on Roku devices, you’ll be able to tune into via your browser, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, and some Samsung smart TVs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trans streamers are creating the visibility Twitch won’t give them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6R_HBgKjuQ8FMqXlDW0Q6uo9zKg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69162947/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKRJ7O"&gt;“Identity shapes what we want to share and what we want to broadcast, [so] it is part of our content,” says Yana Calou, PR director of Trans Lifeline. The nonprofit operates a peer support and crisis hotline and offers microgrants to trans and nonbinary recipients. More recently, it launched &lt;a href="https://peer2peer.live/"&gt;a streaming discovery tool called Peer2Peer&lt;/a&gt; that functions as a searchable directory. Broadcasters can tag themselves in categories like “trans,” “Black,” or “lesbian,” and viewers can search for the tags they want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1NSCJ"&gt;With Twitch reluctant to allow identity-based tagging, marginalized viewers’ ability to find streamers and associated communities of people like them has been limited. But when a group of streamers approached Trans Lifeline about hosting the website they had created to facilitate these connections, Calou says they thought it was “a wonderful idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y620uw"&gt;“Having [an identity-based] tagging system that users consent to provides both streamers and viewers with the ability to have an experience that brings them comfort and connection and joy,” says Calou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxNePE"&gt;Project lead and creative director Steph Loehr saw the demand for this kind of service across years of Twitch streaming herself. “Identity-based tagging is invaluable,” she says. “Streamers of vulnerable minority communities are doing literal lifesaving work on Twitch every day by providing safe communities for others like them.” Front-end developer Lucia Everblack has similar experience. “It really is life changing and potentially even life saving because we’re giving people a direct route to talk to those people who might be able to share a point of view with them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A8CkAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a failure of content moderation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PLCBwn"&gt;Peer2Peer targets gaps in Twitch’s own tagging system. The streaming company removed the ability to create custom communities, which included identity-based tags, in 2018, and streamers, including Loehr, have continually asked for them to be reinstated, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/25/21176485/twitch-trans-streamers-discoverability-tags"&gt;the ability to self-identify as trans&lt;/a&gt;. Though streamers can tag themselves broadly as LGBTQIA+, trans streamers found that this left them with reduced visibility overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dY5zis"&gt;Harassment for marginalized groups has long been an issue on Twitch, but it’s a problem that can be mitigated in part through visibility and community. “What we had been hearing from Twitch is that they removed the trans tag and other tags because of harassment, but what we actually know as experts in peer support is that when you have the ability to find and connect with community, you actually have much more resilience and support in dealing with harassment,” says Calou. “Trans streamers are saying ‘we’re getting harassed anyway’… It’s a failure of content moderation and the ability to enforce their anti-harassment policies on their part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlO0tc"&gt;Peer2Peer helps to provide that community in several ways. Firstly, it’s worldwide, where Trans Lifeline’s hotline is located in the US and Canada. It doesn’t require picking up the phone, which may be uncomfortable for some. And of course, it’s all virtual in a time of a pandemic. “You can’t go to a gay bar or a queer bar right now, right?” points out Everblack. “Streaming has become this really important space where people could connect…and I think as we’ve launched Peer2Peer we’ve really seen this huge increase in people being able to find one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w21m5M"&gt;“For us on the hotline so many of our callers report that this is the first time that they’ve ever spoken to another trans person,” says Calou. “And so I think…as a viewer being able to find other trans people on Twitch to be able to watch and connect with as you’re questioning or coming out, having those kinds of contact can mean that that’s maybe the first time that people are really interacting with another trans person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLVGs7"&gt;However, Peer2Peer isn’t only for trans users. It also has tags relating to racial identity, disability, religion, and so on. Advisory board member Irene Nieves has been central in keeping the site as inclusive as possible. “A large issue that a lot of people have, especially as people of color or as Black people on Twitch, is that it’s near impossible to find other people unless you already have a pre-existing community,” she says. “So a large part of the work that I do is specifically centered around making sure that we have as many voices being amplified as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k5hmxv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s near impossible to find other people unless you already have a pre-existing community.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W94yyh"&gt;“With Twitch specifically, one of the issues that I personally have and that we’re trying to divest away from with P2P is only highlighting people during events. [For example], only uplifting Black voices during Black History Month,” Nieves adds. “So when we do our outreach specifically at P2P we’re just trying to organically as possible make sure as many people are being seen and represented as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYoZyz"&gt;Everblack has also been focused on keeping the site accessible. “I’ll use a screenreader to read the content out and make sure that it makes sense and that there isn’t information that someone using a screen reader can’t reach,” she says as an example. Calou also emphasizes the consent that’s baked into the platform. Streamers can opt in and out of tags at will and unlist themselves entirely if they choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Chi1Bb"&gt;So far, the platform has spread almost entirely through word of mouth to almost 1,500 streamers. “I’m gonna cry,” Nieves laughs when I ask her about the reception. “We spent a year on this project…and the response has been mindblowing. So many amazing people saying ‘I feel seen, I feel heard.’” Everblack was surprised to see so many people tweeting out screenshots of their profiles. “[Streamers get] a thrill out of seeing their name and their channel and the tags that they assigned. It’s really rewarding to see that,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQLtsA"&gt;“There hasn’t been any negative feedback,” adds Nieves. “There’s always a concern that there’s going to be discriminatory hate or there’s going to be people who don’t necessarily see the value… but it’s just been amazing.” Calou says that it’s gotten some Trans Lifeline employees into watching Twitch who hadn’t known much about streaming before. “People were really surprised and felt like this is this incredible place to discover and find interesting people who share lived experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyQqND"&gt;As the site keeps growing, it’s also becoming more robust. Everblack says that since the team uses the site themselves, they’ve got “a bunch of ideas for new features.” Users have also been suggesting updates, including new tags, via its feedback system. “It’s so cool because it’s ever evolving,” says Nieves. “It’s this rolling stone where it started from a great place because [we wanted] to have all of the tags be as inclusive as possible and as far reaching as possible, but it’s only getting better because people are able to contribute to those tags themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9QBCY"&gt;She gives examples such as the “aromantic” tag, which now has a couple dozen streamers listed underneath it. “When we added it, people went on social media and said ‘I feel seen. I told [P2P] that I wanted to have it represented and… I go back and it got accepted and I can use that.’ What’s so cool is that no tag doesn’t fulfill a purpose. They’re there so that people can feel represented in their identity,” Nieves says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="037OcY"&gt;All of the team members I spoke to also mentioned that, as Peer2Peer grows, they hope it might have a wider influence, including on Twitch itself. “We’re hoping that Twitch can use our website as a reference for doing better themselves, and owning up to their moral responsibility to empower, protect, and foster marginalized streamers on their platform,” says Loehr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kFNVO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Hopefully it can be an example to the company”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uohn6D"&gt;Nieves says she hopes the industry will see why the service Peer2Peer provides is important and act accordingly. “We want Twitch to see this and be like ‘we should be doing this. Look how many people are getting involved,’” she says. Everblack, meanwhile, notes that she would be happy for the site to continue as is, but if Twitch &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; take notice, it could go one of two ways. “Maybe they hire us... and we build this out on their site for them, or at least act as consultants for that. Or Twitch just steals the idea and one day we wake up and everything we did and all of our hard work is nullified by Twitch doing it. I’m fine either way really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54dmws"&gt;“Hopefully it can be an example to the company that this is actually working well for people,” adds Calou. “That this is what we want, and [that they could be] listening to communities about what they want instead of saying what’s ‘actually’ best for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xErYe6"&gt;“In the meantime, it feels really wonderful to be able to build something like this,” they say. “I think particularly what this points to is that if Twitch isn’t going to do this then trans people are figuring out other ways and coming together. If we’re not going to have a seat at the table we’re just going to build our own table.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OpjJdW"&gt;At Best Buy, you can get a refurbished set of the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro truly wireless earbuds &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738397414024596357#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $110 today in the silver colorway&lt;/a&gt;. This model released just a few months ago alongside the Samsung Galaxy S21, and at most retailers they still sell for their original $200 price. The lowest price we’ve seen recently for a new set is $165, and that’s bound to happen again at some point. But if you’re all about saving money, this refurbished deal can’t be beat. The Galaxy Buds Pro provide the “best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to audio expert and &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewer Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBLnKJ"&gt;These come with a charging case, a USB cable, and three pairs of ear tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFuQO6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="8Zrbuj"&gt;Oculus is set to announce some VR games later today, April 21st, and we expect it to share more on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386496/resident-evil-4-vr-remake-oculus-quest-2-announced" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that exciting VR port of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To celebrate the big day, Oculus is reducing the cost of several hit games for Quest headsets. In the mix are some solid games that I can personally recommend, like &lt;em&gt;In Death: Unchained&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Room VR: A Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt;. Check out the sale here. If you’re new to VR and don’t mind throwing down $100 for a mix of some classic experiences bundled together, I’ll provide that link below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside the glass fibers connecting our wireless world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GgBgBWKLbyVdgbxP8ahQaIQJTfY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69162418/adiaconis_untitled_20210419_0197_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TSzjiy"&gt;All modern means of communication rely on glass, from the Gorilla Glass on our phones to the infotainment screens in our cars. Most of the time, the glass is right in front of us, but when it comes to the internet — whether it’s 5G, Starlink satellites, or Wi-Fi — it’s easy to miss the 750,000 miles of fiber optic cables currently running under our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJzJpZ"&gt;These tiny strands of glass carry our photos, emails, and video chats from our phones to data centers to friends and family all across the world. It’s through these hair-thin strands of fiber that we are able to instantly communicate to almost anyone, anywhere, and it all relies on a 5,000-year-old technology: glass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwmHS6Zy5oFKfFikMOTfBb1iQ6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459251/adiaconis_untitled_20210419_0197_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A telecommunications-grade strand of single-core, optical fiber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MlYr8T"&gt;Very little has changed in the way we use glass throughout its long history. It has always been a transparent and durable material through which light passes. And since light can travel quickly and at high frequencies while carrying loads of encoded information, a cable made of near-perfect glass is a secure medium to send all of our communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDegkJ"&gt;When I began researching materials that were shaping our future, Gorilla Glass was the obvious choice. But my path quickly turned to fiber and the urgent need to not only improve data transmission speeds but also provide all of humanity with internet access. Tune into our video to learn more about how these tiny strands of glass create the backbone for present and future of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
