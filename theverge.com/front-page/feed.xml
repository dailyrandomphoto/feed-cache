    <title>Platforms struggle with Taliban policy amid chaotic US withdrawal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywR2hD"&gt;Social platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are coming under new scrutiny for the way they treat Taliban accounts, as the militant Islamist group emerges as the dominant power in Afghanistan in the wake of the US withdrawal. While none of the platforms have publicly changed their policies on the group, moderation practices have come under close scrutiny, and many are shifting resources to ensure the policies are appropriately enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRAVaz"&gt;A particular question &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/17/technology-202-facebook-twitter-youtube-face-high-stakes-question-whether-recognize-taliban/"&gt;raised by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is whether the group will be allowed to wrest control of the official Facebook and Twitter accounts for the government of Afghanistan. While the Taliban has seized effective control over the government, granting access to official accounts could be seen as legitimizing their control over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6TRkkB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JisP0r"&gt;Despite a number of official bans, Taliban forces appear to have embraced tech platforms when reclaiming territory. Early Monday, an official spokesperson for the Taliban &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1427126736026836995"&gt;used Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to claim control of the capital city of Kabul, saying the situation there was “under control.” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/taliban-leaders-used-twitter-and-whatsapp-to-help-capture-kabul/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Taliban officials were circulating WhatsApp numbers that could be used by former regime members to coordinate surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGljGP"&gt;The Taliban is officially banned from all Facebook services, including WhatsApp, but the service’s end-to-end encryption makes it easy for Taliban accounts to avoid moderation action. A WhatsApp spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; that moderators take action against violating accounts when moderators become aware of them — but without access to user communications, it is rare that WhatsApp would become aware of a Taliban account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmBSEg"&gt;Twitter does not have a blanket policy on Taliban activity, but told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it takes action against accounts violating existing rules against violent content or platform manipulation. “The situation in Afghanistan is rapidly evolving,” a spokesperson said. “We’re also witnessing people in the country using Twitter to seek help and assistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Czo5"&gt;Facebook has designated the Taliban as a dangerous organization, which means it removes accounts representing the group and prohibits praise or support of it in user posts. The company has devoted more resources to enforcing that policy in light of the ongoing unrest in Kabul. Still, the company said it is waiting for guidance from outside organizations as to whether the Taliban should be recognized as the de facto government of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnF7yh"&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country but instead respects the authority of the international community in making these determinations,” a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Regardless of who holds power, we will take the appropriate action against accounts and content that breaks our rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxIdjN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5A comes with a bigger battery and screen, smaller price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vCRMtLNtw-FxlEYDSAOV8ZwR-_I=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736882/Pixel_5a_5G_Product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch display and IP67 water-resistance rating.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVJd9p"&gt;Google has officially revealed the Pixel 5A 5G, a phone it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;kind of announced in April&lt;/a&gt; to contradict rumors that it had been canceled. It comes with a short list of updated features compared to its 4A 5G predecessor, including a slightly bigger screen, a much bigger battery, and an IP67 rating for water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UkhGL"&gt;Few though they may be, these are some important tweaks to an already good midrange phone, and the best part is that the price has gotten smaller: in the US it will cost $449, which is $50 less than the Pixel 4A 5G’s introductory price. The 5A goes on sale in the US and Japan on August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dLQBUh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22392246"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUk7QBzrXEbAutV8xElm6bDgbU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786010/Pixel_5a_5G_Lifestyle_Charging__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5A supports wired charging only, and Google says it’s the last Pixel phone that will ship with a charger in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dFP4Ys"&gt;The Pixel 5A’s screen gets a slight boost to 6.34 inches, a small increase over the 4A 5G’s 6.2-inch display. It’s still a 1080p OLED with a standard 60Hz refresh rate, despite rumors of a faster 90Hz display. The battery gets an increase to 4,680mAh, up from 3,885mAh, which Google says will last through a full day of typical use or two days using Extreme Battery Saver mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94D0WL"&gt;The 5A is also the first A-series Pixel to get an official water resistance rating. With IP67 protection, the phone is able to withstand immersion in up to three feet of water for up to 30 minutes. That’s an uncommon feature in the under-$500 class where IP ratings are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KozyrT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10704284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xagOMn"&gt;The Pixel 5A works on all major US carrier networks and continues to offer support for sub-6GHz 5G. Unlike last year, Google will not sell a mmWave-compatible version of the phone. That’s no great loss — mmWave 5G is very fast, but range is highly limited and hard to find. Unfortunately, the 5A is also missing support for C-band 5G frequencies, which Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T will start using at the end of this year to bolster their struggling nationwide 5G networks. Google says it could add the necessary software support later, but won’t commit to doing so at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9NKf7G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0wE2W"&gt;Other specs remain unchanged from the previous model. It still uses a Snapdragon 765G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 12.2-megapixel main and 16-megapixel ultrawide rear cameras and 8-megapixel selfie camera are the same. There’s a rear fingerprint scanner for biometric unlock, an honest-to-god headphone jack, and an 18W charger included in the box (Google says this will be the last Pixel phone to offer one). The phone will ship with Android 11 and is guaranteed Google’s standard three years of OS platform updates and security patch support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08GvuipPmUn5G-8Opsns7neL2YM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786075/Pixel_5a_5G_Cases_Lineup.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case options for the Google Pixel 5A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tZCRck"&gt;Unlike the 4A 5G, the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US. Instead, it’ll be offered directly from the Google Store and through Google Fi. It will be sold in just one finish — “mostly black” — with four colorful case options available separately to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Pixel 6 won’t ship with a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWtKPEFDCN0HQefeC0SXQdK8RF0=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736930/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google joins Apple and Samsung by ditching the in-box charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hXmmGZ"&gt;Google is the latest manufacturer to bid farewell to the in-box charging brick, saying it expects the Pixel 5A will be the last phone to include one. That means the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; won’t include one when they arrive this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWjePu"&gt;The company says that most people already have a USB-C charging brick, so there’s no longer a need to include one with its phones. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231954/samsung-to-gradually-remove-chargers-earbuds-from-future-phones"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; made similar arguments when they announced they would no longer be offering an in-box charger. That may be true, but it’s likely that the cost savings of not including a charger played a big role in those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TBzBgs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22392246"},{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TamQFmgoPzsQwYDmuZj0BqSq-WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781448/ajohnson_210813_4713_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says it expects the Pixel 5A to be the last phone to include the charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aAa6hI"&gt;There’s also an environmental argument for ditching the charger: fewer redundant chargers being shipped to customers theoretically reduces e-waste. That’s tough to prove, though, and potentially just means that the greenhouse gas emissions of producing and shipping accessory chargers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;will be spread around between more companies&lt;/a&gt; as people buy them from third-party manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vxa6t"&gt;One thing seems certain, though: with these three major phone manufacturers committed to removing the charger, smaller companies will have an easier time following suit and doing the same. While phone shoppers may feel like it’s a case of paying the same price and getting less, this is likely a reality that we’ll all have to make peace with, so hold your wall chargers tight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smart updates and a lower price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KnsKmq"&gt;Google is revealing a phone this year where it’s pulling out all the stops and going big on a cutting-edge, in-house designed SoC, upgraded camera specs, and a bold new look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoPVNC"&gt;That phone is not the Pixel 5A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsYSkQ"&gt;If those kinds of show-stopping improvements are what you’re looking for, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;I’d like to point you to the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, coming this fall. The new Pixel 5A on the other hand, is kind of a boring update by comparison. The screen is a bit bigger this time around, there’s an IP rating for water resistance, and the battery gets a decent boost. That’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZbJNX"&gt;Here’s the thing, though: the Pixel 4A and 4A 5G were already really good midrange phones, and rather than messing with a winning formula, Google has made some strategic tweaks to keep the 5A at the top of its class. Even better, the 5A costs $449 — $50 less than the 4A 5G’s introductory price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uVHzk2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10704989"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ePfjnI"&gt;The Pixel 5A is good, but it’s not exactly a slam dunk. There are a few drawbacks to note: its security support policy is good but not class-leading. It’s also weirdly missing software-level support for C-band 5G frequencies that US carriers will start using over the next few years. It’s only being released in the US and Japan, and even in the US it’s not being sold through the major carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU5k3Z"&gt;But all things considered, Google has managed to address some of the weak points in its previous A-series models while also bringing the price down. Not bad for a boring update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YY4e3eGvmohaCLt274ewkXE5ciY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781449/ajohnson_210813_4713_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5A’s screen is slightly bigger than the 4A 5G’s, at 6.34 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KXnfgn"&gt;Google Pixel 5A screen, performance, and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FSHisY"&gt;The Pixel 5A uses a 6.34-inch 1080p OLED screen, which is a bit bigger than the 6.2-inch screen on the 4A 5G. That’s not huge by any means, especially compared to the 6.5-inch-and-beyond panels that are common on budget Android phones. It also uses a standard 60Hz refresh rate, so you don’t get the smoother scrolling experience of faster 90 or 120Hz rates. That’s a feature that’s been steadily trickling down from the flagship class and is available in devices around the 5A’s price, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;’s 90Hz screen up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$500 Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;’s 120Hz panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3g8b52"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you don’t get the smoother scrolling experience of faster 90 or 120Hz rates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mor8Ca"&gt;So the 5A’s screen isn’t a standout, but it is big enough that it doesn’t look quite as out of place next to the competition compared to the 4A and 4A 5G. It’s also just a good quality screen — the OLED technology delivers rich contrast, and it’s bright enough to be viewable outside in direct sun without too much effort. The same can’t be said of some of its competitors’ screens, big as they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsOr5p"&gt;There’s no change to the processing or memory specs from the 4A 5G: the Pixel 5A uses the same Snapdragon 765G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Apps open quickly, and I didn’t notice any significant delays or hiccups going about my daily tasks and social media scrolling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2azxqq"&gt;Complex image processing tasks are also carried out in a second or two, and that happens in the background so you can keep taking portrait mode photos without having to wait for every frame to finish processing. As someone who takes too many portrait mode photos of her cat in hopes of getting just the right shot, I truly appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WK1pFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heavy users should comfortably get a day out of the battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5hnWn"&gt;The jump in battery life compared to its predecessor is a bigger story for the Pixel 5A. It gets a 4,680mAh cell compared to the 4A 5G’s 3,885mAh. That’s much closer to the 5,000mAh batteries that are common among the competition. Google calls it “all day” performance, with up to 48 hours of stamina if you turn on extreme battery saver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMXlTs"&gt;I got better results in my real-world testing — a day of moderate use including around three hours of screentime typically drained it down to only 70 percent. Heavy users should comfortably get a day out of the battery, and if you’re a lighter user who spends more time on Wi-Fi, you can expect to get 48 hours even without battery saver enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRT6Cioy99RuDTQeSgk1t2zJ9Jc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781452/ajohnson_210813_4713_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of this year’s case options, “likely lime,” features bright green accents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uOHC5R"&gt;Google Pixel 5A IP rating and build quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CelYOt"&gt;The Pixel 5A includes an IP67 dust and waterproof rating, meaning it can be submerged in about three feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Official IP ratings are rare in the $500-and-under bracket outside of the Samsung A52 5G and iPhone SE, so this is one area where the 5A rises to the top of the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlGnl2"&gt;On the front panel there’s Gorilla Glass 6 for screen protection and underneath, the phone’s outer plastic shell is a metal unibody. The plastic panel features a matte finish that I appreciate — it’s less slippery than a glossy finish and doesn’t show smudges as easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjdv9d"&gt;There’s just one color option this year: black. You can spice things up with one of the colorful case options, which are designed for added protection against drops and bumps. Some are more neutral, like “black moss” and “maybe moon” (and also sound like Neko Case song titles?), but I opted for “likely lime” with my review unit and, reader, I do not like it. There’s a subtle 1990’s Nickelodeon vibe about it. Give me the fabric case back, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsDX3SyDEYXfF58kJLK4zYKEcXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781446/ajohnson_210813_4713_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At launch, the 5A is only available in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f16XWo"&gt;Google Pixel 5A software and 5G connectivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FgoLkh"&gt;The 5A ships with Android 11 and is backed by Google’s typical three-year OS and security update policy. That’s a longer shelf life than most budget phones, but Samsung recently started offering four years of security updates with its budget A-series devices, and Apple will offer its latest OS upgrade to the six-year-old iPhone 6S this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0is7E"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity on the Pixel 5A. It supports sub-6GHz 5G on all of the major US carriers, and unlike the 4A 5G, won’t be sold in a mmWave-compatible variant. Verizon insists on selling phones that can connect with its super-fast, hard-to-find mmWave 5G network so, like many other device manufacturers, Google came up with a more expensive version of the 4A 5G compatible with the network for Verizon’s retail shelves. That’s not happening this time around and nobody will miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PKkuru"&gt;&lt;q&gt;mmWave 5G is no great loss, but the 5A’s lack of C-band support at launch is more worrisome&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naBJWN"&gt;mmWave 5G is no great loss, but the 5A’s lack of C-band support at launch is more worrisome. C-band is the good mid-band stuff that carriers will gradually begin adding at the end of this year and over the next few years. The Pixel 5A has the hardware support and FCC certification to use C-band, but Google hasn’t enabled software-level support for these frequencies. It could add support in the future, but isn’t committing to doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4YlkP"&gt;There are numerous budget and midrange phones on sale right now that fully support C-band, starting as low as the $279 Galaxy A32, so it’s odd that Google won’t commit to supporting it. T-Mobile customers don’t need to worry as much since it won’t be relying much on C-band. But if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T and you plan to keep using your phone for the next two to three years, this could become a real drawback as those carriers enable C-band and (in theory) strengthen their 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYsXtUkyrZ9VBEPTlXHiaI1Ts34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781450/ajohnson_210813_4713_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel camera is still the low light champ of the budget class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YkYEJw"&gt;Google Pixel 5A camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cfk49Y"&gt;The 5A’s camera hardware is another place where it doesn’t look especially exciting on paper, but it adds up to much more than the sum of its specs. The 12.2-megapixel main rear camera includes optical image stabilization, which is hard to find under $500. This kind of lens-based stabilization helps ensure more of your shots are sharp, which is especially handy in dimmer light conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhMFB"&gt;That camera is accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and there’s an 8-megapixel selfie camera. This might not seem like much next to the triple- and quad- rear camera arrays on other phones, but those third and fourth cameras are usually low-quality macro and depth sensors that aren’t actually very useful anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VmbMsE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10704996"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mSQsTJ"&gt;If those specs sound familiar, that’s because it’s the same hardware as the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4A 5G, and that’s actually fine for this model. Even without new sensors or lenses, the 5A still offers the best photo quality in the midrange class, thanks largely of course to Google’s smart image processing. Plenty of the Pixel 5A’s competitors can take good photos in bright outdoor light, but Google is still the low light champion in the budget class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7GnfQ"&gt;Unsurprisingly, what was true of the 4A and 5’s image capabilities is also true of the 5A. It handles high contrast scenes well, and colors are rendered a bit more naturally than you’ll get from a Samsung phone. Portrait and night mode photos are among the best you can get from a midrange phone, though you can certainly spot their limitations with trickier subjects. Google has more work cut out for itself in equipping the Pixel 6 to stay competitive with the Samsung and Apple flagships of the world. In the budget class, it can afford to stand still for another year just because it got such a good running start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TamQFmgoPzsQwYDmuZj0BqSq-WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781448/ajohnson_210813_4713_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no wireless charging here, and the 5A will be the last Pixel sold with a charging brick in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nPFt5r"&gt;There are $400 and $500 phones with flashier standout features than the Google Pixel 5A. The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G features a big 6.5-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate. The TCL 20 Pro offers a flagship-esque curved display and wireless charging. The Motorola Moto G Stylus includes a huge display and (of course) a stylus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYSwnL"&gt;But the Pixel 5A is just a good all-arounder with a great UI, speedy software updates, and all of the basics covered at a reasonable price. The 4A 5G was already a good phone, and the 5A’s smart improvements like waterproofing and a bigger battery make it easier than ever to recommend this phone to a wide range of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VPsBq7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this is a very boring, very good phone that I think a lot of people would like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5gTI3"&gt;There’s the unfortunate case of C-band 5G and whether Google will add support for it in the future. It’s hard to imagine the company refusing to support it once the frequencies are in wide use, but we’re firm believers that you shouldn’t buy a gadget today based on a potential update tomorrow. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers should take that into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmMMP7"&gt;It’s a shame that the Pixel 5A will see such a limited release, both in terms of countries where it will be available and where it will (and won’t) be sold in the US, because it’s a phone I’d recommend to a lot of people. It exceeds the competition in a few ways, like its class-leading camera and waterproofing, and meets it in others, like its just-big-enough screen and improved battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OpKsT7"&gt;With its more limited availability, it seems likely to become an “if you know you know” kind of device rather than the phone you tell your uncle to buy when he asks you what to get with his two-year carrier upgrade deal. That’s too bad, because this is a very boring, very good phone that I think a lot of people would like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft hires former Uber exec to lead a new consumer apps effort</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgUGrxJFyaxlrFiaJdU3ll5kXnU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736761/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sDr8ho"&gt;Microsoft is hiring Manik Gupta, the former head of product at Uber, in a renewed effort to boost Microsoft’s consumer apps. Gupta will be responsible for Microsoft Teams consumer, Skype, and GroupMe, and he will report directly to Jeff Teper, Microsoft’s head of Microsoft 365 collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JsAr"&gt;Gupta spent four years at Uber running the various teams that contribute to the Uber app, and he also oversaw product management for Google Maps for seven years. While Gupta has a lot of experience in maps, that’s not why he’s joining Microsoft. The software giant appears to be keen to tap into his wealth of experience in consumer-focused apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2jGkq"&gt;“Manik’s experience... will be invaluable to us building world-class consumer experiences across all of Microsoft,” says Teper in an internal memo, obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Teper’s memo makes it clear that Microsoft has big ambitions for getting consumers into using Teams, and other opportunities to create communities or apps focused on consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JoC0O2Ct_Bkh6UDHlKgO_uq0418=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268967/acastro_210129_1777_discord_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has been trying to acquire consumer-focused services recently like Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5BHO8"&gt;Microsoft has been trying to acquire popular communities recently, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352309/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-deal-why-us-countries-data"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277845/microsoft-pinterest-acquisition-azure-cloud-services-rumors"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352028/microsoft-discord-acquisition-analysis-report"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;. While all three services are very different, they all share a common community element which, outside of Xbox, Microsoft lacks. Rivals like Google, Amazon, Facebook have all acquired big consumer apps like YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram, and Microsoft knows it needs something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYzMDm"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella seems focused on creators and communities, and how best to leverage the cloud to have a consumer-focused app or community. “Creation, creation, creation — the next 10 years is going to be as much about creation as it is about consumption and about the community around it, so it’s not creating alone,” said Nadella in an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/microsoft-ceo-hunts-anew-for-creator-hub-in-discord-after-tiktok-bid-fails"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21zCmp"&gt;It’s a shift that has been years in the making at Microsoft, after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16401898/microsoft-groove-music-pass-discontinued-spotify-partner"&gt;killed off its Groove Music service&lt;/a&gt;, gave up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;on Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542870/microsoft-kinect-dead-stop-manufacturing"&gt;discontinued Kinect&lt;/a&gt;, scrapped its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/3/13152590/microsoft-band-discontinued"&gt;Microsoft Band fitness device&lt;/a&gt;, and finally admitted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead"&gt;Windows Phone was dead&lt;/a&gt;. With the exception of Xbox, Microsoft has had a tough time with consumers, and Microsoft has been trying to alter that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594508/microsoft-consumer-push-2018"&gt;over the past few years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I52i_Ue6jRAMXrVlKsnoUDvaCFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/2361219/skypestock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future of Skype seems very Microsoft Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wuJfwb"&gt;In an internal memo today, Nadella makes it clear Microsoft is focused on consumer products again. “I want us to go after these new opportunities with both ambition and clarity of long-term product vision. Building new capability inside our organization to drive ‘consumer-grade’ product ethos will be key to our success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCSNeb"&gt;Although Teper’s memo doesn’t directly mention it, Gupta’s role means he’ll have to tackle the delicate balance of Teams for consumers, Skype, and GroupMe, and whether Microsoft will combine these services into a single effort or not. It increasingly looks like Microsoft is more focused on Teams than Skype for consumers, and it’s easy to forget that Microsoft still runs GroupMe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLlwxI"&gt;Windows 11, which should arrive in October, includes Microsoft Teams integration in what Teper describes as “one of the most important milestones for us to delight users and grow our consumer business.” This type of Teams integration looks like an early hint at where Microsoft will focus most of its consumer efforts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDxCXd"&gt;Here’s the full internal memo from Jeff Teper, head of Microsoft 365 collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4FjiZ3"&gt;I am thrilled to announce that we have hired Manik Gupta, as Corporate Vice President for Teams Consumer, Skype, and GroupMe. Manik will report directly to me assuming general management leadership for our end-to-end consumer strategy, vision, and execution. Manik’s experience at Uber as Chief Product Officer, at Google as Director PM for Google Maps, and his current role as an investor and advisor to early-stage, high-growth technology companies, will be invaluable to us building world-class consumer experiences across all of Microsoft. Manik will officially start on August 30th and will be based in the Bay Area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7EcAd"&gt;Over the last few years, we have partnered across the company to grow Microsoft Teams to over a quarter billion users and the launch of Teams for Life in May is helping us connect many more people in their personal lives. But we have a much bigger opportunity ahead. I am energized by the increased progress and investment across Microsoft in our consumer experiences – Xbox, Microsoft 365, OneDrive, Edge, Bing, and much more. This fall Windows 11 – with Microsoft Teams – represents one of the most important milestones for us to delight users and grow our consumer business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAtw36"&gt;With Manik joining us to lead this, Rohit Wad will assume responsibility for engineering and will report to Manik as will Rohit’s PM reports. Rohit has been an outstanding driver of the launch of Teams for Life, Skype, and GroupMe and I am excited for him to take our experiences and engineering to the next level. Manik, Rohit, and team will partner across the entire Teams organization and the rest of Microsoft to grow our consumer services and make our products better for everyone across their whole lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>YouTube will show video chapters right in search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F62xFfzmePlBnSwjOGov7rho4FY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736466/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBGCdo"&gt;YouTube is announcing some new features for search to make it easier to find what you’re looking for amid the huge amount of content on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga5gBA"&gt;One helpful update is that YouTube will show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272095/youtube-chapters-feature-video-google-android-ios-desktop-mobile"&gt;video chapters&lt;/a&gt; right in search results, which should make it easier to jump to the exact part of a video that might be most helpful to you. Instead of having to tap into a video and scroll through the chapters just to find exactly the information that you’re looking for, you’ll be able to see the chapters from a search so you can navigate to certain spots in a video more easily. YouTube is also adding video previews to search results on mobile, meaning you can see a short clip of a video before you tap into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="48x0Ob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Video previews are coming to mobile search results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14OB8H"&gt;Another change is designed to help people find videos if there isn’t any content about what they’re looking for in their local language. If that’s the case, YouTube will show videos with automatically translated captions, titles, and descriptions in search results. The videos that will show up, in this case, are in English to start, but the company plans to expand this to more languages in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPUzIP"&gt;And to further help people find information on YouTube, the company is experimenting with adding website links and “other formats” from Google Search to YouTube search results. This experiment is only available on mobile in India and Indonesia, but the company says it will “consider expanding” the feature to additional countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="au0jDH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube’s new chapters feature is rolling out on desktop and mobile","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272095/youtube-chapters-feature-video-google-android-ios-desktop-mobile"},{"title":"YouTube chief product officer Neal Mohan on the algorithm, monetization, and the future for creators","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22606296/youtube-shorts-fund-neal-mohan-decoder-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>There’s finally a new Densha de Go! train controller, and it’s awesome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jl9sCQYrTqX5I0MeJ3zI8hQYgYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736298/DSCF7743.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3uxKE"&gt;Imagine if you were really into a video game series, but no one released a controller that let you play it properly for 14 years. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the situation that fans of &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt; found themselves in until recently. Taito’s quirky train-driving franchise has been around since the mid-‘90s across countless systems and devices, but it just isn’t the same if you can’t slam the brakes with a giant lever as you pull into the station 17 seconds late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyY4uS"&gt;This month, though, a company called Zuiki came to the rescue with the release of an officially licensed &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt; controller for the Nintendo Switch. It works with the latest version of the game, &lt;em&gt;Hashirou Yamanote-sen&lt;/em&gt;, and it marks the first console controller to be released since the Wii iteration in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BZDlq6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2I1EAJAPJ4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RO6gIA"&gt;In fairness, the series isn’t even supposed to be a going concern these days. Ostensibly the last ever version, &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go! Final&lt;/em&gt; was released for the PS2 in 2004. But various spinoffs and ports continued to appear, and the game got a full-on reboot for arcades in 2017, simply titled &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt;. An adaptation of that game made its way to the PS4 last year as &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go! Hashirou Yamanote-sen&lt;/em&gt;, and subsequently to the Switch in March. Until now, though, you weren’t able to play this version with a train controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otdEoC"&gt;The arcade reboot provided a solid basis, and &lt;em&gt;Hashirou Yamanote-sen&lt;/em&gt; is a great addition to the series. It uses the Unreal Engine and is far more technically advanced than any other &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt; title, with near-photorealistic 3D graphics. The game centers around the JR Yamanote line, the circular route that loops around Tokyo’s busiest districts, and the experience feels deeply authentic — buildings and station features are clearly recognizable, with an audio mix that’ll sound familiar to anyone who’s ever visited the city. Really, the only thing that’s missing is the station-specific jingles that play upon departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMXqZC"&gt;The Switch version is not quite as sparkly clean as what you get on the PS4, unsurprisingly, but it acquits itself well enough. You’ll see the resolution drop visibly from time to time, but the thing about &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt; is that you’ll mostly be concentrating on the icons and stats in the HUD rather than pixel-counting the graphics, and on the Switch the fidelity is decent enough to give a convincing impression of a train ride if you don’t pay too much attention. The PS4 version has VR support, though, which depending on your perspective could be more or less immersive than using a dedicated train controller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WJl7kc_PX-5TYSrWDhOWGjGckXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787291/DSCF7744.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uUiOLb"&gt;So about that controller. As with the recent arcade version, Zuiki has gone with a “one-handle” design, as opposed to many traditional &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt; controllers that have separate levers for acceleration and braking. With this one, you push up to brake and pull back to accelerate, with a thumb button to unlock the latter range of motion. It’s not unlike an automatic shifter on a car. Almost everything is plastic, but the controller feels high quality — it has a hefty build that won’t move around on your coffee table while you’re using it, and the handle has satisfying clunks between each setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTBf9F"&gt;Do you need it to play the game? No. But also... kind of? &lt;em&gt;Hashirou Yamanote-sen&lt;/em&gt; has been out on the PS4 for almost a year without any controller support, but it was still well-received in Japan. When you use a PS4 or Switch controller, though, you have to hold an analog stick in position to maintain your speed or brake force, and the game recognizes fewer degrees of each. With this Zuiki controller, you get eight levels of brake power plus an emergency setting that requires more physical force to activate. The ratcheted stick design means each brake position stays where it is once you move to it, as opposed to a controller analog stick that springs back without constant pressure. Acceleration, meanwhile, has three levels that can be left as they are while you’re cruising, with two higher speeds that snap back if you don’t hold them in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iXytm"&gt;The controller makes playing the game a much more physical, reactive, and satisfying experience. &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt; is all about modulating your speed — you need to accelerate and brake at the right time between stations, and come to a perfect stop at the right point on the platform. You’ll be penalized if you get either wrong. It’s one of those arcade games that can be both relaxing and stressful, with a simple, challenging concept that provides immense relief when you pull off a great run. That feeling is only amplified when you have more direct control over the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tpPJTYsppBT8hAkczsJ6BlV_6JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787290/DSCF7745.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zJo5JS"&gt;I’ve owned various iterations of &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go!&lt;/em&gt; over the years. From the Dreamcast version with the popular Type 2 controller, to the Osaka Loop Line-specific PSP game back when I was living in that city, to the oddly compelling monochrome WonderSwan port from 1999, all of them have had their own appeal. The Zuiki controller provides arguably the best home experience yet, though. I would have preferred a PlayStation-compatible version for the better graphics and VR support, and &lt;em&gt;Hashirou Yamanote-sen&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have the most content of the series, but this Switch release bodes well for the future of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKL469"&gt;That said, this is obviously going to be a niche product. Zuiki says it won’t make any more once stock runs out, and at 14,850 yen ($135), it’s clearly targeted at converted fans. Taito released a plug-and-play controller with an HD port of &lt;em&gt;Densha de Go! Final&lt;/em&gt; built in a few years ago for almost exactly the same price, which would probably be a better entry point for novices. The Zuiki controller doesn’t even include the &lt;em&gt;Hashirou Yamanote-sen&lt;/em&gt; game, which hasn’t been released outside Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2Jk6q"&gt;Still, this is a well-executed product, and its existence is a welcome surprise. Hopefully it won’t take 14 years until the next one — or even better, hopefully this one gets 14 years of support. I know I’d be down to use it to travel beyond Tokyo’s city limits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics shows how bipedal Atlas robot flips, vaults, and falls over in latest videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfLWRGSmhEwnUiZDGrpvn2ZbBdk=/259x0:2299x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736169/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_2.42.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C0oY45"&gt;Boston Dynamics has published a pair of new videos showcasing its bipedal Atlas robot. The first is &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/tF4DML7FIWk"&gt;typical Boston Dynamics flash&lt;/a&gt;, with two Atlas units demonstrating an extremely impressive gymnastics routine. They flip, they vault, they &lt;em&gt;nearly fall &lt;/em&gt;over but not quite — it’s brilliant. The second video, though, offers an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EezdinoG4mk"&gt;unusually transparent assessment&lt;/a&gt; of Atlas’ capabilities, as the company’s engineers explain what goes into creating these routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AG19af"&gt;As Boston Dynamics has said before, Atlas is essentially a research project: a cutting-edge machine that helps the company’s engineers work out better control and perception systems. “At a practical level it’s a platform for us to do R&amp;amp;D on,” says Benjamin Stephens, control lead for Atlas, in the video. That research includes these gymnastic and parkour routines, with which the company regularly delights (and unnerves) the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jkim4O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EezdinoG4mk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="guqGgs"&gt;Some roboticists, though, have criticized Boston Dynamics for misleading people about the capabilities of its machines. Its videos are impressive, yes, but they’re also tightly structured demonstrations — orchestrated routines that take a lot of tinkering and tweaking to pull off. You can’t just point Atlas at a course and let it do its thing, as Stephens explains in the behind the scenes video: “It’s not the robot just magically deciding to do parkour, it’s kind of a choreographed routine, much like a skateboard video or a parkour video.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZFqGQ"&gt;It’s great to have that clarity, and in an &lt;a href="https://blog.bostondynamics.com/atlas-leaps-bounds-and-backflips"&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s engineers give some more detail about how the robot has changed over the years. They note that in past demonstrations it was essentially blind — just pumping out moves that would succeed as long as its environment was unchanged. But now it does rely more on its own perception to navigate, meaning it’s less preprogrammed than before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcaPUg"&gt;“In this iteration of parkour, the robot is adapting behaviors in its repertoire based on what it sees,” says the blog post. “This means the engineers don’t need to pre-program jumping motions for all possible platforms and gaps the robot might encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO5IJ4"&gt;And compared to past gymnastic routines, today’s video is notable, with the robot’s movements even looking a little &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; at times. Just look at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/tF4DML7FIWk?t=37"&gt;this moment&lt;/a&gt; around 37 seconds in when Atlas jumps onto a platform, wobbles for a second, and then regains its balance. That’s the sort of dynamic response you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; preprogram and all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scuf’s Instinct Pro has more pop, but fewer features, than the Xbox Elite Series 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Scuf Instinct" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0poLyucepp_8z4sLOTFgoXrZBt0=/0x0:5451x3634/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736156/scufinstincthero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This dizzyingly gorgeous gamepad is a costly investment.&lt;/em&gt; | Scuf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKcCwm"&gt;Scuf has introduced two pricey controllers, &lt;a href="https://scufgaming.com/xbox-scuf-instinct"&gt;the $170 Instinct and the $200 Instinct Pro&lt;/a&gt;. They’re made for Xbox, and to that end, they feel like Microsoft’s official controller in fit and finish. I mean that quite literally because they have the same dimensions as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21452750/microsoft-xbox-series-x-controller-1tb-expansion-cards-hands-on"&gt;the newer Xbox wireless controller&lt;/a&gt; that ships with the Series X and S consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPJxiS"&gt;The similarities go all the way down to the main board, which Scuf told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is, in fact, the same as Microsoft’s. This means that Scuf’s new controllers will use Microsoft’s dynamic latency input protocol to nip lag in the bud, and they will get all of the firmware updates and improvements as the official Xbox controllers. These are the first wireless controllers made by a third party that were designed to work seamlessly with the Xbox Series S and X consoles. In addition, it works on Xbox One, as well as PC with the Xbox USB wireless adapter, or via Bluetooth with iOS, Android, and other platforms that support gamepads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQbp9n"&gt;The Instinct series controllers are far from being a copy of the default wireless controller in terms of features, and in some cases they mirror or go beyond what’s available with the $180 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Xbox Elite Series 2 controller&lt;/a&gt;. The Instinct Pro has switches located beneath each trigger that can vastly shorten their travel distances when activated (down to approximately 0.2mm), making it feel like you’re clicking a mouse. The Instinct Pro also has rubber grips around the back that offer far more grab than your average controller. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scuf Instinct" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SME-hXsjft_pAwaCSpLeVabiDUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786205/scufinstinctrear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Scuf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a switch under each rear trigger that can toggle between full travel or approximately 0.2mm travel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IAOmTz"&gt;Those features make up the $30 price difference between the Instinct models. Otherwise, they’re the same, with swappable faceplates, thumbsticks (and the anti-friction rings around them), and D-pads to give your controller a custom feel and look. Each controller ships with one faceplate (replacements start at $24.99 and go up depending on the design), four thumbsticks (two regular concave sticks that match the color palette of your Instinct model, as well as one tall black domed stick and one short domed stick), and a hybrid eight-way D-pad much like the one on Microsoft’s latest controller. The D-pad can be replaced with a cross-shaped option for $9.99. Extra thumbsticks come in a two-pack for $9.99 or a four-pack for $14.99. The Instinct series controllers ship with a 6.5-foot USB-A to USB-C cable for wired play, and it will sell a 12-foot cable on its site for $19.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v9rNe"&gt;On Scuf’s site, you’ll be able to buy all of these accessories, as well as customize an Instinct controller to your liking. If you’re someone who wants a lighter controller, you can even opt to remove its vibration motors in the grips for $3.99 (though, the Impulse trigger-specific motors will stay put, apparently), shedding 20 percent of its weight. To say that Scuf has built an ecosystem of accessories around the Instinct controllers is a bit of an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scuf Instinct" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRuFa8zpWYj7x8H9BuGzdruAmY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786210/scufinstinctcoloroptions.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Scuf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of Scuf’s faceplate options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qFWZZL"&gt;In addition to tweaking how the Instinct looks and feels with regard to its analog sticks, some of the functionality is open for customization. Both controllers have four rear, nonremovable paddle buttons that can be programmed to perform the same functions as almost any of the buttons (aside from the Xbox button, share, or the rear triggers), which may save you some time or frustration if you aren’t content with a game’s default controller scheme. The Instinct supports up to three saved profiles, and you toggle between them with a rear button that changes the color of the front-facing LED between blue, red, and green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCyc3T"&gt;The Instinct series has a mute button near its bottom that only works when a headset is plugged in. Notably, the mute button works on the hardware level, so it’ll work with your wired headphones whether you’re using it with Xbox, PC, or with another platform like iOS or Android. Lastly, the Instinct controllers have a magnetic battery hatch and it supports regular AA batteries, rechargeable ones, as well as the Xbox Play &amp;amp; Charge kit made for the Series X and S controller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scuf Instinct" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jl0o8tmPDeHaMQB_TBT6Hra1geI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786212/scufinstantwiggles.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Scuf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The look and feel isn’t far off from Microsoft’s own Xbox controller. In fact, this has the same dimensions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kXggLh"&gt;I like that you can thoroughly tweak its appearance and the rear paddles, but it’s hard to ignore that the $180 (and sometimes cheaper) Xbox Elite Series 2 offers almost all of the same highlight features as the $200 Instinct Pro, as well as some unique ones that are sorely missing here. The Elite Series 2 has adjustable analog stick tension, a rechargeable battery (though, some may view this as a flaw), and a hard case included, which make it a little easier to warrant the high cost. Though, if you value a flashier look over more features, Scuf’s Instinct series controllers might be the preferred pick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This suitcase-sized power station is designed to get you through a blackout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JondJXJle828u20i_5RW8OlFTJk=/0x0:2508x1672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736122/6720x4480.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="assJUh"&gt;Zendure’s latest “portable” charger is the SuperBase Pro 2000, a hulking power station equipped with a 2,096Wh battery that’s designed to get you through everything from a camping trip to a blackout. Weighing in at 46.5 pounds (21.2kg), it’s only portable in the technical sense of the word — you’re much more likely to use its built-in handle to wheel it around like a rollable suitcase. It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fproject%2Fpreview%2F75d5579b%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F17%2F22628532%2Fzendure-superbase-pro-2000-power-station-solar-charge-blackout-camping" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launching on Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; with an early bird price starting at $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8TmEN"&gt;We’ve generally liked Zendure’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21409482/zendure-supertank-pro-charger-review"&gt;more portable chargers&lt;/a&gt; designed for smaller devices like phones and laptops, and this isn’t the first time it’s offered a &lt;a href="https://zendure.com/collections/superbase500/products/superbase-500"&gt;beefier power station&lt;/a&gt; for more power-hungry electronics (competitors &lt;a href="https://www.aukey.com/collections/power-station/products/powerzeus-500-portable-power-station-518wh"&gt;Aukey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower-station%2Fproducts%2Fa1750&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F17%2F22628532%2Fzendure-superbase-pro-2000-power-station-solar-charge-blackout-camping" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt; sell similar units). But what sets the SuperBase Pro 2000 apart is its sheer power capacity, which is measured in thousands of watt-hours rather than hundreds, and the fact it can be charged in just two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xHj6RX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rsGa9f"&gt;Its battery capacity means you can keep a 65W mini fridge running for over 24 hours, recharge a 13-inch MacBook 32 times, or 148 times for an iPhone 12, Zendure says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoMcm3"&gt;It also seems pretty versatile. Zendure says there are half a dozen ways to charge the SuperBase Pro, ranging from a standard AC outlet to solar panels, portable generators, or from a car. There are 14 ports for drawing power, including six AC outlets and four USB-C ports. The AC outlets can output 2,000W (4,000W surge capability), meaning they can power household appliances like kettles, toasters, and even hairdryers. It’s also equipped with a 6.1-inch LCD display, and even LTE connectivity to allow the power station to be controlled remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1O3Mf"&gt;The Zendure SuperBase Pro 2000 starts at $1,299 for its cheapest early-bird pricing, and a regular price of $2,299. There’s also a cheaper SuperBase Pro 1500, which has a smaller 1,456Wh battery and has an early-bird price of $999 (standard price $1,999). Finally, Zendure is selling portable solar panels with a standard price of $599.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQG1Lu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
