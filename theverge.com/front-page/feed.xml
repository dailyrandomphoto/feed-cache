    <title>Signal’s founder is trolling with an NFT that’ll turn to shit if you buy it</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V77lHDVxBl2gxwCAoOk899qg_9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69995554/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ygwQr6"&gt;Secure messaging app Signal’s founder Moxie Marlinspike is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1448066579611234305"&gt;doing a bit of trolling&lt;/a&gt; by releasing an NFT that shows up differently depending on what platform you’re looking at it on — and that will, allegedly, display as a poop emoji in your wallet if you actually buy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htTl2i"&gt;He seems to be doing this to point out the potential fragility of NFTs, which are supposed to act as a sort of permanent record of owning a piece of art or media. They’re unique digital tokens that are stored on the blockchain, but in most cases, it’s actually just the record that lives on the chain — the image is stored elsewhere. That means that people shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars for them could be at the mercy of image hosts who are operating independently from the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QZGGpl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I created an NFT, but the image renders differently based on who's looking at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, on OpenSea: &lt;a href="https://t.co/XI0hSerW5y"&gt;https://t.co/XI0hSerW5y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...vs on Rarible: &lt;a href="https://t.co/gQTH4tcR9k"&gt;https://t.co/gQTH4tcR9k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...vs if you own it, it currently renders as a large   emoji in your wallet. How this works:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/n&lt;/p&gt;— Moxie Marlinspike (@moxie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1448066579611234305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWJ4Xs"&gt;It’s no secret that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;many NFTs would be in peril&lt;/a&gt; if the servers hosting them were to go down. For the most part, they’re not stored on the blockchain; the art is just a link. According to Marlinspike, that’s how he’s pulling this off — he’s made the image render differently based on the IP or user agent that’s requesting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5TIKTC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10807563"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0512kL"&gt;(And yes, I have checked to make sure that both the &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307:1?tab=history"&gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307/1"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; pages are actually displaying &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307?a=1#inventory"&gt;the same token&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve got doubts, you can use Rarible’s “View on OpenSea” button, located in the “...” menu to see for yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V14x9G"&gt;It probably won’t be a surprise that someone named Moxie Marlinspike is no stranger to trolling and IRL antics. &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/"&gt;There are stories&lt;/a&gt; of him buying and crashing a hot air balloon or using a picture of himself in an asparagus-shaped hat as his profile at a very serious conference. And who can forget &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/"&gt;the Instagram ads Signal tried to run&lt;/a&gt; that showed what Facebook’s advertising profile thinks about you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ee39bo"&gt;Marlinspike is also no stranger to having off-the-beaten-path political views that have led to him being labeled an anarchist (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14244634/signal-app-secure-messaging-trump-surveillance-encryption"&gt;we asked him years ago&lt;/a&gt; if that label was accurate, and he said it was complicated); he’s heavily &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1267486874441932800"&gt;advocated against law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/"&gt;said that their jobs should be difficult&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amYwgc"&gt;What I’m getting at is that it’s not surprising that he’s poking some fun at NFTs and how they work. It is a bit odd, though, that he seems confused as to why people would be bidding on an NFT that turns into a poop emoji. I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;have you seen some of the NFTs people buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; A $400 bid for a changing NFT seems totally believable at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GuvtiM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Would any of the people who've been bidding on my NFT be willing to host an AMA? I have so many questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, "Is it clear to you that what you're bidding on will render as   emoji in your wallet?"&lt;a href="https://t.co/gBUl67rPvH"&gt;https://t.co/gBUl67rPvH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ts3lkajS9W"&gt;https://t.co/ts3lkajS9W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Moxie Marlinspike (@moxie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1448687312011874304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 review: overpriced and underpowered</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A polished PC with inconsistent performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="idJmew"&gt;I can’t tell you how excited I was to test the Zephyrus M16. It takes the AMD-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;’s exceptional chassis and adds the two things I most wish that laptop had: a 16:10 display and a webcam. That sounds like a great package on paper, but there’s one other major thing that also differentiates the M16 from the G15: its Intel processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sHSeT"&gt;A review of the M16, then, isn’t just an opportunity to evaluate Asus’ product. It’s also an opportunity to answer a question I’ve been wondering since I first reviewed the G15 earlier this year (and gave the highest score I’ve given a laptop in my career): how much of the G15’s excellence has to do with Asus’s engineering, and how much has to do with the combined power and efficiency of AMD’s processors? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Republic of Gamers Est 2006 nameplate on the bottom right corner of the Zephyrus M16 lid." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGOtnGldIXGFYGMrHmvZMS9z_Ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810020/akrales_210824_4725_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just wish this had an RTX 3070.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YtJzJP"&gt;The M16 has rendered a fairly clear verdict: a lot of it is AMD. The Zephyrus G15 leaves the M16 in the dust, not just in terms of raw frame rates and battery life, but in terms of power-per-dollar. While the Zephyrus M16 does have a few advantages that will be significant for some, the Zephyrus G15 is unambiguously better value for the majority of shoppers. The M16 has a gorgeous chassis with a standout display, but it’s also a real-world illustration of how far behind Intel currently is in value as well as efficiency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Cyoc3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10807135"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2qrqo9PH4DOOy0ovbpbdQdRZo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810027/akrales_210824_4725_0125.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love this keyboard, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fQ0h1q"&gt;In addition to the screen and processor, the significant differentiator between the M16 and the G15 is price. There are two M16 models listed on &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-m16-series/wtb"&gt;Asus’ website&lt;/a&gt;: my test model (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMTBHVU05f" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,849.99&lt;/a&gt;) with a Core i9-11900H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a QHD 165Hz display, and a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMTEwcmP6g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,449 option&lt;/a&gt; with a Core i7-11800H, an RTX 3050 Ti, a 512GB SSD, and a 1920 x 1200 144Hz display. (The latter one is kind of an odd configuration — 512GB really isn’t a lot of storage for a gaming laptop, and the 3050 Ti isn’t going to take full advantage of a 144Hz screen on a lot of titles.) A G15 with an RTX 3060 is &lt;a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/rog/catalog/product/view/id/1795/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;significantly cheaper&lt;/a&gt; at $1,499 — though that model only has 512GB of storage, it also has a more efficient Ryzen 9 5900HS processor. &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-15-6-qhd-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-1tb-ssd-eclipse-grey-eclipse-grey%2F6448848.p%3FskuId%3D6448848&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $1,849.99&lt;/a&gt;, you can get a G15 with specs identical to this M16 model but a more powerful RTX 3070. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 facing away from the camera, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ol_2eIlCiCMgGrLKJwSQHiWtJyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810021/akrales_210824_4725_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bigger battery, bigger charger, better screen, and better chips than the previous Zephyrus M15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TVtX3X"&gt;So the Intel-based M16 is already fighting an uphill battle when it comes to value. What does the extra money get you? It’s mostly the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aehtli"&gt;If you’re looking for a QHD 165Hz display with a 16:10 aspect ratio (which allows Asus to cram a 16-incher into a chassis that’s not much bigger than most 15-inch gaming laptops), the Zephyrus M16 is one of few places you’ll find it. Put this next to the G15, and the main difference you’ll notice is that where the G15 has a large and visible chin, the M16 just has more screen. The bottom bezel (at least, the part that’s visible) is borderline nonexistent and gives you a noticeable amount of extra room when scrolling a web page or reading a document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfT7zZ"&gt;Vertical space aside, though, the screen is also phenomenal. It’s bright, maxing out at 444 nits, and vivid, covering 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, 86 percent of Adobe RGB, and 98 percent of P3. It’s significantly brighter than the G15’s screen, and the difference does show. Games and images were gorgeous to look at, with sharp colors and details, and the matte texture eliminates all glare even at low levels of brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FvHaSl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Where the G15 has a large and visible chin, the M16 just has more screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlowEW"&gt;The M16 also has a slight advantage as an Intel system in that it can support Thunderbolt 4. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port in addition to a Type-C, a power port, an Ethernet jack, a headphone jack, an HDMI, and a USB-A port on the left and a microSD slot, a lock slot, and a USB-A on the right. It’s a good selection, though I wish the ports were more evenly distributed — seven of the 10 are on the left side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnQr9e"&gt;The M16 has one other feature that’s unique among the recent Zephyrus line: a webcam. Yes, there is a webcam! Both the G15 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702219/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2021-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the G14&lt;/a&gt; lack this feature, and I’m really not sure why — while not everyone needs one, it would make both laptops more attractive purchases for anyone like me who’s often on video calls. The M16’s 720p camera isn’t great, but it’s not terrible, and that’s saying a lot for a laptop webcam. I was fairly clear on Zoom calls, and the noise-canceling microphones did a fine job of picking up my voice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9xIM7NG_mzhvz_LPEYEM6iI0yk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810026/akrales_210824_4725_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right: power port, HDMI 2.0b, RJ45, USB-A, Type-C with Thunderbolt 4, Type-C, combo audio jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ports on the right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cykyhIY3G9xI0Al7I_RE66y0WGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810023/akrales_210824_4725_0067.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left: Kensington lock, microSD (312MB/s), USB-A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aroa02"&gt;But the M16 doesn’t hold up to its AMD counterpart in most other areas — and unfortunately, gaming is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CySMQ"&gt;The M16 averaged 236fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, meaning it will take full advantage of the 165Hz screen on easier esports titles. But it had more trouble on AAA games. It averaged 46fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultra preset (55fps with DLSS on “Quality,” 48fps in 1440p) and 42fps with all sliders maxed. On &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s highest preset, the M16 averaged 38fps with ray tracing on Ultra (46fps with DLSS on, 40fps in 1440p) and 63fps with ray tracing off (68fps in 1440p). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VZHCWO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, there is a webcam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XIyMRr"&gt;Those results look reasonable — until you compare them to the G15. The AMD-powered machine that we tested is the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMTE5VRmOS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exact same price&lt;/a&gt; as this M16 unit, but it has a GeForce RTX 3070. That’s technically only one step up from the RTX 3060, but these numbers illustrate how big that step is. The G15 (at 2560 x 1440) got 58fps on&lt;em&gt; Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; on Ultra, 61fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing on, and 81fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing off. That’s a sound drubbing from an identically priced unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JO8gCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10807200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtqscF"&gt;In fact, these results are closer to those we saw from the G14 (which has the same GPU as this M16 model but in a much smaller chassis). The M16 is beating that model by fewer than 10fps on both &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. (That device also isn’t the best value — with just a 120Hz display, it’s currently going for &lt;a href="https://www.excaliberpc.com/768172/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-ga401qm-211.zg14b.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 less than this M16&lt;/a&gt;.) Overall, I don’t see much reason to buy the M16 over the G15 that’s exactly the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6US73"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Six hours isn’t a great result for a laptop that’s supposed to be able to double as a primary driver&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvpaPZ"&gt;Battery life didn’t help the M16’s case. The G15 and the G14 both basically never die, but I was averaging just under six and a half hours from using the M16 as my daily work driver with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s a couple hours shorter than what I averaged on the G15 and only a bit more than what we saw from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22723299/razer-blade-15-advanced-late-2021-review-specs-features-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same GPU but a much smaller battery. Intra-Asus comparisons aside, six hours isn’t a great result for a laptop that’s supposed to be able to double as a primary driver when needed (which is the primary benefit of the 16:10 screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKvRXi"&gt;Battery gaming wasn’t much better. I only got 57 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; play out of one charge, where I got an hour and 21 minutes out of the G15. The experience wasn’t great either: the game began stuttering around 22 minutes in and became unplayable (with crackling and distorted audio) at 42 minutes in with 20 percent remaining. The M16’s battery is the same size as the G15’s (90Wh) and it has a weaker GPU, so this looks like it’s on Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgHAHn"&gt;Charging was also a bit slow. The 240W charger took 50 minutes to juice the device up to 60 percent with light Chrome use. (The M16 also supports 100W Type-C charging, but that will be even slower.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The dot matrix on the lower left corner of the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16’s lid." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2oF4OdlOBok8EHSJtxQTiD5vZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810019/akrales_210824_4725_0029.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No little LEDs here, as there are on some G14 models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The power button on the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSxr59yy5sV2OA62xqfz2qioSB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810024/akrales_210824_4725_0079.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a fingerprint sensor in the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N1CzRo"&gt;Raw performance isn’t the only place where the M16 struggled to keep up. The cooling system is also very loud — even among gaming laptops. The G15’s fans never drowned out my games’ audio, but I really struggled to hear the speakers over the M16’s noise. They were also pretty obtrusive, even when I was just working in Chrome. You’ll want to turn on Silent mode if you’re not gaming. (To Asus’ credit, the fans were effective — I rarely saw the CPU pass 80 degrees Celsius, and it was often in the mid-70s or high 60s during benchmark runs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z60qnK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Charging was a bit slow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8L2kHu"&gt;It didn’t help that the M16’s speakers (two tweeters and two force-canceling woofers) aren’t super loud. Vocals were clear and songs well-balanced, but they didn’t fill my studio apartment, and I sometimes found myself having to lean forward to hear while I was trying to watch YouTube videos, even with volume maxed out. You can use Dolby Access to jump between equalizer presets for gaming, movies, music, and voice calls — the gaming and movies profiles sound a bit tinny on these speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 open, seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSfMFqPC6iXhChYNWjAHFu9dY64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810022/akrales_210824_4725_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Arc Flow fans have 84 blades as thin as 0.2mm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zs48DF"&gt;Everything else about the M16 is standard Zephyrus stuff. It’s the exact same weight and almost the same thickness as the G15, at 4.19 pounds and 0.75 inches —  portable as 15-inch gaming rigs go. It’s got the familiar dot matrix covering its lid and Asus’ signature ErgoLift hinge that folds beneath the screen and raises the keyboard up slightly (hiding much of the bottom bezel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EkaXP"&gt;The keyboard is great, and the touchpad is massive, with a smooth surface and a very easy click. I did occasionally have palm-rejection issues — the cursor jumped pretty much whenever my palm hit the touchpad. This got bothersome enough that I ended up turning off touchpad input when I was playing games with external peripherals. But overall, it’s an excellent chassis that’s sturdy and sleek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="YPycUG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10807214"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fz8dPW"&gt;In a vacuum, there’s nothing particularly objectionable about the Zephyrus M16. The exceptional 16:10 display and the, well, existence of a webcam are great additions — and they make the M16 more pragmatic as a primary work driver than other gaming laptops in its class. The addition of Thunderbolt and Intel-specific features like Quick Sync will be icing on the cake for creative professionals who won’t be able to find those benefits in an AMD system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQJxZX"&gt;However, the M16 is still a Zephyrus. It’s not intended to be a primary work driver or for coffee-shop creatives; it is, first and foremost, a gaming laptop. And it’s too expensive for its performance. It provides a weaker GPU, worse battery life, and a significantly worse battery-gaming experience than comparably priced AMD systems. You’re paying for this webcam and incredible screen not only with extra money but also with frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XFoDp9"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s no audience for the M16. The screen, the upgraded ports, and the webcam aren’t trivial bonuses. The M16 isn’t a bad laptop, but most gamers will be happier with the G15 — and I wish Asus would put this screen and this webcam on that product.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now sign up to buy Spotify’s Car Thing, but you probably shouldn’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tkTQilLDwQ6Qi2KQ8M1YhbkLASM=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69995451/acarman_20210412_4524_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dio3OF"&gt;Spotify is making it easier to get ahold of &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-13/spotify-launches-our-newest-exploration-a-limited-release-of-car-thing-a-smart-player-for-your-car/"&gt;its first hardware device, the Car Thing&lt;/a&gt;, by opening up &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-14/5-things-to-know-about-the-newest-limited-release-of-car-thing/"&gt;a waitlist to purchase the device&lt;/a&gt; that anyone can join starting today. The catch is that now the streaming service’s previously invite-only product is $79.99 when it used to be free with paid shipping and handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cut30D"&gt;While Spotify will let anyone with an account sign up for its waitlist, whether free or premium, you do still need a premium account to actually use the device. Also, at its new $79.99 price, it’s worth re-examining what the Car Thing can do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFfou4ECRJysy5XRDzDYq5t89hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439218/carthing1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Car Thing comes with a selection of mounts for your car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjW14S"&gt;The Car Thing is not a standalone Spotify device. It connects to your phone over Bluetooth and uses a phone’s internet connection to stream and control playback on songs and podcasts from Spotify’s library. The Car Thing is also totally reliant on your phone’s Bluetooth, USB, or auxiliary cable connection to your car, which basically makes the device a glorified Spotify remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9gswN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380014/spotify-car-thing-release-voice-control-data-interactive-ads"&gt;In our hands-on with the Car Thing&lt;/a&gt;, the included voice controls (“Hey Spotify) were helpful, but that might not matter if your built-in stereo does the same thing. The Car Thing is just limited — even though Spotify plans to update it — and it’s no longer “free.” I’d recommend really considering whether it’s worth it before you sign up to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdWoWc"&gt;You can join Spotify’s Car Thing waitlist &lt;a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/"&gt;on the company’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making it easier to doomscroll through search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OPMgJCEGAT9f4y_LO2MlEtXmwJ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69995368/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IjUwPT"&gt;Google is making it easier to doomscroll through search results by automatically loading newer results as you get to the end of the page. Previously, when you got to the end of a page of Google search results, there was a big “See more” button at the bottom you could tap to, well, see more results. With continuously loaded results, you’ll be able to just keep on scrolling to see more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WqGkOA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beginning today, continuous scrolling is starting to roll out to Google Search for most English searches on mobile devices in the US. Learn more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ulPL0EaKV0"&gt;https://t.co/ulPL0EaKV0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/W0iwL3fdy6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/W0iwL3fdy6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1448707950281854982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sij3lI"&gt;Continuous scrolling does have some advantages; it’s a lot easier to see more results quickly if you don’t have to consciously make a choice to tap the “See more” button. I can’t say I’m looking forward to this change, though, since reaching the end of a Google search page was often a natural place for me to consider if I had learned enough or if I wanted to seek out more information. With continuous scrolling, it might be harder for me to pull myself away from the page, which is something I already struggle with while using social networks with endlessly loading feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmZmre"&gt;Continuous scrolling is starting to “gradually” roll out Thursday for “most English searches on mobile in the US,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/continuous-scrolling-mobile/"&gt;according to a Google blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genie Plus lets you skip lines at Disney World, but fans aren’t happy about it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BIZ-DISNEY-50TH-CELEBRATION-2-OS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nR9iyFi9klPfHlFGtbzsNilB9lQ=/0x79:3000x2079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69995047/1235633497.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fq0zd8"&gt;Walt Disney World is offering yet another way to make your experience more magical (or more miserable, depending on how you look at it). Set to launch on October 19th, Disney’s Genie service will grant you a number of wishes, including the ability to skip lines — once you pay up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disney Genie app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O8ADKjara2liRuo66PQ-6ADUQVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926907/disney_genie_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SzwSK9"&gt;Disney first introduced the service in an August &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, noting that you’ll be able to access the Disney Genie service through the My Disney Experience and Disneyland apps. The Disney Genie will serve as your personal trip planner and, if you choose the paid option, will let you jump to the front of your favorite rides’ lines via the Lightning Lane entrances. The only caveat is that you can only choose one ride at a time. While this sounds like a handy service to have, it’s the added cost for the Genie Plus that Disney goers aren’t happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDwlQe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disney Genie Plus is a paid replacement for the old, free FastPass system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FpZJdd"&gt;Both the free and paid versions of the Genie service provide tailored recommendations for dining options, events, and attractions. Simply tell the service what you want to do at Disney, and it will give you personalized results. It also gives you information on how long the wait may be for certain attractions, as well as provides scheduling suggestions to help you beat the crowds. When you start to solidify your plans, you can use the service to browse through your daily schedule, which might include reservations for restaurants, hotels, and specific events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rm1CSH"&gt;If you only want to use the above features, the Genie will prove to be convenient and very useful. The line-skipping perk, however, comes with a price that some might not be willing to pay. The paid Disney Genie Plus service will cost $15 per ticket per day at Walt Disney World, and $20 per ticket per day at Disneyland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJY5RU"&gt;And if you don’t want to use Disney Genie Plus at all, you’ll have to purchase Lightning Lane passes for a very limited selection of individual rides. To make matters even more confusing, those individual rides aren’t even included with Genie Plus. This means you’ll be stuck paying another fee in addition to Genie Plus if you want to experience attractions like Space Mountain or Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iErUBO"&gt;Disney guests clearly aren’t happy about the change — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fP50klEPE"&gt;Disney’s announcement video&lt;/a&gt; for the Genie service has a telling 12,000 dislikes compared to 956 likes. The outrage mainly comes from the fact that the FastPass and FastPass Plus, Disney’s line-skipping services that will be imminently phased out, were free to use. Although you didn’t have much control over the specifics of your ride schedule, it still helped you avoid standing in a queue for hours, free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNtF71"&gt;Right now, the only benefit to the Disney Genie Plus service is that it’s supposed to give you a better chance of getting on the more popular rides. Even still, adding the cost of the Genie Plus service on top of pricey tickets, hotel stays, and restaurants visits isn’t really fair to guests. Who knows, if people aren’t satisfied with their Disney Genie experience, maybe we’ll see more people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679895/florida-man-hollywood-studios-skips-lines-disney-employee-ipad-app"&gt;hijacking employees’ iPads so they can skip lines using some of their own magic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo’s autonomous vehicles keep getting stuck in a dead-end street in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Waymo Self Driving Car" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjujG2y3w-BUkvV5-fPMpLmk6IM=/0x2:5195x3465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994905/1324922564.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HovVJ4"&gt;Traffic is hell, but what if the cars clogging up the roadways are all robots? That’s what some residents on one quiet street in San Francisco have discovered, with a seemingly endless parade of autonomous vehicles from Waymo driving down a dead-end street in the city’s residential Richmond district, turning around, and driving away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrvh2Y"&gt;“There are some days where it can be up to 50,” resident Jennifer King told &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/10/14/dead-end-sf-street-plagued-with-confused-waymo-cars-trying-to-turn-around-every-5-minutes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KPIX 5 &lt;/em&gt;in this hilarious scene report&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s literally every five minutes. And we’re all working from home, so this is what we hear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zh2dtg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are some days where it can be up to 50”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KDKJ3w"&gt;Residents are confused as to why the Waymo vehicles — Jaguar I-Pace SUVs with rooftop sensors and high-tech compute systems inside — keep coming, one after the other, sometimes two or three at a time. They aren’t picking up or dropping off customers, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639226/waymo-san-francisco-rides-self-driving-service"&gt;Waymo recently announcing&lt;/a&gt; that it was going to start shuttling passengers around San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ozRI7S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A normally quiet neighborhood in San Francisco is buzzing about a sudden explosion of traffic. Neighbors say their Richmond District dead-end street has suddenly become crowded with WayMo vehicles. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rD0iXmmL29"&gt;https://t.co/rD0iXmmL29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— KPIX 5 (@KPIXtv) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KPIXtv/status/1448320899137081347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i2q8Zt"&gt;A spokesperson for Waymo chalked it up to one of the nearby presence of one of the city’s Slow Streets, in which vehicle traffic is limited through certain residential areas. As noted in the &lt;em&gt;KPIX 5&lt;/em&gt; video, the street the Waymo vehicles keep turning down is adjacent to one of these Slow Streets. ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kp7Wl"&gt;“We continually adjust to dynamic San Francisco road rules,” the spokesperson said. “In this case, cars traveling North of California on 15th Ave have to take a u-turn due to the presence of Slow Streets signage on Lake. So, the Waymo Driver was obeying the same road rules that any car is required to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AKStfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We continually adjust to dynamic San Francisco road rules”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCz9s1"&gt;As someone who covers the AV industry, I could also speculate about the need for companies to train their vehicle’s artificial intelligence software in all the elements of human driving, including messy maneuvers like the dreaded three-point turn. But I’m really just having too much fun watching these confused robot cars pile into this dead-end street over and over again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxdYrl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436584/waymo-driverless-stuck-traffic-roadside-assistance-video"&gt;It called to mind a recent event in Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, in which a fully driverless Waymo vehicle got stuck at an intersection and then, when an extraction crew showed up, tried to run away before completely blocking a three-lane highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aydzNj"&gt;The obvious difference is that Waymo is still using safety drivers for its tests in San Francisco. In the video, you can see Waymo’s safety drivers turning the steering wheels, which suggests that the vehicles haven’t quite mastered the turn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bybIqy"&gt;The incident is garnering some unwanted attention, including from one guy who runs a car company that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota"&gt;under investigation for numerous crashes involving stopped emergency vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;really shouldn’t be gloating about things like this. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SMRbV4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="tl" dir="ltr"&gt;Haha&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1448681402917138442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iek7N4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 14th, 2:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Waymo spokesperson responded with a statement after this story published.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nanoleaf’s latest smart lights are more nightclub than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6ll8DjvA728MqIz9GcVhVbt4yo=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994776/Lines_36x_Entertainment_Room_AngledWall_4000x2250px__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Lines is the latest product from the smart lighting company.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pmkTB0"&gt;First, there were triangles; then there were squares. Next came hexagons, and now, say hello to lines. No, this isn't your sixth grader’s geometry homework. It’s the latest addition to smart lighting maker Nanoleaf’s ever-growing catalog of modular LED light panels. The new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fnanoleaf-lines%2F%3Futm_source%3DGeneral%26utm_medium%3Dlinesnanoleaf%26utm_campaign%3Dlinesnanoleaf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22725220%2Fnanoleaf-lines-modular-smart-lighting-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nanoleaf Lines&lt;/a&gt; are ultra-lightweight, color-changing lights in a bar shape. Backlit, they connect at 60-degree angles to create geometric designs of your choosing, and with dual-color zones, the Lines ($199.99) can add a visual feast to any wall or ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSS0GO"&gt;As with Nanoleaf’s Shapes, Canvas, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Elements wall panels&lt;/a&gt;, Lines can be installed using pre-affixed, double-sided tape, making it an easy setup — although you’ll want to plan your design before committing. Powered by a large plug with a 14.7 foot cable, each Line emits 20 lumens, has a color temperature range of 1200K to 6500K, and can display more than 16 million colors. You can link up to 18 Lines per power supply, and control them with the Nanoleaf app, an on-device remote, or voice control using a compatible voice assistant. The Lines only work with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi networks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jC1e9F72O_wUHs8WLv53Q59j0Ws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926324/Lines_66x_CeilingMounted_4000x2250px.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Lines are modular light panels that can be mounted on the wall or ceiling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GzhVfs"&gt;Nanoleaf provides 19 pre-set dynamic RGBW lighting scenes (meaning they shift colors) in the app, or you can create your own to add ambiance to a home theater or enhance your favorite chill-out space. The Lines also work with Nanoleaf’s music visualization technology to sync with songs in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZrFH6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nanoleaf’s entire smart lighting line is compatible with Apple HomeKit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIna6y"&gt;Unlike the recent Elements panels, which are suited to more traditional home decor, the Lines have a very futuristic vibe, and honestly seem tailor-made for YouTuber backgrounds. The backlit look is also a departure from the other shapes, which project light outwards, not back toward the wall. This product line also seems designed with the gamer in mind; especially as the Lines integrates with Nanoleaf’s screen mirror feature to sync your lights with on-screen colors and animations. This requires the Nanoleaf desktop app, but can also work with a TV using an HDMI connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt9209"&gt;Nanoleaf’s entire smart lighting line is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT, allowing you to control, dim, and change designs with voice commands or through a smart home routine. Plus, as with its current lighting panels, Nanoleaf’s Lines can act as a Thread border router to connect its Essentials line of bulbs and light strips to your network without a third-party hub. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4tgaIfev0vQ5Ep6nvwxPBKrC3OY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926333/Lines_9x_Option_2_Bedroom_desk_4000x2250.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screen mirror feature can sync the colors in Nanoleaf Lines to your computer screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D9tjBz"&gt;Eventually, Nanoleaf says any Thread-enabled device will connect to a Thread network using a Nanoleaf border router. Thread is a key technology in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to unite smart home devices and platforms and allow for more interoperability. Nanoleaf says Lines have been designed with “Matter in mind” and will work with the new standard via a software update next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQcYc7"&gt;Nanoleaf Lines is available for pre-order on October 14th from &lt;a href="http://go.nanoleaf.me"&gt;Nanoleaf’s website&lt;/a&gt; and Best Buy. Smarter Kits (9 Lines) are $199.99, and Expansion Packs (3 Lines) are $79.99. Black and pink skins to customize the look of the front of the Lines, and flex connectors to bed around corners are coming later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawmakers want to strip legal protections from the Facebook News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Whistleblower Frances Haugen Testifies Before Senate Commerce Subcommittee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQTVEv39d3J8fS3RWW8-y9j9j1M=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994746/1235715609.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oeolxy"&gt;Democratic lawmakers want social networks to face legal liability if they recommend harmful content to users. Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), Mike Doyle (D-PA), and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) introduced the “Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act,” which would amend Section 230’s protections to exclude “personalized recommendations” for content that contributes to physical or severe emotional injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXEBId"&gt;The bill follows a recommendation Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/algorithms-shouldnt-be-protected-by-section-230-facebook-whistleblower-tells-senate/"&gt;made before Congress last week&lt;/a&gt;. Haugen, a former employee who leaked extensive internal Facebook research, encouraged lawmakers to crack down on algorithms that promote, rank, or otherwise order content based on user engagement. It applies to web services with over 5 million monthly visitors and excludes certain categories of material, including infrastructure services like web hosting and systems that return search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sK89d8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill doesn’t apply to very small services or search rankings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D5XYjE"&gt;For platforms that are covered, the bill targets Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which prevents people from suing web services over third-party content that users post. The new exception would let these cases proceed if the services knowingly or recklessly used a “personalized algorithm” to recommend the third-party content in question. That could include posts, groups, accounts, and other user-provided info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIEoX3"&gt;The bill wouldn’t necessarily let people sue over the kinds of material Haugen criticized, which include hate speech and anorexia-related content. Much of that material is legal in the United States, so platforms don’t need an additional liability shield for hosting it. (A Pallone statement &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/14/top-democrats-unveil-bill-rein-tech-companies-malicious-algorithms"&gt;also castigated sites&lt;/a&gt; for promoting “extremism” and “disinformation,” which aren’t necessarily illegal either.) The bill also only covers &lt;em&gt;personalized&lt;/em&gt; recommendations, defined as sorting content with an algorithm that “relies on information specific to an individual.” Companies could seemingly still use large-scale analytics to recommend the most popular general content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlIUqF"&gt;In her testimony, Haugen suggested that the goal was to add general legal risk until Facebook and similar companies stopped using personalized recommendations altogether. “If we reformed [Section] 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intentional ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement-based ranking,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose headphones and Apple iPhone accessories are on sale today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bose QuietComfort 35" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFa9sV6MwJK-8ixh2-6yCYbBbYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994166/theverge10_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The popular Bose QC35 II headphones are just one of many great deals today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c8qrAq"&gt;There are many great deals to be had today, especially if you enjoy a variety of options to browse and online window-shop. Amazon’s highlighted daily sale, currently coined as Epic Daily Deals, has several Bose headphones and earbuds discounted. There is a little bit for everyone here, ranging from the popular mainstay QuietComfort 35 II Bluetooth headphones and its gaming-accessorized counterpart to noise-canceling and sport-focused earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vS7NSQ"&gt;First, let’s dive into the QC35 II. These noise-canceling headphones became the industry standard for folks wanting comfortable and lightweight everyday headphones, especially for commuting and traveling on planes where the ANC can be most effective. There is a new model that just came out, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;Bose QC45&lt;/a&gt;, so the QC35 II may be phased out at some point, but the time is ripe for discounts. Amazon’s daily deal price on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the QC35 II for today is $249&lt;/a&gt;, saving $50 off its usual $300 price and a full $80 cheaper than the brand new model that succeeds it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wVotej"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLKakm"&gt;If you want to keep using your commuter headphones once you’re home, you can also score the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DVCNYJC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QC35 II in its gaming-adorned load-out for just $279&lt;/a&gt; — that same $50 discount. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439699/bose-quiet-comfort-35-ii-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-pc-bluetooth-price"&gt;QuietComfort 35 II Gaming Headset is the same set of cans&lt;/a&gt; but with an attachable mic boom and USB controller for volume and monitoring adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tsOSMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFypL"&gt;If you’re not the full-size headphones type and prefer the convenience of earbuds or the flexibility of open-ear listening, there are even more options today. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sit at the top of these offerings, with active noise canceling that bests the AirPods Pro and takes the crown as the ANC champ. Just be aware that the bulky case makes these larger earbuds a bit less convenient to tote around. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Noise-Cancelling-Earbuds/dp/B08C4KWM9T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s sale price of $199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is the best price to date on these earbuds that launched at the tail end of 2020, with a significant savings of $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PoINHk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="G6U4Gf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HlVxM1"&gt;Capping off all these Bose sales at Amazon today, here is a lightning round of earbuds and open-ear options to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2DbRnW"&gt;The smaller, workout-focused Bose Sport Earbuds are IPX4 sweat and weather resistant and down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sport-Earbuds-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B08CJCTG6Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149 — a savings of $30&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zO6sdL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215281/base-sport-open-earbuds-ambient-noise-workout"&gt;Bose Sport Open Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; also offer the same environmental resistance without blocking your ear canal, keeping you aware of the general space around you. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sport-Open-Earbuds-Headphones/dp/B08VRLZGMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s price of $179 saves $20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5kT7IG"&gt;For a more stylish take on open-ear Bluetooth wireless listening, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Frames-Audio-Sunglasses-Black/dp/B07P7VVCDD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Frames Alto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Frames-Tempo-Sunglasses-Connectivity/dp/B08CZL53F3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Frames Tempo&lt;/a&gt; are discounted by $24 and $25, respectively. The Alto is the more fashion-focused everyday wear version, while the Tempo is better suited for an active lifestyle like cycling or running. Both keep your ears unblocked to keep you better in tune with your surroundings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="PNPQ7I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10806953"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="FFwYz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwy94m"&gt;Shifting from Bose deals to Apple accessories deals, AT&amp;amp;T’s online store is offering 15 percent discounts on myriad iPhone accessories. If you recently got a new iPhone, there might be an accessory for you here that is now on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axu7V5"&gt;Some notable highlights include the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/chargers/apple-20w-usb-c-power-adapter-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W USB-C fast charger&lt;/a&gt; for ensuring your iPhone gets topped up quicker, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/browse/all/apple_clear" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clear silicone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/browse/all/apple_works-with-magsafe_apple-new" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather cases&lt;/a&gt; for protecting the full iPhone 13 range, the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/specialty-items/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-midnight.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe leather wallet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/batteries/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/chargers/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Duo wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="5xgee1"&gt;OH, WE’RE NOT DONE HERE: A FEW MORE DEALS TO CHECK OUT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

The hilariously named Razer Homerun Gaming Bundle includes a Razer Kraken V3 X Gaming Headset, DeathAdder V2 Gaming Mouse, Ornata V2 Gaming Keyboard, and Gigantus V2 Mouse Pad. That’s a lot of RGB for 80 bucks. Perfect for jumping all-in on Razer peripherals or for gifting to the mad gaming lad in your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kWiyGF"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are still available from &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F%3D%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkBX8bWR1ykOzY0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_10451%26clickid%3D0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkBX8bWR1ykOzY0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D567111%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals101421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $180&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The $499 HTC Vive Flow is VR for people who don’t like VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rlMtg6aNshLqJE1H4W9Rbo9axKs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994113/akrales_211005_4774_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;HTC wants to find a new VR market — but what is it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3k75EG"&gt;After years of focusing on business-oriented virtual reality, HTC is launching a $499 entertainment-focused headset called the Vive Flow in November, with preorders starting globally today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px43Xw"&gt;The new Vive Flow looks radically different from most HTC Vive devices. It’s a standalone piece of hardware modeled after a pair of sunglasses, and at first glance it could pass for an &lt;em&gt;augmented&lt;/em&gt; reality headset, not just a VR one. But behind those slightly bug-eyed mirror shades, you’ll find a lighter version of earlier Vive headsets — minus some major features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssvVAYZB2p5r_er-wSMldIKiKZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908700/akrales_211005_4774_0376.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vive Flow features focus dials on the inside of the headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Pe4G"&gt;The Vive Flow, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721337/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-vivport-verse-metaverse"&gt;leaked heavily&lt;/a&gt; before HTC’s reveal today, is a compromise between capability and approachability. The device has a 1.6K-per-eye display (HTC didn’t provide the exact resolution) with a 100-degree field of view at a 75Hz refresh rate. That’s a little more limited than the 120 degrees and 90Hz rate that you’ll find on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588917/htc-vive-focus-3-vr-headset-review"&gt;the more costly Vive Focus 3&lt;/a&gt; and roughly the same refresh rate but a lower field of view than the original Quest. It’s also slightly comparable to the Oculus Quest’s refresh rate before a recent upgrade and a little more cramped than its 110-degree field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S33DQB"&gt;Two front-facing cameras handle inside-out motion tracking, and HTC plans to support hand tracking as well, although the feature wasn’t available during a pre-launch demo and didn’t give an exact timeline for its rollout. It’s using the last-generation Qualcomm XR1 chipset (as opposed to the Quest 2’s XR2), and it’s got a respectable 64GB of storage space but — unlike the Focus 3 — no slot for an expansion card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpr4Du"&gt;Lightweight hardware is a big selling point for HTC. “We wanted to get to something lighter, more wearable, easier to travel with,” says Dan O’Brien, HTC’s head of VR. The Flow weighs 189 grams, compared to around 500 grams for the Oculus Quest 2, and has a hinged design that folds up to fit in a $49 carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6YmYLkj-8Iq2cieaGsGcbZn5uU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908694/akrales_211005_4774_0177.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lzT2mc"&gt;Unlike earlier Vive headsets, the Vive Flow won’t come with a controller. Instead, you connect the headset wirelessly to an Android smartphone and use the phone as a combination remote / touchpad. Similar to the mobile Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR remotes, it’s basically a virtual laser pointer with buttons for selecting items and calling up the homescreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vGX0j"&gt;Leaked photos showed the Flow plugged into a black box, which some people speculated might be an external computing device. It’s actually a $79 battery pack that should let you use the headset for four to five hours. The Flow technically has its own battery, but HTC says it only lasts a few minutes — it’s designed to let you swap power sources without turning off the headset. So you’ll need either the HTC battery, which is sold separately from the headset, or (according to HTC) any 10,000mAh power bank and a USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5McNzYw9hbRfK9ATk-Q5NJaITU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908698/akrales_211005_4774_0416.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxbJ23"&gt;In addition to controlling the device, the phone connection lets you mirror Android apps, calling up a virtual copy of your phone’s homescreen and letting you launch apps like streaming video services in a floating window. The headset doesn’t pair with iPhones, and while HTC hasn’t ruled out future support, it indicated there were serious barriers to making iOS play well with the Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SMTg7"&gt;HTC wants people to use the Vive Flow for visually immersive but mostly stationary experiences. So you can watch a 360-degree video or sit in a virtual environment, but you can’t use apps that require full-fledged virtual hands. (This rules out most well-known VR games.) The camera tracking gives you a more natural experience than a headset that can only detect the angle of your head, but the app catalog and the somewhat loose-fitting glasses-style design mean you probably won’t be walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7sC8p"&gt;HTC says the Flow will launch with 100 apps and support 150 by the end of the year. In addition to uses like streaming video, its release announcement promotes the Tripp meditation app and the VR therapeutic service MyndVR, which is tailored for older adults. You can also engage with VR social spaces like Vive Sync and watch streaming video, something that’s proven &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22700782/nreal-air-smart-ar-glasses-release-date-shipping-countries"&gt;popular on AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;. The Flow will support a limited subset of the apps on HTC’s Viveport store, and users can subscribe to a discounted, Flow-focused $5.99-per-month version of Viveport’s app subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGz8Ry"&gt;The Vive Flow seems basically pitched as a VR headset for people who find current VR headsets overcomplicated or intimidating. O’Brien describes the device as something that’s easy to put in a bag while traveling without worrying about extra pieces like controllers. “We wanted to make something that was super easy and flexible,” he says. Instead of directly competing with gaming-oriented headsets, HTC is trying to carve out a new category of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVU23f"&gt;HTC’s focus on older users (“the huge Boomer population,” as a MyndVR representative put it) is part of this strategy. So is the push for a glasses-like design instead of the straps you’ll find on most headsets. “There’s the user that really just wants this thing to be un-intimidating and easy to pop on and off,” O’Brien says — and that’s who the Flow is made for. The result has a lot in common with the now-discontinued Oculus Go, but with a svelter look and upgrades like the inside-out camera tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wlTPTDFi72KIwoa_nAtqX23_sRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908697/akrales_211005_4774_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a1SZAuNt51nupsEA-v40rkX1wWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908695/akrales_211005_4774_0043.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIh0gg"&gt;My brief experience with the Vive Flow was a mixed bag. The Flow is, in fact, remarkably light — presumably in part because HTC offloaded its battery. But without a strap system to keep the headset in place, the screen kept slipping down my face and blurring the top half of my VR experience. HTC plans to offer alternate swappable face gaskets for different fits, and one of them worked better than the original. But I still had to be careful while turning my head, and the feeling of carefully balancing the headset wasn’t exactly relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbPJBe"&gt;The Flow was exponentially more bearable than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/10/12405354/dlodlo-v1-virtual-reality-headset-sunglasses"&gt;earlier “glasses-style” VR headsets&lt;/a&gt; I’ve tried. It’s just still a lot more unsteady-feeling than the Focus 3, Quest, or practically any other major headset, and there’s no alternate strap option for people who want a more secure fit. There’s a diopter adjustment dial so you can change the focus on each eye individually, but like the Quest 2, you inconveniently can’t change the focus while you’re actually looking at an image — you have to take the headset off, twist the wheels a notch, and then put it back on again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L99GL"&gt;The smartphone-based controller, the Vive Flow’s biggest departure from standard VR design, is theoretically reasonable but practically awkward. I used an HTC-provided Android device that worked fine as a VR laser pointer. But thanks to the long-running trend of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus"&gt;ever-bigger phones&lt;/a&gt;, I could barely fit my hand around HTC’s phone to tap virtual buttons on the screen. It’s also a strange choice for any headset aimed at older users, who are &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/"&gt;dramatically less likely&lt;/a&gt; to own smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJlOfH0HqmI8pXjaQDT6Jw2Ml6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908699/akrales_211005_4774_0296.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A soft, swappable gasket sits between your face and the lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IgtrFT"&gt;Hand tracking could partly solve the interaction issue. But gesture interfaces remain frustratingly hit-or-miss and typically require holding your fingers up to perform fine motions, which also seems like a bad option if your hands have limited mobility, and I didn’t get to try HTC’s version in my demo. O’Brien says HTC is still toying with options for other control systems — its plan is to release the headset and then tweak its design based on how people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LVAy8"&gt;More generally, it’s not clear HTC’s emphasis on portability is the key to winning over VR doubters. Companies have been pitching “VR you can throw in your bag” for years now, and outside of people whose jobs involve headsets, I haven’t seen a single human being cite that as a selling point — while I’ve heard even skeptics praise bulkier headsets for being comfortable. HTC also says people will feel less awkward wearing this glasses-like design in public settings like airplanes. As someone who actually has worn a VR headset on an airplane, I’m not sure that’s enough to erase its fundamental weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EahLpo"&gt;There isn’t really a clear audience for the Flow in the US market. It’s far more expensive and less feature-rich than the Facebook-subsidized Oculus Quest 2 but without specialized features that might make it appealing for businesses or other organizations. (Film festivals and schools could use a no-frills VR headset for 360-degree video, for instance... but the Flow isn’t it.) HTC has designed social apps like Sync that could have relatively broad appeal. But outside its meditation and video options, my Flow demo didn’t offer a great sense of its day-to-day value. I found mostly small games that I might play occasionally, not tools I’d spend $499 to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5dpgpf"&gt;But HTC has built a strong base of VR business hardware, and for now, it seems content to release the Flow as an experiment. At the very least, you won’t find another major headset like it — even if it does make you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723442/htc-vive-pro-headset-leaked-photos-evan-blass-bug-look"&gt;sort of look like a bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
