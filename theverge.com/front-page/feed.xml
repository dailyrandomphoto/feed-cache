    <title>China returns sample of lunar dirt to Earth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k1wS06"&gt;China’s first mission to return a sample of dirt from the Moon just arrived back at Earth, with a container of lunar rocks in tow, &lt;a href="https://newsus.cgtn.com/news/2020-12-17/China-s-Chang-e-5-lunar-probe-successfully-returns-to-Earth-WhpHOUX5qU/index.html"&gt;China state media confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. A capsule of lunar material scraped up by a Chinese spacecraft landed this afternoon in a very snowy Inner Mongolia, after plunging through Earth’s atmosphere and parachuting to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gubLgV"&gt;The landing marks the end of China’s third whirlwind — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594565/china-change-5-mission-lunar-sample-return-long-march-5-launch"&gt;and incredibly complex&lt;/a&gt; — mission to the lunar surface, called Chang’e 5. The flight launched on November 23rd, sending a gaggle of four different robotic spacecraft to the Moon’s orbit. On December 1st, two of those spacecraft — a lander and an ascent vehicle — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21724067/china-lunar-mission-change-5-moon-soil-samples"&gt;touched down on the lunar surface&lt;/a&gt; in order to dig up samples of rocks from the ground. Once enough material had been collected, the ascent vehicle then blasted off of the Moon, carrying the samples to the rest of the spacecraft still in lunar orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2M2KX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The end of China’s third whirlwind mission to the lunar surface&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tpcsM9"&gt;That started the quick journey back to Earth. The ascent vehicle transferred the samples to the rest of the spacecraft, which set a course back to our planet. This afternoon, a reentry capsule with the samples inside broke away and headed for Earth. The capsule skipped off the atmosphere once before diving through it and landing on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rRfJgL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello there. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JbpmaOGGmZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JbpmaOGGmZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJ_FI/status/1339277873912418307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IMZoY7"&gt;The landing makes China the third country to return samples from the Moon to Earth, behind the United States and the former Soviet Union. In fact, the last time any country brought back samples from the Moon was in 1976, with the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 robotic mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1Dsy2"&gt;After the landing, Chinese officials located the capsule and will soon open it up in a lab to better understand the lunar haul. China hoped to gather up to 4 kilograms of space rocks from an unexplored part of the Moon called Oceanus Procellarum, or the “Ocean of Storms.” This region of the lunar surface is much smoother than other areas of the Moon, leading scientists to suspect that the rocks there have been smoothed out recently by volcanoes late in the Moon’s lifetime. Studying this material in a laboratory setting could give scientists a better understanding of the Moon’s evolution as well as the entire complex history of the Earth-Moon system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Project Kuiper reveals design of antennas customers will use for internet-from-space constellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxL-3ImHlNmZMxGd96nYL5khFec=/48x0:966x612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524569/Project_Kuiper_Customer_Terminal_Antenna_Graphic__2_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A graphic showing the design of Amazon’s user antenna&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9L3cjs"&gt;Today, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development"&gt;revealed the design&lt;/a&gt; of the antennas its customers will use to tap into the company’s upcoming massive satellite constellation, Project Kuiper, designed to provide broadband internet coverage from space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMcYjU"&gt;The antenna, which is a phased-array design, underwent development and testing this fall, according to the company. With a diameter of just 12 inches across, the antenna is “smaller and lighter than legacy antenna designs,” Amazon claims. Testing showed the antenna can provide “maximum throughput of up to 400 Mbps.” The company also notes that the antenna can be used to stream 4K-quality videos from geostationary satellites, spacecraft that are located about 22,000 miles above the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="14TKz9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Testing showed the antenna can provide “maximum throughput of up to 400 Mbps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jayeTv"&gt;Amazon Kuiper’s satellites will be much closer to Earth, though. In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;Amazon received approval from the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; to launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites for Project Kuiper, with the spacecraft flying at altitudes ranging from 590 kilometers, or 366 miles, to 630 kilometers, or 391 miles. With so many satellites orbiting close to Earth, Project Kuiper aims to beam low-latency, broadband internet coverage to individual users on the planet below. The goal is to provide coverage to remote areas and regions that do not have access to traditional high-speed internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VttFsmYgCEj7XUHI8A_iDqvcUpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174953/Project_Kuiper_Customer_Terminal_Antenna__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Kuiper engineers testing the Ka-band phased array antenna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="90BPnV"&gt;Amazon is one of a number of companies focused on launching a massive internet-from-space constellation. Notably, SpaceX is eyeing the same goal with its Starlink initiative, a proposed constellation of nearly 12,000 satellites that will also provide broadband internet from low to medium Earth orbits. SpaceX has already launched nearly 1,000 of its Starlink satellites and has even begun initial beta testing, providing select customers with at-home antennas to tap into the satellites and receive internet coverage. Amazon has yet to launch any satellites, nor has the company revealed on which rocket the satellites will launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rcv17J"&gt;Amazon argues that by making its user terminals smaller, it will reduce the cost of making the hardware as well as lower the price point for customers to opt into the program. The company claims it was able to go small by overlaying “tiny antenna element structures” over one another. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25ajzFXkY2eH4AkITv9vk-wPDnI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174971/Project_Kuiper_Customer_Terminal_Antenna__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antenna testing at Project Kuiper HQ in Redmond, Washington.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W814yS"&gt;“If you want to make a difference for unserved and underserved communities, you need to deliver service at a price that makes sense for customers,” Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development"&gt;said in an Amazon blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. “This simple fact inspired one of our key tenets for Kuiper: to invent a light, compact phased array antenna that would allow us to produce an affordable customer terminal. It’s incredible to see such a small form factor delivering this type of speed and performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLVdDD"&gt;The 12-inch diameter makes the Amazon antenna much smaller than the Starlink antenna based on photos of the SpaceX user terminals that beta-testers have posted to Reddit. To test out SpaceX’s Starlink hardware, beta-testers had to pay an upfront cost of $499 for all of the equipment and then an additional $99 a month. Amazon has not revealed its prices for Project Kuiper, but the company did vow to invest $10 billion into the program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest overhauls harassment policy following discrimination complaints</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pinterest Takes Stock Public On New York Stock Exchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HcO9rchE3xfDa7IHKyE8n-fcYKw=/0x1734:4160x4507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524214/1143514577.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sSkgF0"&gt;A five-month investigation into Pinterest’s company culture published on Wednesday recommends broad changes to how the firm handles workplace conflicts, including harassment and retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAeZzJ"&gt;Produced by the law firm WilmerHale, the report details how the company can improve its workplace conditions and prevent discrimination, specifically recommending the creation of an internal ombudsman’s office that can field employee complaints. The law firm spoke with 350 current and former Pinterest employees over the course of its five-month investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc2TYi"&gt;Pinterest’s board has already unanimously voted to adopt the recommendations, which were shared with employees on Wednesday and &lt;a href="https://www.pinterest-assets.com/m/137b577c199a60d3/original/Special-Committee-Communication-and-Recommendations-for-Pinterest.pdf"&gt;posted publicly on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCJOqb"&gt;In recent months, a number of Pinterest employees have come forward with complaints about the company’s culture, some of which have led to lawsuits against the company. Earlier this week, Pinterest settled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;a gender discrimination lawsuit with former COO Franćoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt;, paying $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys as well as an additional $2.5 million to philanthropies supporting underrepresented groups in tech. In part, WilmerHale’s recommendations are likely intended to forestall future litigation and limit Pinterest’s liability from any complaints that emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nYPr4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It refers obliquely to allegations made by Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VITpuZ"&gt;The report begins with a section titled “How We Got Here.” It refers obliquely to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;allegations made by two employees&lt;/a&gt;, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, who previously worked on Pinterest’s policy team. In June, both women spoke out about racism and sexism at the company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2A0Kr"&gt;Pinterest should establish a centralized workplace investigations team to follow up on employee complaints, the report says. “It is critical that investigations of workplace concerns are thorough, follow clear and standardized procedures, and are conducted with empathy and care,” it adds. “This includes, for example, promptly responding to employees when they file a complaint, investigating as confidentially as possible, and emphasizing, in communications during an investigation, Pinterest’s prohibition against retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n8W0C6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report calls for an “escalations team” to investigate particularly sensitive issues &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BkVCmK"&gt;The report also recommends that Pinterest’s process for disciplining employees should be consistent: “Pinterest should formalize its existing calibrations practice so that investigators are recommending similar outcomes for similar conduct across the Company and, specifically, that its policies and standards apply equally to all members of the Pinterest community, including managers and Senior Leaders.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99bxH5"&gt;Additionally, the report calls for an “escalations team” to investigate particularly sensitive issues raised by employees. “Pinterest should also revise its escalation protocol to clarify which cases should be promptly escalated and to whom — such as the General Counsel, Chief Human Resources Officer, members of the Executive Leadership Team, or the Board — regardless of whether they warrant investigation by outside counsel or an independent investigator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gd6M73"&gt;Another recommendation calls attention to Pinterest’s lack of a standalone drugs and alcohol policy that would dictate employee conduct at work events. Such a policy should enforce managerial behavior around making employees who don’t drink feel comfortable at work events in the presence of alcohol and also emphasize that alcohol does not excuse employee misconduct, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHt227"&gt;Notably, the report says Pinterest needs to “address off-site conduct,” meaning that any policy changes going forward need to take into account any behaviors that may “impact working relationships and the broader working environment, regardless of where it occurs (including on social media).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0lwei"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Pinterest spokesperson said: “Pinterest is fully committed to making the changes recommended by the Special Committee of the Board. We value our employees and know it’s our responsibility to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone at Pinterest.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GOG walks back release of controversial horror game Devotion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_0zSoJN1h-_Pnusaw6wZVdRgg4=/176x0:1952x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68523648/Screen_Shot_2020_12_16_at_11.52.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pX4XzU"&gt;Hours after announcing it would bring controversial horror game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236099/devotion-horror-game-steam-twitch-red-candle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to its platform, CD Projekt Red’s digital storefront GOG has reneged on its release plans. The company’s social media account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that “after receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhGEHG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; has been at the center of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239937/taiwanese-horror-game-devotion-gone-steam-removed-winnie-the-pooh-meme-china"&gt;censorship controversy&lt;/a&gt; since release last year, after players found in-game content that referred to Xi Jinping, the president of China, as a “Winnie-the-Pooh moron.” The Chinese leader is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/8/4/17651630/christopher-robin-banned-in-china-pooh"&gt;notoriously sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to the cartoon bear, to which memers have continuously compared him; the movie &lt;em&gt;Christopher Robin &lt;/em&gt;did not get a Chinese release. Mentions of comedian John Oliver were outright censored on social media after a segment that mentioned the Winnie the Pooh comparisons. Players review-bombed the game, and the developer pulled it from Steam shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KjV7CO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“after receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cC4ri"&gt;At the time, Taiwanese developer Red Candle Games issued several apologies, first claiming that they’d pulled the game due to a &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1006510/discussions/0/1796278072845376475/"&gt;QA check&lt;/a&gt;, and that the art’s inclusion &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1006510/announcements/detail/1769256475090574891"&gt;was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;. The developer &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1006510/announcements/detail/1769256475103741408"&gt;later addressed&lt;/a&gt; the art in question more thoroughly. “We failed our players’ anticipation and offended many others due to the said mistake,” Red Candle Games wrote on Steam. “For that, we feel awfully sorry and devastated ... Red Candle Games take full responsibility and bear all the condemns. We sincerely hope that this end with Red Candle, and that please do not take it out on all the innocent partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQCEER"&gt;In the months following, &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; struggled to find a new home. In a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/15/20694744/devotion-red-candle-games-controversy-update-statement-re-release"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; printed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;, Red Candle Games said that “in the aftermath of the incident, some still possess different speculations about &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt;. As regretful as the incident was, we have to bear its full consequence. We hope for a second chance in the near future. A chance to prove that, both Red Candle and its partner simply wanted to create a great game and no one wished for such incident to occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR20Y7"&gt;It’s been a busy news cycle for CD Projekt Red — better known as a developer than for its PC storefront — over the past week. The studio’s highly anticipated release &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;plagued with technical issues&lt;/a&gt; and demands for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176279/cyberpunk-2077-performance-issues-refunds-microsoft-sony-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;refunds&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, GOG is notorious for posting &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-account-publishes-yet-another-awful-tweet-1829939458"&gt;insensitive material on social media&lt;/a&gt;, in keeping with CD Projekt Red’s habit of appealing to an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22058784/cyberpunk-2077-marketing-cd-projekt-red-transphobia"&gt;edgy fan base&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxaRa0"&gt;Red Candle Games’ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redcandlegames/status/1339148313032060929"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Devotion&lt;/em&gt; would finally find a home on GOG, however, has been short-lived. We’ve reached out to GOG for comment and will update accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord adds mobile screensharing, and it’s perfect for casual hangouts with your friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6B8OhxnIWCjME1fsi_yqpLRhrK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68523533/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mP8Faq"&gt;Today, Discord is rolling out screensharing to its mobile users. It’s a smart move; earlier this summer, the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21473602/among-us-downloads-discord-app-record"&gt;mobile app was hitting lifetime highs for downloads &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN2o6T"&gt;Mobile screensharing means that you can just share your screen — and whatever you’re watching — with anyone in a voice channel. That means you can watch everything from TikTok to Twitch with any of your friends from anywhere in the world, in real time. While chatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF3vkf"&gt;I saw a demo of the feature recently, and more than anything else, I found the simplicity astonishing. In our pandemic year, I’ve spent so much time socializing virtually — sometimes on Discord, sometimes not — and it’s underscored the importance of casual hangouts; spontaneity is one of the many things the pandemic has taken from everyday life.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFgGXU"&gt;Features like this one can return a little bit of that back to social interaction, I think, because it allows users to drop in and out whenever. I can screenshare to a Discord voice channel and any of my friends can just join me in whatever I feel like doing, be it &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; or just scrolling through my camera roll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DGRTh"&gt;Anything that makes it easier to be with people is good, in my book. But given how much time I’ve spent with people in various Discord servers this year, a feature like this one feels quietly revelatory. I miss hanging out on a friend’s couch and talking about nothing in particular; after this year, it’s something I’ll never take for granted again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUwz6z"&gt;This new feature is about as close as technology can get to replicating that feeling. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to slash buildings’ growing greenhouse gas emissions </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sunset from the Empire State Building in New York City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FUicyFkh28zG2OECLhPaUs5G5eA=/25x0:6127x4068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68523525/1291515807.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEMo7r"&gt;Carbon dioxide coming from the buildings where we live and work set a new record in 2019. What’s more, those planet-heating emissions will probably keep rising after the pandemic, the authors of a new &lt;a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/34572"&gt;UN report&lt;/a&gt; warn. The report urges governments to make structures more energy efficient and speed up a transition to renewable energy. Doing that could be a great way to address both the climate crisis and the economic downturn caused by COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztTzQE"&gt;The building sector was responsible for a whopping 38 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally in 2019, the report says. For comparison, all the planes, trains, automobiles, and other transportation in the world only pump out about 24 percent of global carbon emissions. Growing prosperity around the world, especially in developing nations that don’t yet have a lot of renewable energy, led to higher-than-normal rise in building sector emissions last year. When economies grow, there’s more construction, larger floor plans for buildings, and more energy-guzzling appliances and electronics filling those spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="U6tkOh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Air conditioning is one of the biggest worries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J47wX3"&gt;Air conditioning is one of the biggest worries when it comes to energy-hungry buildings. Economic development in hotter climates comes with a big bump in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16290934/india-air-conditioner-cooler-design-climate-change-cept-symphony"&gt;emissions from air conditioners&lt;/a&gt;. Historic heatwaves during 2019, the second hottest year on record, was another reason why that year saw the most building emissions on record, &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-buildings-2020"&gt;according to the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. “The need for more energy efficient air conditioning is so vital to the future of both emissions [and] the reality of what we’re building,” says Ian Hamilton, lead coordinating author of the new report. “Those lovely, great big glassy towers in hot parts of the world rely so heavily on air conditioning for them to be comfortable, livable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wK0miV"&gt;Economic prosperity doesn’t need to translate into more planet-heating pollution. About 10 percent of buildings’ environmental footprint comes from their construction and materials. But most of the emissions that buildings are responsible for come from the energy used for heating, cooling, and lighting. Right now, fossil fuels are still a large part of the energy mix — which is what report authors hope to see change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoHRCU"&gt;“There’s still lots and lots of work to be done there,” says Hamilton. “If electricity isn’t decarbonized, our emissions are going to carry on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NJAuwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Progress has actually slowed &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmeY7Q"&gt;Progress has actually slowed over the past several years, the report found. Buildings’ rate of improvement dropped in half between 2016 and 2019. “This gives us a failing direction grade,” Hamilton says. “The reality is that we had been making progress in 2015, 2016 towards that goal of the Paris [climate] Agreement. But in the last few years, that really tailed off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZT183Q"&gt;The Paris Agreement is a global commitment to stop the planet from heating more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The world is still on track to surpass that threshold, which scientists warn could transform our planet in devastating ways. To hit the Paris goal, every corner of our economy will need to reach net zero carbon pollution — releasing no more carbon dioxide than they draw down — by 2050. For that to become reality, building sector emissions need to keep falling by 6 percent every year until 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3HS59o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pandemic recovery dovetails with efforts to tackle climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP2Ocd"&gt;The pandemic slashed global emissions by about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575347/united-states-greenhouse-gas-emissions-historic-plummet"&gt;7 percent&lt;/a&gt; this year. But in the future, pollution cuts will need to be intentional. There’s been a push from some concerned leaders to ensure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243011/clean-energy-renewables-coronavirus-recession-stimulus-unemployment"&gt;pandemic recovery dovetails with efforts to tackle climate change&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, President-elect Joe Biden plans to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167938/governors-us-climate-change-alliance-clean-energy-jobs"&gt;10 million new jobs&lt;/a&gt; in clean energy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;another million jobs&lt;/a&gt; in constructing and upgrading sustainable homes and buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0IQbc"&gt;The new report also urges world leaders to include buildings in their plans to address climate change. Countries are expected to boost their plans for climate action by next year as part of the Paris Agreement. That’s really important for bringing more renewable energy to city grids and buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFYeag"&gt;At a local level, cities can update their building codes. New York City, for example, passed a series of bills in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/new-york-citys-newly-passed-green-new-deal-explained/"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/103-20/green-new-deal-mayor-de-blasio-new-energy-code-meet-challenge-global-warming"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; aimed at slashing carbon dioxide emissions from buildings that are responsible for 70 percent of the city’s greenhouse gases. That includes mandates to better insulate buildings and requirements for more efficient lighting, heating, and cooling systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omyS2B"&gt;“Keeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs. It will be an opportunity to help the broader state economy get back on track with what was already a fast growing sector,” Alicia Barton, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243011/clean-energy-renewables-coronavirus-recession-stimulus-unemployment"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. “Hopefully if we can think smartly about things the state can do and potentially see investments from the federal government, we have a good opportunity to seize a challenging moment and turn it into a moment of opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s latest update brings native support for Apple’s Arm-based Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzWZcPA_mhCFdLHBs09wyb2u5xE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68523482/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rrY0w1"&gt;Firefox’s latest update brings native support for Macs that run on Apple’s Arm-based silicon, Mozilla announced &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/84.0/releasenotes/"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. Mozilla claims that native Apple silicon support brings significant performance improvements: the browser apparently launches 2.5 times faster and web apps are twice as responsive than they were on the previous version of Firefox, which wasn’t native to Apple’s chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiJmQt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/upgrading-new-version-firefox-84-apple-silicon"&gt;Mozilla says&lt;/a&gt; that if you’re already running Firefox on your Mac and want to make sure that you’re running the native build, you’ll need to update to the newest version, Firefox 84, and then quit and restart Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFyBOZ"&gt;I’ve got a MacBook Air with Apple’s new M1 chip, so I installed the new Firefox update and gave it a whirl. It seems speedy enough, but I can’t conclusively confirm Mozilla’s claims about performance improvements in my few minutes of testing. (And to be fair, most things have been pretty speedy on this new Mac.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj7Svj"&gt;Firefox’s support of Apple’s Arm-based processors follows Chrome, which added support for Apple’s new chips shortly after the M1-equipped MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini were released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572418/google-chrome-run-natively-on-apples-arm-macs-m1"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl5ICA"&gt;Firefox 84 is also the last release to support Adobe Flash, which got its final scheduled update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166160/adobe-last-flash-player-update-support-ending-december"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="I38v2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s native version of Chrome for Apple’s Arm Macs is out now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572418/google-chrome-run-natively-on-apples-arm-macs-m1"},{"title":"Adobe just released the last Flash update ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166160/adobe-last-flash-player-update-support-ending-december"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 turns the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max into even better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZTf4Wwz-AsxzbgiJBpQXh7JPM8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511660/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0yKiG"&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max and consider yourself something of a photographer, the latest iOS update will help you get the most out of your phone’s cameras. That’s because it includes the new ProRAW feature that Apple first announced back at its October event. ProRAW combines the editing flexibility of RAW with Apple’s computational photography tricks like Smart HDR and Deep Fusion for the first time. You no longer have to choose between the flexibility of a standard RAW file and a JPEG or HEIC file that has all of Apple’s computational magic but limited potential for post-processing because ProRAW gives you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn29Fn"&gt;Shooting RAW photos on an iPhone is nothing new; for some time now, apps like Halide and Adobe Lightroom have let you capture all of the data the iPhone’s sensor can gather. And all of the usual benefits of RAW are here with ProRAW — vastly improved control over white balance is always the biggest factor for me — but it gives you greater leeway with adjusting exposure, sharpness, dynamic range, and more. You can make better adjustments to facial tone in a portrait or nail the exposure in a landscape shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHU4fB"&gt;But standard RAW images can look very grainy out of the iPhone since, well, these are still small smartphone camera sensors, and they’re without any computational photography optimization. Now, you should notice all the same detail as before but with less noise. That’s because ProRAW images do the same multiframe image processing as ordinary iPhone shots. Even with that, you get around 14 stops of dynamic range to work with in editing software. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnaQ11QShvs"&gt;This video from Josh Stunell on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of illustrating the differences between RAW and ProRAW:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3RPjZ"&gt;ProRAW can be used with all of the rear cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max — it’s not going to suddenly turn the ultrawide into a magic lens, but anything helps — and it also works in night mode. You can even access the people segmentation masks captured by the sensor to make portrait mode-style adjustments after the fact, provided your editing app allows you to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can shoot ProRAW images with all three of the cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1x51ON"&gt;How to use ProRAW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F4ih6B"&gt;To use ProRAW, first, you’ve got to enable it under the camera options in the settings menu. After that, you’ll see a “RAW” button appear at the upper-right of the camera viewfinder, which is how you can quickly toggle ProRAW on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLtObT"&gt;I should emphasize that while it’s easy to switch this on, you’re definitely not going to want to use ProRAW all the time. Files average around 25MB in size, which is dramatically larger than your everyday iPhone images. This is a feature best reserved for those very intentional photos with people you care about or at places that matter. ProRAW images appear in the camera roll like normal, but if you try to share them in apps like Instagram, you’ll get an error message. So you’ll want to export them as either a smaller JPEG or HEIC file first before sending them to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBt331"&gt;Another nice thing about ProRAW is since it uses Adobe’s widely supported DNG file format, there is already a plethora of apps that can open and edit the files without any update. But apps that use Apple’s own RAW converter will offer even more control since they’ll be able to access tone and distance mapping. Halide has already released an update to get the most out of ProRAW, and I’d expect others like Pixelmator, Darkroom, and Affinity Photo to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NP2Oib"&gt;Apps that have their own RAW converter, namely Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Capture One, can edit the DNG files today but won’t have all of the same capabilities as those that use Apple’s RAW converter. It’s possible Adobe and others will update their conversion tools in the future to make them work better with ProRAW. You can, of course, also just edit the images inside the Apple Photos app, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_l3ZTohF359m1aD2dhoBqv9yx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169707/IMG_0912_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample ProRAW image edited in Darkroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBvhVB"&gt;If you want to share a ProRAW image, there are various ways to go about it depending on what you’re trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wDL3C4"&gt;If you want to transfer an Apple ProRAW to the computer: ensure the photo is unedited, then either AirDrop or plug the device into USB and use Image Capture or the Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sQEb3m"&gt;If you want to share an edited ProRAW photo:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;edit the photo in the Photos app, then AirDrop, email, or send via Messages. A JPG with the edits will be shared. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VP6iXO"&gt;If you want to email a ProRAW DNG to someone: open the Photos app first and use the share button to share via Mail. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayEVZd"&gt;If you edit a ProRAW and want both the original DNG file and the edited JPG: use Image Capture or Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbkyu"&gt;If a ProRAW is edited but you want to transfer a DNG: duplicate the photo, then revert the edits (makes it an unedited file). A DNG can then be AirDropped, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ic83mC"&gt;If you used a third-party app that can take RAW+JPG, and you want both: use Image Capture to grab each file individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="U7m9E1"&gt;I’ve been trying out ProRAW on my iPhone 12 Pro Max over the last few days, and I’m already appreciating the difference it can make. It’s just plain easier to get the most from a photo — retrieve highlights, boost shadows, fix the white balance, etc. — if you’re willing to put in the work of editing after the fact.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3luVi7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated that ProRAW provides depth information for editing after the fact. This is incorrect, ProRAW provides segmentation masks for people detected in the frame, which can allow you to create portrait-style images after a photo is captured.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack launches an RSS reader to organize all your newsletter subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Substack Reader screenshot showing a list of newsletters on the left and individual posts on the right." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCQaUilaixkWl5oxIALJRFVehK8=/0x0:999x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68522975/Substack_Reader_copy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQ8zrq"&gt;If you’re worried about all your newsletter subscriptions getting lost in your inbox, Substack may have a solution. Today the platform is launching an RSS reader called &lt;a href="https://reader.substack.com/"&gt;Substack Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a streamlined collection of your latest newsletters. Any Substack newsletter you already subscribe to will automatically show up, and if you want, you can add third-party RSS feeds, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEOMWf"&gt;The goal was to “create a distraction free space” for people whose email inbox isn’t their ideal reading experience, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;Substack CEO Chris Best&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LPmLQz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It could be a way to discover new writers you want to subscribe to”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9lOIu"&gt;Substack Reader is launching as a beta, and it feels very much like a version one product. It presents a chronological list of every newsletter you’re subscribed to, and you can click on those entries to open them in a new window and read them. Right now, there’s no way to read stories inside of Substack Reader, like you can in a traditional RSS reader, and stories stay in your queue even after you’ve read them. (In-line reading is “something we are strongly considering for the future,” Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKExK8"&gt;The reader also separates out podcasts published through Substack, and it shows a lock icon next to subscriber-only newsletters, which could help to highlight just how much non-paying readers are missing out on. Anyone will be able to sign up for the beta starting today. At launch, it’s only available on the web. Mobile apps are “something we’ll look at,” Best said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="N6tDKp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can Substack CEO Chris Best build a new model for journalism?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8Xo6X"&gt;RSS readers have traditionally struggled to gain a large enough audience for companies to keep supporting them. Google infamously shut down Google Reader in 2013; Digg launched Digg Reader in response the same year, then shut it down five years later. Substack seems to be thinking about its reader as a companion to its newsletters, more than as a competitor to full-on RSS readers like Feedly. Still, Best said he hopes to expand the audience for a reader app by making it “as easy and simple as it can possibly be to get started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBHNSW"&gt;Longer term, the service may finally give Substack a space to start recommending different newsletters to existing users. “I think one of the reasons that we think an experience like this could be really good is it could be a way to discover new writers you want to subscribe to,” Best said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boh6lN"&gt;As Substack adds discovery features, Best said the service will stay away from putting “a bunch of clicky stuff in there that’s super tantalizing,” and stick to the platform’s existing goal of fostering a relationship between readers and writers they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dV1oK"&gt;Substack is adding some basic new &lt;a href="https://substack.com/discover"&gt;discovery features&lt;/a&gt; to its website today, too. The service’s existing list of top publications is being expanded to include a number of specific categories (beyond the previous “top paid” and “top free” lists), so you’ll be able to see the top political newsletters or top business newsletters and explore by your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IHlTLd"&gt;Google Stadia has finally made its way to iOS over a year after launch. The company’s mobile web beta for the iPhone and iPad, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;first announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, is launching today. That means any Stadia user on either its free tier or its paid Stadia Pro subscription will be able to access their library of Stadia games on Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsmvd1"&gt;Google, like other competing cloud services, is using mobile Safari due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming apps&lt;/a&gt; that mean platforms like Stadia can’t exist in their current form on the App Store. You can access Stadia through its website on Safari or by creating a home screen icon that will turn the service into a progressive web app, so it acts almost identically to a native one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qcI7H"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now&lt;/a&gt; or the planned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;mobile web version of Microsoft’s xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, however, Google Stadia has a free tier without restrictions and now offers two free-to-play games available (&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R&lt;/em&gt;), with more to come. That means anyone with a Gmail account looking to try Stadia can give it a shot on an iPhone or iPad with minimal effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J29xgg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Stadia now works on both Android and iOS, thanks to its new mobile web app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCnxaH"&gt;That accessibility could be key for Stadia’s growth going forward. Much of the early struggles of Stadia, and the many failed or otherwise unknown cloud platforms that have come before it, have to do with a mix of technical issues and economic hurdles, roadblocks that mean actually using the service as your primary gaming platform is more cumbersome and costly than the benefits. But Stadia is in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;much different place now than it was at launch&lt;/a&gt;. The service not only has a free tier and free-to-play games, but it also has access to high-profile holiday releases like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla &lt;/em&gt;and the just-released &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4UQFQ"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s new open-world sci-fi game has been plagued by bugs and performance issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;mainly affecting players on last-gen game consoles&lt;/a&gt;, which is a boon for the Stadia version. Google had to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/13/stadia-cyberpunk-premiere-edition-ended/"&gt;shut down a promotion for the game&lt;/a&gt; that awarded free Stadia controllers and Chromecast Ultra devices to anyone who preordered or purchased &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on Stadia up to a week after its release due to overwhelming demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oTHDB"&gt;Adding iOS support may add to the momentum Stadia is experiencing right now. I’ve had access to the beta on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Stadia test account for the last week or so where I’ve been testing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and other games on my iPad Pro and iPhone 11 Pro. It works remarkably well, even with the built-in touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6rRdN"&gt;I wouldn’t recommend relying on those touch controls for anything that requires precise input, but it was nice to know I could still maneuver the &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; interface using my iPhone touchscreen to perform simple tasks, like carousing the in-game Tower hub to pick up bounties or check my character’s inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIQB4B"&gt;Instead of touch, you’re better off using either a Stadia controller or one of the supported Bluetooth gamepads like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller or the Sony DualShock 4, and those controllers work seamlessly via mobile Safari with no issues I’ve encountered so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4KV7KW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ promotion ended early due to overwhelming demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahaUq"&gt;I will say that you have to rely on a Wi-Fi connection to reliable play on iOS unless you happen to be the owner of a rather rare and situational Ethernet to Lightning or USB adapter accessory. That means you’re not going to get super smooth visuals or performance all of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3JZf7"&gt;Still, a lot of the visual hiccups you might experience from using Stadia on an average Wi-Fi connection on a larger screen are not as noticeable when playing on the iPhone or iPad. In particular, I’ve found playing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on my iPad Pro to be a pretty consistent and solid experience, more so in some cases than on my PlayStation 5 where I find the game often crashes numerous times during a single play session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhm6ka"&gt;Due to Apple’s restrictions, Google says you will need to perform a tiny workaround to get the Stadia web version on your iOS device’s home screen as a progressive web app, and it’s created this graphic to explain it:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWtie2jMLEozrXhvuepl2VwNu2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22174622/Stadia_iOS_setup.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EYTrB3"&gt;The big caveat right now is that there are not a whole lot of great games on Stadia that cater to mobile players. I don’t see anyone going out of their way to boot up the new &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on an iPhone screen, except to marvel at the novelty of it. I think the iPad is primarily where Stadia on iOS will shine for the players who have a nice enough screen, a fast enough connection, and a controller to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03WshK"&gt;But iOS support opens up a lot of avenues for Stadia — not just to bring it more players looking for a more robust mobile gaming solution but also to promote cloud gaming to developers making the kinds of games fit for mobile screens. If Google cozies up to more indie developers and starts supporting more of the less graphical-intensive experiences you might see on, say, a Nintendo Switch, that could make Stadia a much more competitive platform. &lt;/p&gt;
