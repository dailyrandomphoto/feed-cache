    <title>OnePlus is spoiling its 9 and 9 Pro keynote with early reveals and here’s the TL;DR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OV53Mvzvvg87ojtCoEn9BsAjJIU=/112x0:1843x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986485/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.38.59_AM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3I8qce"&gt;OnePlus will be formally announcing the 9 and 9 Pro phones, a smartwatch, and a blazing fast wireless charger on March 23rd — but why wait? OnePlus definitely isn’t: it’s been spoiling its own announcements non-stop on Twitter, YouTube, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22335032/oneplus-9-pro-fast-wireless-charging"&gt;right here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One day the CEO will &lt;em&gt;tweet out&lt;/em&gt; which processor the phone will use; the next, the company will just upload &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371427524027113473?s=20"&gt;pictures of the phone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371430983409541120?s=20"&gt;multiple angles&lt;/a&gt;! If you haven’t been keeping up, we’ve compiled all the... leaks? mini-announcements? in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VbxpkT"&gt;Confirmed by OnePlus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmyBTC"&gt;OnePlus has been in the habit lately of trying to build up suspense for its events, which is why you see it and its executives just tweeting out information about the phones. Here’s what we’ve learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UOKA5i"&gt;There will be at least two phones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DDC87U"&gt;The OnePlus 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JiJSsB"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro, which will have a bigger camera and probably a bigger, better display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lhQqWR"&gt;There’s also a third, less expensive phone coming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4FWbbQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;There were rumors &lt;/a&gt;of a cheaper third phone, which OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338504/oneplus-9r-less-expensive-phone-confirmed-india-5g"&gt;has now confirmed will be called the 9R&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, the company has only confirmed that the phone will be sold in India, and that it will feature 5G. It’s also unclear if it will be announced at the March 23rd event, or if it will be coming later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8N3qvy"&gt;Chargers? In the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kgVwo9"&gt;OnePlus’s CEO, Pete Lau, has confirmed on a forum post that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319657/oneplus-9-charger-in-box-pete-lau-announcement"&gt;will be including a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt; with the 9-series phones, instead of going the route that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225930/samsung-galaxy-s21-no-charger-brick-headphones-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BKDz3r"&gt;The Pro will have 50W wireless charging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6LSMRg"&gt;OnePlus has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22099073"&gt;let &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;try the 9 Pro’s 50W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, and it is indeed fast, charging the phone from 1 to 100% in 43 minutes. If you prefer charging with a cable, both the Pro and regular 9 will support 65W wired charging as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3IqcIH"&gt;OnePlus has already shown off the design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3qPDX1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;Input has a collection&lt;/a&gt; of all the images that OnePlus has posted of the 9 Pro on Twitter, and there’s not a ton left to the imagination. It does, in fact, look like a smartphone, with USB-C port on the bottom, and a camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_J0Z-X41ti1g5WJVCjBt0YCtB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377986/1_M00_22_12_rB8bwmBQEOWACzO_AAZ7LBXLBP0204.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasselblad branding and a variety of lenses. The 9 is on the left, the 9 Pro on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Zo1q43"&gt;OnePlus is focusing on cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9nfFNG"&gt;We know that the legendary camera company Hasselblad will be working on &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;providing “color expertise” for the phones’ cameras&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus has been dropping subtle hints about the collaboration, like centering its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306934/oneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau"&gt;marketing material around the moon&lt;/a&gt; (when Apollo astronauts went to the moon, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise"&gt;they took Hasselblad cameras&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oneplus-says-screw-it-heres-the-oneplus-9-pro-photos-from-every-angle"&gt;releasing pictures of the phones&lt;/a&gt;, which have the word “Hasselblad” written on the camera modules. And having a Hasselblad section on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Flaunch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F18%2F22334396%2Foneplus-9-march-23rd-event-rumor-announcement-roundup-smartwatch-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the phone’s launch page&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, maybe it’s not so subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t2j5X"&gt;When it comes to the capabilities of those cameras, we can look at an &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-9-exclusive-ceo-pete-lau-on-its-new-camera-and-whats-next"&gt;interview Pete Lau did with &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the phones working with Sony to make a custom IMX789 sensor (something he’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;also tweeted about&lt;/a&gt;), and mentions that they will be capable of shooting 4K at 120FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsIHrY"&gt;What the camera capabilities of the 9 Pro versus the regular 9 are will probably have to wait for the official announcement — but the pictures released by OnePlus show that the Pro seems to have four cameras, where the regular only has three. As with past OnePlus phones, at least one of the cameras &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1369304680241762311"&gt;will be an ultra-wide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T3LZsr"&gt;Of course, the phones will be 5G-capable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YLd2pZ"&gt;The OnePlus 8 series had 5G, and the 9 series will too, as indicated by the “5G” superscript on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;OnePlus’s announcement images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K0JSrg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's an EXCLUSIVE look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlusWatch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlusWatch&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlus9Series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlus9Series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@oneplus&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href="https://t.co/tKBUcXkuth"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tKBUcXkuth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Unbox Therapy (@UnboxTherapy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnboxTherapy/status/1372881459892084736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2vdq5B"&gt;There will be a smartwatch launched as well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xYowLD"&gt;OnePlus has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339768/oneplus-watch-image-reveal-design-leak-smartwatch-wearable"&gt;revealed an image of the device&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/17/oneplus-watch-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;confirmed that it won’t be running Google’s Wear OS&lt;/a&gt;. It also seems that all the specs for the watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1372072726500843522?s=20"&gt;have been leaked&lt;/a&gt;, though those aren’t officially confirmed by OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vXVuXF"&gt;The phones will use the Snapdragon 888&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJYho"&gt;OnePlus is continuing its tradition of including Qualcomm’s flagship-class processor, according to tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1372193579674841090?s=20"&gt;from Pete Lau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1372140664868208643?s=20"&gt;the OnePlus account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hXzd1h"&gt;What we know about the displays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FqInCT"&gt;Pete Lau also tweeted out most of the details about the 9 Pro’s display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jQovJ1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just the rundown: &lt;br&gt;LTPO&lt;br&gt;QHD+ &lt;br&gt;Smart 120Hz &lt;br&gt;Native 10-bit color depth (1.07 billion colors)&lt;br&gt;1300 nits&lt;br&gt;MEMC&lt;br&gt;HDR10+&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371817947694514176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aam7r6"&gt;LTPO displays &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;can run at different refresh rates&lt;/a&gt; depending on the content being displayed, meaning that the OnePlus 9 screens should be able to sip power when displaying static images, but still provide smooth animations &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1371830276926668801?s=20"&gt;at 120Hz when you’re actually using the phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; has already seen &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;in-depth testing results&lt;/a&gt; from the Pro’s screen, showing its power usage, and 360Hz touch-polling rate, which should lead to improved responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ix5v"&gt;Also new to the Pro is a 10-bit display which should, in theory, show colors more accurately. Otherwise, it’s packing many of the same features as the screen on the OnePlus 8 Pro, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"&gt;is not a complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, unless you don’t like big screens — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/exclusive-first-test-results-of-the-radical-oneplus-9-pro-display"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro’s display is 6.7 inches, the same size as an iPhone Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nWX31N"&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="almzN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1371400783950970881"&gt;We’ve officially seen&lt;/a&gt; the Pro’s Morning Mist (silver) and regular OnePlus 9’s Winter Mist (purple) colors, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="456Leu"&gt;Left to the Imagination (and leaks)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u71pvB"&gt;... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;there have also been leaks showing off other colors&lt;/a&gt;, like a forest green on the Pro, and a blue for the regular OnePlus 9. And, of course, there are black versions of each phone as well (I anxiously await to see if OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;makes a big deal about it in the presentation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IB9KKz"&gt;The Regular 9 will have a (slightly) smaller screen than the Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QE1Lvf"&gt;While OnePlus officially shared the Pro’s screen size with &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the details of the regular 9 weren’t mentioned. &lt;a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-9-key-specs-leaked-through-aida64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slashleaks &lt;/em&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be 6.55 inches, and have a slightly lower resolution of 1080 x 2400, as opposed to the 1440 x 3216 reported for the Pro by &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bD7qLf"&gt;
&lt;p id="IkhucV"&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau"&gt;its CEO&lt;/a&gt; are going to be posting more details on Twitter during the lead-up to the event, but at this point it seems like we’ve got a good outline of what the phones will be like. Now, it’s just waiting until the 23rd, at 10AM ET, to have the details filled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WucYt2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 19th, 3:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moved the budget OnePlus 9R from the rumored section to the known section, as it has been confirmed by OnePlus. Also added the smartwatch reveal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astell &amp; Kern’s new USB-C DAC promises hi-fi audio for phones without headphone jacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJgX7flNLlL1FQlTD7Cwzv0OiXo=/0x11:1024x694/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68995053/dac.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uDpLxR"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern — the company best known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304140/astell-kerns-1799-music-player-lets-you-switch-between-dacs"&gt;high-end portable digital audio players&lt;/a&gt; — is making a &lt;a href="https://us.astellnkern.com/products/ak-usb-c-dual-dac-cable-pee51"&gt;USB-C DAC&lt;/a&gt; (digital-to-analog converter) that’s designed to help get better-sounding audio from modern smartphones and computers that may lack a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5Vm32"&gt;If you want to use any digital device with a 3.5mm headphone jack, you need a DAC. Older devices that had 3.5mm headphone jacks featured integrated DACs (some better than others, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/12/12450100/lg-v20-specs-quad-dac-smartphone-audio"&gt;LG’s famous Quad DAC&lt;/a&gt; system on its former flagships).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="wcf2ef"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:705815"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNBoeN"&gt;But the death of the 3.5mm headphone jack on modern smartphones in favor of exclusively USB-C (or in Apple’s case, Lightning ports) has left a gap for audiophiles. Now if you want to use older headphones or sound setups, you’ll need a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack dongle — which, by default, is already technically a DAC. (In fact, some, like Apple’s $9 USB-C dongle, &lt;a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/review-apple-vs-google-usb-c-headphone-adapters.5541/"&gt;are apparently fairly decent&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7rIZ1"&gt;But the new Astell &amp;amp; Kern USB-C Dual DAC promises a higher-fidelity experience, offering two CS43198 DACs paired with an analog amplifier to offer a better sound experience, with support for 32bit/384kHz playback. And given the $150 price tag, it had better offer a better experience than Apple or Google’s sub-$10 dongles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thfuJp"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern says it’s drawing on its experience of creating portable media players to build the new USB-C DAC, and while the DAC itself doesn’t have an external power supply (instead drawing power from the phone or computer), the company says it can still drive a pair of “high impedance headphones with a 2Vrms (Condition No Load) output level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ISrUz"&gt;The new DAC should be compatible with “most” Android smartphones and tablets and both macOS and Windows 10 computers. But Astell &amp;amp; Kern says that iOS devices — even USB-C ones like Apple’s recent iPad Pro lineup — won’t be compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S28KVy"&gt;The new Astell &amp;amp; Kern USB-C Dual DAC is &lt;a href="https://us.astellnkern.com/products/ak-usb-c-dual-dac-cable-pee51"&gt;available to preorder now&lt;/a&gt; from the company’s website ahead of a planned May release date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger seem to be recovering from a major outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ppGbX_-aDd_0l9JqdRHAw0kMYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994607/akrales_180614_1777_0229.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x05WR"&gt;Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and other Facebook services were down for many for about an hour on Friday, but they seem to be recovering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGv2MV"&gt;At one point, more than 119,000 users reported issues with Instagram &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/"&gt;on DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;. More than 25,000 users reported issues with &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/whatsapp/"&gt;WhatsApp on DownDetector, too&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook Messenger was affected as well, with &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook-messenger/"&gt;more than 5,000 reports of problems on DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ONKRk"&gt;When navigating to Instagram’s website during the outage, I saw a white page with the message “5xx Server Error.” While the service was experiencing issues, I also redownloaded Instagram to my phone and tried to log in but hit an error there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZ8YoUgbcGJ438PaefAwYg4jqD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383062/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.27.53_AM.png"&gt;

&lt;p id="uHeE7u"&gt;Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. The Facebook Gaming Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FacebookGaming/status/1372969710514364418"&gt;acknowledged that&lt;/a&gt; “there are a number of issues currently affecting Facebook products, including gaming streams.” The account said multiple teams are working on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fontemon is a playable Minnesota-themed Pokémon parody somehow crammed into a font</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_k5oKfFP9THrpSos_COw0D7SvZg=/107x0:634x351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994822/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_9.54.47_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Michael Mulet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fuXBC8"&gt;Fontemon is technically a font, but it’s also, somewhat miraculously, a playable miniature &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; parody, spotted by software engineer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/d_feldman/status/1372778427955044356?s=20"&gt;Daniel Feldman&lt;/a&gt;. The game, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mmulet"&gt;made by Michael Mulet&lt;/a&gt;, stretches my understanding of what a font &lt;em&gt;is,&lt;/em&gt; but it’s certainly amazing. Also, it’s filled with Minnesota references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjH6cm"&gt;The experience is not as “smooth” as a modern &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game or even the original Game Boy entries, but it is sort of reminiscent of typing on a typewriter, with user interface elements and half-font / half-monsters plopping down on the screen as if they were slammed there by a type bar. The Minnesota elements might feel out of place, but they’re pretty funny overall. You’ll battle your way through Ottowa, Lakeville, and a pair of “Twin Cities” and be treated to instances of Minnesota Nice and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3YYJvIxAq0"&gt;hotdish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24-Wm00q89md_a_RUaYfd4VM840=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382928/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_9.49.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Michael Mulet&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The entire structure of Fontemon, which somehow fits in a downloadable font.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="flzvAc"&gt;Playing Fontemon is as simple as typing — whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html#player"&gt;in the game’s webpage&lt;/a&gt; or in your own word processor or image editor with &lt;a href="https://github.com/mmulet/font-game-engine/releases/"&gt;a downloadable version of the font&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest way to progress through the story is by not trying to type coherently, though. The game will putter along through the usual &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; milestones of receiving a starter monster and heading out to your first gym battles with a string of nonsense characters. Just make sure to type the correct letters once you’re in a battle. Of course, if you mess up or lose, you can also just hit backspace to undo your mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X32FUj"&gt;Now, I admittedly get lost in the specific technical details of how all of this works, but Mulet has provided a thorough explanation of how it came together &lt;a href="https://github.com/mmulet/code-relay/blob/main/markdown/HowIDidIt.md"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. As I understand it, Fontemon is built in &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/overview"&gt;OpenType&lt;/a&gt;, a flexible font format created by Microsoft that can be used and modified for a bunch of different digital settings. Mulet used a method similar to how PDFs produce text and images to create the visuals in Fontemon, and he assigned game logic and character sprites to ligatures (combined font characters that are “printed” as singled glyphs like “æ”) to build out the game and its 43 distinct choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J1XUD"&gt;It’s a wild creation and a fun diversion for anyone looking to squeeze in an extra hit of pocket monsters. You can try Fontemon for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html#player"&gt;on Mulet’s site, Code Relay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.2 patch promises to tone down omniscient teleporting cops and pinball driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLlVc2nqHMYdfNPOme0yd9JJRt8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994646/cyberpunk_2077_screenshot_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FZSaB"&gt;CD Projekt Red (CDPR) has detailed the improvements it plans to bring to &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; in its upcoming 1.2 patch. &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37768/whats-new-in-night-city-patch-1-2-development-insight"&gt;The announcement&lt;/a&gt;, written as an in-universe newscast, details the planned quality-of-life improvements, including police not instantly appearing when you commit a crime, an improved driving experience, and a setting that should prevent you from accidentally dodging into traffic or off a building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQ1P6m"&gt;While the game has received a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of criticism for being generally buggy — and, in some respects, unfinished — it does seem like CDPR is trying to address some of the most memed-on complaints. In the section of the blog post about the improved police response, there’s a jokey in-universe anecdote that captures an experience many players will have had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SFv3fT"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;My choom, Jake, was in a shoot-out with Tyger Claws the other day, when he missed a shot and hit a pedestrian on the other side of the street. In an instant, the NCPD swarmed up on him and put him down. It’s like they appeared out of thin air right behind his back! It’s too brutal of a response for a regular accidental murder if you ask me!&lt;/em&gt;” — Mike from Kabuki, 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lYvniZ"&gt;The driving experience in the game is also, uh, not very good. CDPR is hoping to make it better by improving the steering response (you can see a comparison video below) and making it so your car can automatically get unstuck if it finds itself resting on a barrier or other object. While the improved steering should help, there’s also plenty of other issues with driving (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;such as collision detection&lt;/a&gt;) that will have to be addressed before driving becomes, you know, fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xoL9SY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IJHhQmmwyc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bkWz8N"&gt;The patch was initially supposed to come out in February but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299184/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-delayed-cd-projekt-red-studio-hack"&gt;was delayed&lt;/a&gt; when the studio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274035/cd-projekt-hack-source-code-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-encrypt-data-ransom"&gt;fell victim to a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;. CDPR is now aiming to release it in “&lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/patch-1-2-development-update.11081719/"&gt;the second half of March.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9Mpci"&gt;It’s now been &lt;a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2021/03/cdprs_blockbuster_rpg_cyberpunk_2077_now_nearing_three_months_missing_from_ps_store"&gt;around three months&lt;/a&gt; since the game was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; due to the immense number of bugs (and the fact that it was nearly unplayable on a base PlayStation 4). So far, Sony and CDPR haven't responded to requests for comment on when the game will return to the platform, so it’s unclear if this patch will be enough to return the game to the platform’s online shop.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Series X is available at Best Buy [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nY2j_p_nE6Ao5sivv5G3AtMVzAo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994430/vpavic_201103_4275_0196.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VDZvv5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 19th, 2021 2:23PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of Xbox Series X consoles for today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBFaZ6"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735358059910495495#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; consoles launched a few months ago, but if you have been keeping up with the news, you know that these consoles are some of the hardest products to buy right now. Those looking for another shot at the $500 Series X can try their luck right now at Best Buy. You will have the option to pay for either console in full or through Xbox All Access, which would allow you to get the console with no upfront cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoCh5e"&gt;Due to the high demand, the retailer is releasing small waves of inventory for the console every few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="v2iBsS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10384596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwoxv5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLuT14"&gt;Once you’ve secured your next-gen Xbox, you might want to buy some additional items, such as games to play on your new console. Several of the most popular games to play on these consoles include third-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21332881/xbox-studios-games-series-x-optimized-forza-gears"&gt;popular Xbox One titles&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fforza-horizon-4%2F9pnqkhfld2wq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;received graphical updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sah8hS"&gt;Of course, if you are unsure what games to buy, you could always subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of first- and third-party titles from various developers and publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xmQCoE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="PbVSAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce6rHG"&gt;A must-have accessory I think is worth buying is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt; if you plan to play couch co-op games with family or friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2zGBUP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="eglaXe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="FtJmt6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ooSyA4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gotham Knights is delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioRfI1MVO1xJsLEyy4ZYJzUUlvM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994346/screenshot_02.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eF7WXa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming title by Warner Bros. Games Montreal, has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GothamKnights/status/1372940963270643712?s=20"&gt;delayed into 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced today. In a statement posted on Twitter, the development team explains that it wants to give the game “more time to deliver the best possible experience for players.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HI7l6"&gt;While not directly stated, the delay is likely COVID-related, as studios continue to adapt to working from home. This is the second highly anticipated title from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment getting pushed back into next year, following the announcement in January that Avalanche Software’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229085/hogwarts-legacy-delay-2022-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt; will not hit its 2021 release window&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6j7kAT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In a self-isolated world, developers are learning to make games from home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222465/coronavirus-game-developers-work-from-home-bungie-riot"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="W43OES"&gt;Announced during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376323/gotham-knights-fandome-warner-bros-montreal-batman-game"&gt;DC FanDome event&lt;/a&gt; in late August, &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397224/gotham-knights-gameplay-footage-warnerbros-games-montreal-fandome-robin-batgirl"&gt;open-world action RPG&lt;/a&gt; featuring Batman and some supporting cast such as Batgirl and Robin. While no firm release date has yet been announced, &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt; will release on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, and Xbox One. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ChilledCow puts channel name out to pasture with a rebrand to ‘Lofi Girl’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-MnZYJEXEbJLeF0IHbtTTpzti4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994340/40c40c35_3727_4939_b82b_2f1061b12197.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sTl5Zv"&gt;The hugely popular lo-fi music YouTube channel ChilledCow isn’t just known for its chill, cozy beats; the iconic animations of the girl sitting and working at her desk are instantly recognizable around the internet. (She’s even being turned into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/11/22325348/youtooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine"&gt;one-foot-tall figurine&lt;/a&gt;.) And on Thursday, the channel’s sixth anniversary, ChilledCow fully embraced the icon by rebranding the channel to “Lofi Girl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE44WU"&gt;“This was a very tough decision to make, but the driving force behind it is the fact that ChilledCow’s name was chosen many years ago, and is no longer reflective of what the channel is about anymore,” Lofi Girl said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl/status/1372643625167958023/photo/1"&gt;in a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EfKgsW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/hwfmZ9jACT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hwfmZ9jACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lofi Girl (@lofigirl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl/status/1372643625167958023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ipX5pJ"&gt;The YouTube channel is indeed called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; now, and the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lofigirl"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; accounts are @lofigirl. (The Instagram account is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chilledcow_yt/"&gt;still @chilledcow_yt&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe that will change soon.) Otherwise, the channel remains the same — there is still a live stream of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;soft electronic beats to work or relax to&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWcJFNfaw9c"&gt;second, mellower stream&lt;/a&gt;, if that’s what you’re in the mood for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT0mLJ"&gt;“Don’t worry, this change won’t affect in any way the content on the channel but will instead pave the way for many exciting projects for you all in the future!” Lofi Girl said. “The channel has been and always will be about music, art and positivity only.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaio Z (2021) review: carbon tax</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A lightweight laptop with a sky-high price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="R7XYXG"&gt;The Vaio Z is, speaking pragmatically, a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBAa27"&gt;There are two things about it that are groundbreaking — at least on paper. The first is that it’s made entirely of carbon fiber. While plenty of high-end laptops, including the Dell XPS 13, have sheets of carbon fiber across their palm rests and other materials on the sides, the Vaio Z includes &lt;em&gt;contoured&lt;/em&gt; carbon fiber, meaning the material is molded around the edges, and the whole thing is carbon fiber. (Vaio says the Z is the first laptop to use contoured carbon fiber, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/31/3054260/gigabyte-x11-carbon-fiber-laptop-lightest-announcement"&gt;2012 Gigabyte X11&lt;/a&gt; also claims an all-carbon fiber build.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIfy17"&gt;The second is, at 2.11 pounds, the Vaio Z is the lightest laptop to include an Intel H-Series chip. (That refers to the lightest-possible configuration. I was sent a slightly heavier one at 2.32 pounds.) H-Series processors are high-performance chips most commonly found in gaming laptops and workstations. It’s highly unusual to see one in a thin and light laptop, especially one that’s just over two pounds; machines of this size generally include the lower-powered U-Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU0cMb"&gt;This model includes the quad-core Core i7-11375H, the current flagship of Intel’s brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;“Tiger Lake H” series&lt;/a&gt;. When announcing the chip at CES, Intel claimed it would offer the fastest single-thread performance on the market, with boost clock speeds up to 5GHz. That’s an impressive prospect, especially in a 2.3-pound chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV03PE"&gt;But the third thing to understand about the Vaio Z is that it’s not cheap. The base model is — I’m not kidding — $3,579 for a Core i7-11375H, a 14-inch 4K screen, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. You can go all the way up to a $4,179 system with 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. I was sent a model in the middle, with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="79cNfS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10370468"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbMz6W"&gt;A laptop of that price isn’t a realistic purchase for most people, even if it’s spectacular. So instead, I’m going to use this review to explore two questions that concern the future of the luxury laptop market — questions the Vaio Z is setting out to answer: one, is contoured carbon fiber the future? And two, can a 2.32-pound laptop with an H-Series processor work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vS4s5A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vaio claims that the Vaio Z is sturdier and feels nicer than other laptops&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KFLbhK"&gt;Unfortunately, as of this writing, the answer to both of those questions is “not yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHgHTm"&gt;We’ll start with the build. Vaio’s elevator pitch is that the contoured carbon fiber is both stronger than other common materials (like magnesium alloy and aluminum alloy) that other premium laptops are made of, and ideal for combining rigidity with a light build. Carbon fiber also allows manufacturers to tailor stiffness and flexibility to specific regions of the laptop (using the number of layers and direction of lamination). Vaio claims, consequently, the Vaio Z is sturdier and feels nicer than other laptops close to its weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z from the left side, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2wc3Oml1UXhM5w8m5cu6-tbQ2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341486/mchin_210225_4449_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carbon fiber laminate on all four sides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R86ymx"&gt;Sturdiness and rigidity are difficult claims to verify with a review unit for obvious reasons. Vaio says the Z has passed MIL-STD 10H torture tests, including drop tests, pressure tests, and body-twist tests among others. There aren’t a ton of 2.3-pound laptops out there, and I don’t doubt that the Vaio Z may be objectively better-built than the rest of that class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BV1KZm"&gt;But does it feel &lt;em&gt;sturdy&lt;/em&gt;? Not really. There’s a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; amount of flex in the keyboard and screen. While I usually have to push pretty hard to get keyboards to bend, the area under the Shift key trampolined with a firm thumb press. The display is so bendy that I was careful when torquing it because I was legitimately afraid of snapping it in half. I know most people aren’t actively trying to bend their laptops, but I would be afraid that putting too much weight on this unit could damage the screen and keyboard over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuiQOg"&gt;When I initially asked Vaio about this, the company told me that the product is still in the preorder stage, and chassis quality would improve closer to its shipping date. The company later sent me a mass-production model. That the keyboard deck turned out to be a bit sturdier, particularly the area under the shift key. That said, the considerable flex in the screen remains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2MLhAKqCb8gZndUzoE6zJ7XyMxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341482/mchin_190527_4449_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key tops are concave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AM0FLT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lid and bottom have a plasticky texture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsgICJ"&gt;The carbon fiber’s texture is certainly unique. I like the feel of the palm rests, sides, and bottom. But the lid has plasticky texture. I wouldn’t guess that the Z was a $3,500 laptop just from holding it, especially right after holding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. The other thing to note is that the whole chassis is a fingerprint magnet — the lid, the sides, the palm rests, the keyboard. I could wipe the prints off easily, but they were always back in abundance after a few hours of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDnKCo"&gt;The carbon fiber does contribute to one significant benefit, though: the Vaio Z is unbelievably light. It’s so light that picking it up messes with your mind; it’s hard to believe there’s anything inside. This would certainly be the best laptop to buy if you’re looking for the lightest of the light. But if you’re looking for a sturdy, rigid form factor, I’m dubious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z lid seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cj1M2lF4F-3Q9qlDnJ01saU4cWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341480/mchin_190527_4449_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaio has been using multilayer carbon fiber in laptops since 2003. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DwMnas"&gt;On to the second question: has Vaio managed to put H-Series power in a U-Series form factor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKtBI3"&gt;In a literal sense, yes. The laptop works. And the one thing I do appreciate is the battery life. I averaged six hours and 57 minutes of continuous office multitasking with the display at 200 nits of brightness and Battery Saver on. That’s less juice than I get from the M1 MacBook Pro, but it’s fine as Intel H-Series processors go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CHsyMC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10370480"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOgYq8"&gt;But in terms of raw power, results are mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJo4x6"&gt;I ran several benchmarks to see how this brand-new chip stacks up against some of the more powerful thin systems out there — particularly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s M1-based MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;, which is powered by one of Intel’s top Tiger Lake U-Series chips. Note that while both of these models are heavier than the Vaio Z, they’re also less than half its price. So I was hoping it would solidly outperform them under the heavy loads that you’d want an H-Series processor for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1p4y54"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10370542"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8M5hqj"&gt;The Z beat the Razer Book in our Adobe Premiere Pro export test by a bit less than a minute — a victory, to be sure, but not a margin to write home about. More disappointingly, it lost to the MacBook Pro by a similar margin on that test. Apple’s laptop also came out ahead in every other test I ran apart from Cinebench’s single-core benchmark. (That’s expected; single-core performance is what Intel claims is so great about this chip.) That’s not a great argument for spending multiple thousands more on the Vaio Z, even with its impressive chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtIeDE"&gt;One issue seems to be that the Vaio Z’s 65W charger is insufficient for the types of loads most users would want an H-Series processor for. During several Adobe Premiere Pro exports and several runs of Cinebench multicore, the laptop’s battery drained even though it was plugged in. (Nothing else was running during these tests.) This could be a problem if you’re hoping to run intense loads for long periods of time, especially if you’re not always starting at a full charge. More importantly, it means power delivery may have been limiting the Vaio Z’s performance on these tasks. (Vaio tells me this is by design; it wanted to keep the charger small and portable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z on a table with three potted plants in the background, open and angled to the left. The screen displays a red flower on a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IEKTcfBDI60216ossUTofd9B8VU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341484/mchin_190527_4449_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fold-under hinge is supposed to provide a more ergonomic typing experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwVjqx"&gt;To Vaio’s credit, the Z has impressive cooling for such a small machine. Neither the chassis nor the CPU ever reached a worrisome temperature. But the dual fans were mega-loud during heavy loads, and sometimes under lighter ones as well. My mom could hear the unit from the next room over while it was running a Premiere export. She told me later that she “thought it was going to take off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAo3mN"&gt;For the benefit of folks with deep pockets who are considering buying this laptop, I’ll run through the rest of the specs. The highlight is the backlit keyboard, which provides 1.5mm of travel. It’s excellent — comfortable, smooth, and not at all loud. You also get a webcam with a convenient physical privacy shutter, which supports Windows Hello. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio logo below the bottom left corner of the Vaio Z keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lYFy0LsSwzAOpaqMDY_zMwi5CYk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341481/mchin_190527_4449_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaio says it “aimed for a comfortable keystroke that feels as if it is absorbed by your fingertips.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z open, seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCeEWccGJtdc2zhZuP2AiO11YGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341485/mchin_210225_4449_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charger delivers up to 65W and weighs 0.36 pounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="asxvkg"&gt;Audio is standard laptop fare: it gets impressively loud without audible distortion, but percussion and bass are almost nonexistent. You can swap to “Movie Mode” and “Gaming Mode” in the Dolby Audio software that comes preloaded on the Vaio Z, and I preferred listening to my music on these profiles. They strengthen the background music beneath the vocals and give everything a stronger surround quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aMINTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I wish there was a USB-A&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="guENJx"&gt;Connectivity includes two USB Type-C ports (supporting Thunderbolt 4, power delivery, and DisplayPort 1.4), a headphone jack, a security lock slot, and an HDMI. I know the Vaio’s space is limited, but I wish there was a USB-A port in there. You also get a nice 3840 x 2160 non-touch display and a roomy touchpad (though it has physical clickers on the bottom, which I always find to be a huge pain). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6chViE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vaio SX14 review: Lots of ports mean business","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18295153/vaio-sx14-review-lots-of-ports-mean-business"},{"title":"The Vaio SX12 offers too little for too much","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21153098/vaio-sx12-review-display-design-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9WwMeh"&gt;I have two strong opinions about the Vaio Z: one, it’s an impressive feat of engineering, and two, it’s still too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0tsAX"&gt;Vaio’s achievements with contoured carbon fiber are commendable. It’s unusual to see, whether Vaio is the first to do it. And the fact that there’s a 2.32-pound laptop on shelves at all, let alone one housing an H-Series processor, makes me optimistic about the future of the market. It’s been a very cool device to use, one I’m grateful to have experienced first-hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQrsKl"&gt;But the performance bump the Core i7-11375H delivers in this form factor isn’t enough of an improvement to justify a multithousand-dollar premium over all kinds of more affordable models on the market today, whether they contain M1 chips, AMD chips, or chips from Intel itself. Neither is the contoured carbon fiber — which, while cool, won’t bring a concrete benefit to most customers. At half its price, the Vaio Z would be in the conversation; at $3,579, I’m happy to commend it from afar. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer TravelMate P6 review: a suitable business partner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A consumer laptop in business clothing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="It86Su"&gt;Any business laptop that comes out these days is entering a tough field full of very established players. The world is already stuffed full of ThinkPads and Latitudes, which have strong followings, cover price ranges across the board, and are highly attuned to what workers need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbKS6Y"&gt;So my question with lesser-known business laptops is usually: Where does this fit? What customer is it catering to who might be underserved by a ThinkPad? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHpfdN"&gt;With its TravelMate line (specifically the TravelMate P6), Acer seems to be going for two potential openings. The first is that the TravelMate is, as the name implies, specifically intended for frequent business travelers. It’s light, portable, and sturdy, at the expense of some other traits. And the second is its price. Starting at $1,199.99, the TravelMate line is targeting a more price-conscious demographic than many business laptops that would be considered “premium” are. I think the TravelMate succeeds in filling these two niches in particular. But it has some other drawbacks that make it tough to recommend for a general audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nKVDZa"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer says the TravelMate is for “modern, mobile, security-conscious customers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 keyboard and touchpad seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnfebFq53Vu9lzePOb5tMk1-tfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310322/akrales_210212_4404_0147.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, all business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ncirZ2"&gt;The aspect of the TravelMate that should be a big help to mobile business users is the port selection. Despite being quite thin, the laptop is able to fit a USB Type-C (supporting USB 3.1 Gen 2, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3, and USB charging), two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 (one with power-off USB charging), one HDMI 2.0, one microSD reader, one combination audio jack, one Ethernet port (with a trap-door hinge), one DC-In jack for Acer’s adapter, one lock slot, and an optional SmartCard reader. The fewer dongles and docks you have to travel with, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VnPEX"&gt;Portability is another priority here and is another one of the TravelMate’s highlight features. At just 2.57 pounds and 0.65 inches thick, the TravelMate should be a breeze to carry around in a backpack or briefcase. Acer says it’s put the product through a slew of durability tests for weight and pressure, drops, shocks, vibrations, and other hiccups you may encounter during the day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRuqSo"&gt;Another area that’s likely important to some mobile professionals is videoconferencing capability. I found that to be a mixed bag here. The TravelMate’s four-microphone array had no trouble catching my voice, in both voice recognition and Zoom meeting use cases. Acer says they can pick up voices from up to 6.5 feet away. The webcam also produces a fine picture (though this unit doesn’t support Windows Hello for easy logins) and has a physical privacy shutter. The speakers are not great, though — music was tinny with thin percussion and nonexistent bass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate half closed angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aq4pqC9B0nRQrWijJk2zGTWjb_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310324/akrales_210212_4404_0160.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer promises that the TravelMate can survive “the bumps from airport security, accidental drops, and other mishaps.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Ct2GXY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10401463"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y64T5g"&gt;The TravelMate also includes some business-specific features including a TPM 2.0 chip and Acer’s ProShield security software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7cCAv"&gt;In other, less business-y areas, though, the TravelMate has a few shortcomings. Shoppers looking for anything more than portability out of the chassis may be disappointed. While most of the TravelMate is made of magnesium-aluminum alloy, it has a bit of a plasticky feel — and while the keyboard is sturdy, there’s considerable flex in the screen. And then there’s the aesthetic: the P6 is far from the prettiest computer you can buy for $1,199.99. It’s almost entirely black, with very few accents (and the ones it has are a drab gray color). And the bezels around the 16:9 screen are quite chunky by modern standards. Plus, the 16:9 aspect ratio is falling out of fashion for a reason — it’s cramped for multitasking, especially on a 13- or 14-inch screen — and the panel maxed out at 274 nits in my testing, which is a bit too dim for outdoor use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 open from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wOJHizhsI--3l9oN9_F0xFuXBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310326/akrales_210212_4404_0199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The color is called “mild black.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BIx0B"&gt;The TravelMate looks and feels like it was made a bit better than budget fare. But it also looks and feels closer to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21815008/acer-aspire-5-review-2020-15-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Aspire 5&lt;/a&gt; than it does to a top ThinkPad. For context, you can get an Aspire 5 with identical specs to this TravelMate model for &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAcer-Aspire-5-15-6-Full-HD-Laptop-Intel-Core-i5-i5-10210U-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Pure-Silver-A515-54-55AA%2F270762147" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just over $700&lt;/a&gt;. Another comparison: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 5&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous consumer laptop that’s even lighter than the TravelMate, can be purchased with comparable specs for just &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-5-laptop-sf514-55ta-56ch%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.A6SAA.002&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999.99&lt;/a&gt;. This is all to emphasize that you’re sacrificing a bit of build quality (as well as some extra money) for the TravelMate’s weight and business-specific offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPPyoQ"&gt;The touchpad is also not my favorite. For one, I had some palm-rejection issues. Those didn’t interfere with my work per se, but it was still unnerving to see my cursor jumping around the screen while I was typing. In addition, the touchpad on my unit had a bit of give before the actuation point, meaning one click required me to make (and hear) what felt like two clicks. And its off-center placement meant that I was constantly right-clicking when I meant to left-click, and I had to consciously reach over to the left side in order to click with my right hand. Finally, the click itself is shallow and far from the most comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SHbN2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10401475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjXqQG"&gt;I also didn’t love the power button. It contains a fingerprint sensor, which worked quite well. But the button itself is stiff and very shallow. I know this sounds like a small nitpick, but it was really irksome and made turning the TravelMate on in the morning more of a hassle than it could’ve been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 on a small table open, angled slightly to the right, seen from above.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some TravelMate models support facial recognition, but my model did not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XPp0Xo"&gt;The TravelMate model that I received to review is sold out everywhere I’ve looked as of this writing. The closest model to it is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Ftravelmate-p6-laptop-tmp614-51-g2-5442%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.VNNAA.001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed at $1,199.99&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s cheaper through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Facer-travelmate-p6-tmp614-51-g2-5442-14-notebook-intel-i5-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-windows-10-pro%2Fproduct_IM17TW838%3FstoreId%3D10001%26AID%3D13957703%26PID%3D5735146%26SID%3Ds1616083156788ylu0a52402%26cvosrc%3Daffiliate.cj.5735146%26cvo_campaign%3DOther%26cm_mmc%3DCJ-_-5735146-_-5735146-_-13957703%26CID%3DAFF%253A5735146%253A5735146%253A13957703%26CJPIXEL%3DCJPIXEL%26cjevent%3D934e17b288cb11eb8113005b0a1c0e14%26dclid%3DCMa8n4LcvO8CFUMY5wodQrQAfw%26userEnv%3D%26tenantId%3DStaplesDotCom%26locale%3Den-US%26zipCode%3D87101%26channel%3DWEB%26encode%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some retailers&lt;/a&gt;) and comes with a Core i5-10310U, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. My unit is the same, but it has a Core i5-10210U. Those processors &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/i5-10310U-vs-i5-10210U-vs-i7-10610U_12202_11459_12200.247596.0.html?fbclid=IwAR3TMjcPI7DXrVhIGYQ4Uw8lomm0hhCT1liBp57AKjyp6iw5nSDpGrRyt-o"&gt;don’t have a significant performance difference&lt;/a&gt;, so my testing here should give you a good idea of what to expect from that model. You can also buy a model with a Core i7-10610U, 16GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Ftravelmate-p6-professional-laptop-tmp614-51-g2-75a5%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.VNNAA.002&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99&lt;/a&gt;. Both configurations run Windows 10 Pro and include a 1920 x 1080 non-touch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKbmhP"&gt;For my office workload of emails, spreadsheets, Zoom calls, etc., the TravelMate did just fine. I sometimes heard the fans spinning at times when my load wasn’t super heavy, but the noise wasn’t loud enough to be a problem. Note that this processor has Intel’s UHD graphics, rather than its upgraded Iris Xe graphics, which means the system wouldn’t be a good choice for gaming, video software, or other graphics work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aE7rMX"&gt;But there’s one area where the TravelMate really impressed, and it’s one that’s quite useful for travelers: battery life. Running through my daily workload at 200 nits of brightness, my system averaged nine hours and 15 minutes of continuous use. That’s almost twice what the budget Aspire 5 got with my same workload. It also beats the Swift 5 and the pricier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;. If your workload is similar to (or lighter than) mine, you should be able to bring this device around an airport or conference for a full work day without being attached to a wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 seen open from the front. The screen displays a blue and yellow pattern on a black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxlyeWniBL4LoS_4QJWS31gcrxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310320/akrales_210212_4404_0132.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The notebook can charge up to 50 percent in less than 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1fOxof"&gt;One performance complaint, though: this thing comes with bloatware. My unit was pre-installed with all kinds of junk, including games (Amazon was pinned to the taskbar) and other software like Dropbox. Most annoyingly, it came with Norton, which bugged me with annoying pop-ups all the time and also seemed to impact battery life: the TravelMate consistently lasted around an hour longer after I uninstalled the program. It doesn’t take too long to uninstall everything, but I’m still morally put off by the idea of so much cheap crapware being loaded onto a laptop that costs over $1,000. And it’s especially troubling to see on a business laptop, because it can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.kaspersky.com%2Fresource-center%2Fdefinitions%2Fwhat-is-bloatware&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expose users to cybersecurity risk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeMNxV"&gt;The TravelMate line is filling a pretty specific niche, and it fills it just fine. If you’re a frequent business traveler who needs a light device with plentiful ports and all-day battery life, you’re shopping in the $1,199 price range, and you’re willing to overlook a mediocre touchpad, dim 16:9 display, and other hiccups, then the P6 will be a better choice for you than something like a pricier and heavier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell Latitude&lt;/a&gt; or the shorter-lived and port-starved ThinkPad X1 Nano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Acer Travelmate P6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B8rAJJN0_6Z35H4i8PvQCg-9uYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310317/akrales_210212_4404_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MicroSD slot, USB-A, Ethernet, lock slot on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Acer Travelmate P6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_-xjON34R-xfaD0cocucyoLWPnU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310316/akrales_210212_4404_0069.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audio jack, HDMI, USB-A, USB-C, and power port on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LqF02K"&gt;That said, the P6 has enough drawbacks that I think the bulk of customers would be better served by other laptops. Those who like the Acer brand may like some of Acer’s other offerings — especially those who don’t need the business-specific security features. The Swift 5 is lighter, nicer-looking, and more affordable than the TravelMate, with a better touchpad, screen, and processor. And budget shoppers can find much of what the TravelMate offers in any number of cheaper laptops. The Aspire 5 and the Swift 3 don’t have the TravelMate’s battery or port selection, but they do improve upon its touchpad, audio (in the Aspire’s case), and looks (in the Swift’s case). And, of course, there’s a litany of other laptops in this price range — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s Spectre x360&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; — that are excellent in almost every way and also offer 3:2 screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MpIMSB"&gt;Ultimately, the TravelMate isn’t a bad laptop — but if it’s the best laptop for you, you probably know who you are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer logo on the lid of the Acer Travelmate P6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_ok43uBmQv3_PIKmEnpjuOaWa0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310323/akrales_210212_4404_0155.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s long-lasting but mediocre in other ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
