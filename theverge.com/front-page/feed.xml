    <title>Logitech’s G435 is a lightweight, feature-packed wireless gaming headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrZQc_LAoT9-GSZoKVWPtpYeWP8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855140/g435hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PC/PlayStation headset that uses beamforming mics instead of a boom mic.&lt;/em&gt; | Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="os91UD"&gt;Many of Logitech’s previous wireless gaming headsets cost more than $100, but its latest is a relative bargain without compromising too much on comfort or features. The G435 Lightspeed costs $80, comes in three colorways, and can connect wirelessly to a PC or PlayStation console via its USB dongle, and to a phone, tablet, or other devices via a low-latency Bluetooth connection (Logitech didn’t share specific millisecond latency specs in time for publication). The headset will be available sometime in September 2021 from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FLogitechG.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22665355%2Flogitech-g435-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebxt3D"&gt;Its design picks up where the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21378026/logitech-g733-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-accessories-g203-g305-g915-colors"&gt;G733 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; left off, with lots of color, breathable mesh fabric, and plastic all around. There are some differences, both cosmetic and functional. Logitech says the G435 Lightspeed was designed primarily for smaller heads, as it’s angling this model to a younger generation. Though, it still fits my large-sized head easily. The ear cups are on rails that allow for easy adjustment, whether you want to make them fit a bigger or smaller head.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rg3LVNmrhXX4AVBxNK0J5yhkN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839633/g435black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the buttons are on the left ear cup. From top to bottom, there’s the power button, volume up / down, the mute on the bottom. Holding mute toggles between 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NhbMB2"&gt;The G435 Lightspeed looks like a traditional wireless gaming headset, except for one major omission: a boom microphone. That’s not to say it doesn’t have a mic at all. Instead of having a physical mic, Logitech employed dual beamforming microphones built into the left earcup that aim to achieve similar results without having a mic right in front of your mouth. During my week of testing, it did a good job picking up my voice and leaving out the sound from my noisy window air conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM2e62"&gt;This may be the lightest gaming headset that I’ve worn yet, weighing 165 grams. The frame and headband are mostly plastic throughout, but Logitech nailed two important aspects about fit: making sure the headset doesn’t feel like it’s weighing down on your head or clamping around your ears too hard. Impressively, there’s barely any cushioning around the headband, just a thin piece of breathable fabric wrapped around it. Yet, there were no issues regarding comfort during my time with the G435. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6y5rgyAFCxIopPLISwvn1Nk8t8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839639/g435blue.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blue and pink colorway shown here is the most vibrant option available for the G435.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zC5y7u"&gt;It’s understandable that for $80 the G435’s build materials might come into question. And yes, with the headset in hand, it feels well-constructed but a little on the chintzy side. To Logitech’s credit, the sound quality is quite a bit better than I expected from a headset at this price, to the point where I didn’t really care about any quibbles I had with the build materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x713Y3"&gt;Rounding up a few more specs, this model charges via USB-C and claims to reach up to 18 hours of battery life per charge. To switch between getting audio from the included USB dongle and Bluetooth, the G435 requires you to manually swap sources by holding the mute button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiNI1E"&gt;If you’re in the market for an affordable wireless gaming headset, the number of options worth checking out is growing, thankfully. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android"&gt;Razer Barracuda X&lt;/a&gt; launching for $100, and this model coming in at $80, it’s easier now to find a console-friendly headset that won’t break the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi shows off concept smart glasses with MicroLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlLevqZCaH7sItrH6DbunnggfcQ=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855085/_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osgDd9"&gt;Xiaomi has announced a pair of smart glasses called Xiaomi Smart Glasses. A company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there’s no plan to actually put them on sale, but Xiaomi has provided enough detail to make the concept product seem somewhat plausible — at least for some point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIuBiE"&gt;Xiaomi’s glasses have a relatively conventional form factor, but unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Facebook and Ray Ban’s just-announced Stories glasses&lt;/a&gt;, they actually do have a display that can be used for AR features. Xiaomi says it went with a monochrome MicroLED system because of its “higher pixel density and longer lifespan while having a simpler structure” when compared to OLED. According to Xiaomi, MicroLED “allows for a more compact display, as well as easier screen integration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSTCwS"&gt;MicroLED is a self-emissive display technology that is widely viewed as the natural successor to OLED. However, it remains prohibitively expensive and is yet to be deployed in more than a handful of commercial products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVsO9egW8M7X5pnQ5DzBu-aa9bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849119/WX20210914_095340.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XqJOjA"&gt;Xiaomi’s display is “roughly the size of a grain of rice” at 2.4mm x 2.02mm and has a peak brightness of 2 million nits. The light won’t be that bright once it actually reaches your eye, of course — the extreme brightness is so it can still be visible in direct sunlight after passing through an optical waveguide lens, which refracts and directs the light. Xiaomi cites use cases like navigation, live translation, and notifications for the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sykuZE"&gt;The glasses themselves are an independent Android device that don’t require a constant phone connection — Xiaomi suggests they could even replace your phone someday. There’s an unspecified quad-core Arm processor, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules, a battery, and a five-megapixel camera on board. Xiaomi says the glasses weigh just 51 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C92kDP"&gt;As mentioned upfront, these glasses aren’t going to be available to the public and may not actually even exist, so you should view Xiaomi’s claims with skepticism. However, coming after Facebook’s announcement and right before Apple’s iPhone event, the concept demonstration is a clear indicator that Xiaomi wants to be considered as a player in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter won’t act on Nicki Minaj tweet irresponsibly linking COVID-19 vaccine to impotency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - February 12, 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hb83PdS5sTas-9Pq4lhtZWp_Kic=/0x0:3054x2036/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854588/1205847816.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Pierre Suu/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPFRTJ"&gt;Twitter has committed to labeling tweets containing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307919/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-labels-five-strike-system"&gt;misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, but the company says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437532566945341441"&gt;a recent Nicki Minaj tweet&lt;/a&gt; which claimed that “the vaccine” made her cousin’s friend impotent does not violate its rules. There is no known scientific evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause a fertility problem in men or women; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html"&gt;the CDC dedicates an entire page to debunking those fears&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPACMB"&gt;“My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it &amp;amp; became impotent,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437532566945341441"&gt;Minaj tweeted&lt;/a&gt; to her 22.6 million followers. “His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it &amp;amp; make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision, not bullied.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3kfXU8396KIYpEQUg5e_M9uwoXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848714/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_6.09.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweet by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437532566945341441" target="_blank"&gt;Nicki Minaj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H4yFv3"&gt;While Minaj clearly suggests her followers should consider their decision to get the vaccine based on this information, it’s unclear whether any doctor traced her cousin’s friend’s condition back to a vaccine as the culprit or saw a larger pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZiLMU"&gt;When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Twitter spokesperson wrote “the Tweets you referenced are not in violation of the Twitter Rules.” While we only asked about a single tweet, Minaj has posted many tweets Monday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437526877808128000"&gt;discussing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437539494664626177"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437543611717931009"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. In one, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437534182117306368"&gt;she noted&lt;/a&gt; that “I’m sure I’ll b vaccinated” because of her need to tour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Q0M51iaG0o-drGknDB0GqEOmE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848719/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_6.11.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweet by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1437534182117306368" target="_blank"&gt;Nicki Minaj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmOBN4"&gt;Twitter has a number of functions in place intended to prevent the spread of COVID misinformation on the platform. In August, it launched a new feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629097/twitter-misinformation-health-covid19-reporting-feature-white-house"&gt;to let people report COVID misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eObzIG"&gt;Minaj’s tweet currently carries no label pointing to scientific information about the COVID-19 vaccine, but people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;in Twitter’s Birdwatch program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users fact-check tweets, have left over a dozen notes on the tweet about how the tweet is potentially misleading. However, Birdwatch is still in a limited pilot right now, meaning the significant majority of Twitter users can’t see those fact checks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is rolling out an Android 12 beta to Galaxy S21 owners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="One UI 4 on the Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gIQ6byUp17YH8jnX69KydrKCeE4=/318x0:3695x2251/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854576/01_one_ui_4_beta_press_release_widget_customization.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One UI 4 on the Galaxy S21 | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fOUTTz"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/3nsjCz3"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s rolling out a public beta of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; for Galaxy S21 devices, just a few weeks ahead of when we expect the final OS to be officially available for the first time on Pixel phones. Samsung is touting that it is managing to get these betas out earlier every year, though this year it’s only by a week or two compared to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQcmPH"&gt;Registration for the beta program will begin on September 14th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;the same day the iPhone 13 is announced&lt;/a&gt;. Users will need to register in the Samsung Members app to try it — and if Samsung repeats the past, the number of open slots will be limited. It’s only available in the U.S. as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARP3na"&gt;The beta is actually for Samsung’s One UI 4, its version of Android. That distinction is important because one of the major changes in Android 12 is how different it looks. On a Pixel phone, all the buttons are big and the colors change dynamically based on your wallpaper, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;a style Google’s calling “Material You.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="One UI 4 privacy settings and notifications" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Bbv0lK_QeX7Yk6u3HQW1r1-OHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848663/oneui4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;One UI 4 privacy settings and notifications&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LQ6w9B"&gt;On a Galaxy S21 phone, we don’t yet know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how much of Google’s design language Samsung intends to use.  One UI already had lots of theming options — and Samsung’s store was chock full of more users could buy (though most are fairly garish). Sure enough, Samsungs rundown of what’s new in One UI 4 specifically calls out “theme options.” Here is Samsung’s official list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9WAc"&gt;A wealth of theme options let you adjust the look and functionality of your device, giving you tools to configure your home screen, icons, notifications, wallpapers and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPR0O9"&gt;Redesigned, upgraded widgets offer deep customization — from visibility to appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJG6A3"&gt;You also get convenient access to a more robust and diverse array of emojis all in one place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WdwpsT"&gt;Samsung also is adopting Android 12’s visual indicators for when the microphone and camera are in use. It will also have toggles for turning those sensors off completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUwi8z"&gt;New widgets will also be welcome — most of them across most versions of Android have begun feeling a little antiquated. As you can see at the top of this post, Samsung’s widgets look clean, at least, and have big rounded corners. They don’t go quite as far as Google’s new widgets, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAA0mc"&gt;As Google itself becomes more opinionated on what Android looks like on its Pixel phones with Material You, a big question will be whether those opinions work well on non-Google phones. Samsung itself has been moving in a relatively coherent aesthetic direction for the last few years, but it’s been one that uses more white space and larger fonts than Google’s recent designs. We can see that Samsung is adopting some of the bigger, bubbly rounded corners for notifications, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpcY5l"&gt;Are the two looks compatible? Will Google widgets look out of place on a Samsung homescreen? Will Samsung adopt the new locations for various Android system functions that have been moved? Galaxy S21 owners will find out soon enough as they dig deeper into the pubic beta.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 on the Pixel 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P90YgdXDdWW1P3VSYbBXQhVEW_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520874/1._Android_12_Keyword_Header.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart on a rocky year for the app </title>

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syZjy923Th1ut4wxrXyxigbcOik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854535/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A candid Q&amp;amp;A on encryption, privacy, and ProPublica&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Nva9NY"&gt;It has been a contentious year for WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEuuUt"&gt;In January, a simple effort to update its terms of service to enable some commerce features &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/inside-the-whatsapp-privacy-freakout"&gt;triggered a massive backlash in India&lt;/a&gt;, helping its rival Signal to &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/-the-battle-inside-signal"&gt;double its user base in a month&lt;/a&gt;. In May, the Facebook-owned messaging app sued India over new rules issued by the country’s IT ministry that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-whatsapp-sues-india-govt-says-new-media-rules-mean-end-privacy-sources-2021-05-26/"&gt;could break end-to-end encryption around the globe&lt;/a&gt;. And just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users"&gt;a widely read report in &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drew attention to the service’s use of human reviewers to investigate potential violations of WhatsApp’s terms of service, in part by reading the five most recent messages in any reported exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10ezgU"&gt;Writing about &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;’s story, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-propublicas-investigation-into"&gt;I took exception to the idea&lt;/a&gt; that allowing users to report bad actors is necessarily bad for privacy. (After publication, &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; added an editor’s note saying it had altered some language in the story to clarify that a user reporting feature does not break encryption.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjdD0O"&gt;A few days later, the company announced the introduction of a way to let you encrypt a backup of your WhatsApp messages, preventing anyone who doesn’t have your encryption key (or, alternatively, a password that you set) from reading the contents of any of your messages. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Alex Heath has a nice technical overview of&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22665968/whatsapp-backups-end-to-end-encryption-ios-android"&gt; how this works&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="F7ZUAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WhatsApp is adding encrypted backups","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22665968/whatsapp-backups-end-to-end-encryption-ios-android"},{"title":"WhatsApp sues Indian government over new rules it says break encryption","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SX2seI"&gt;All these issues are the purview of Will Cathcart, who took over WhatsApp in March 2019. Cathcart, who joined parent company Facebook in 2010 after a stint at Google, previously oversaw Facebook’s almighty News Feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlKOMw"&gt;The jobs are very different, but both have involved high-stakes global political battles about speech and democracy. On Monday morning, I caught up with Cathcart over Zoom about privacy, encryption, and the future of messaging. I also asked him if he ever wished he had an easier job. “I love my job,” he assured me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afb8zL"&gt;Highlights of our conversation follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ul2K9v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBoXrc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casey Newton: On Friday you announced that WhatsApp is introducing encrypted backups for its users on Android and iOS. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llF0Gf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Cathcart&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re always focused on what we can do to protect the privacy of people’s messages. People’s messages are very sensitive. And the reality is that over time there are growing threats to people’s privacy — hackers, hostile governments, criminals. And so we’re always looking at how can we add more privacy, especially around the theme of protecting what you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQPpNE"&gt;We’ve had end-to-end encryption for five years, which means if you send a message to someone on WhatsApp, we can’t see what you sent as it passes through all of our servers. It’s completely secure. We think that’s really important. But the reality is there’s other things we can do to protect people’s messages. One is to actually help people’s messages not live forever. We launched disappearing messages late last year, because when I talk to you in person, we don’t usually keep a transcript of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWyGLB"&gt;Another area we’ve been looking at for a while is backups. Many people don’t back up their messages, but a lot of people do. And you can opt into backup on Google or iCloud if you have an Android or an iPhone. We wanted to see if we could find a way to add the same level of end-to-end encrypted security that you get when you send a message across WhatsApp to those backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEd9WW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you do it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tYE3o"&gt;That is a hard problem, because if you back up your message in a truly end-to-end encrypted way, you have to have a password for it, and if you lose your password or your phone, you really have no way to get them back. We don’t have some way to help you if you lose them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cueO6a"&gt;So what we took a long time figuring out how to do was, how can we do this in a way that we felt would be accessible such that a lot of people would be able to use it? And what we’ve come up with is there’s two options you can choose. One is you can keep a 64-digit key, and you can keep that yourself — you can print it out, you can write it down, or you can try to remember it, but I wouldn’t recommend it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIGsjd"&gt;Or if that’s too intimidating or too hard, which we think it will be for a lot of people, we’ve come up with a system where we’ll store the key for you using hardware security modules, which means we don’t have a way to access it. And you can come up with a shorter, easier-to-remember passphrase to get access to it. And that I think will help make this more accessible for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y23E0f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you mentioned, in recent years we’ve seen stories about state-sponsored hackers attempting to access the WhatsApp messages of government officials, diplomats, activists, journalists, and human rights activists, among others. Are backups part of that story? Are they in the threat model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxKOwA"&gt;Yes, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8CHt7"&gt;In some of the stories around&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cyber-whatsapp-nsogroup/whatsapp-sues-israels-nso-for-allegedly-helping-spies-hack-phones-around-the-world-idUSKBN1X82BE"&gt; spyware companies&lt;/a&gt;, the most worrying version of this is where they get full access to your phone. But it’s absolutely a threat that people could try to get access to your backups. There was just&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-23/icloud-photo-theft-nude-women"&gt; a story in the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago about a predator who was using social engineering get access to women’s backups just to try to look through their photos. There was some horrifying number of people affected by that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl5HC9"&gt;The reality is, people have really sensitive stuff in what they say and what they send. We think we’ve got to look at all the ways that there could be a threat to them, and if in any case we can find an interesting or novel way to protect it, add it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J48Jb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So on one hand, WhatsApp now offers a stronger degree of protection to users here than some other encrypted messengers, like Apple’s iMessage, which doesn’t encrypt its backups. But WhatsApp came in for criticism last week over the fact that it allows users to report each other, and to include recent messages in the reports they submit. And those reports — and messages — are reviewed by humans. How did that system come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iL6Iqj"&gt;We’ve had the ability for people to report for a long time. And look, we just disagree with the criticism here. If you and I have a private conversation, that’s private — [but] that doesn’t mean you don’t have the right to go complain to someone if I say something harassing, offensive, or dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OcDCtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Encryption] doesn’t mean you don’t have the right to go complain to someone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="84gNJ9"&gt;That’s how the real world works: in the real world, two people can have a private conversation and then one of them can go ask for help and relay what they were told if they need to. I just think that matches how normal people communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQSJ19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like here we’ve really hit on how “privacy” seems to be a word that is understood differently by every person using it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csdneE"&gt;For what it’s worth, in this area — I haven’t heard people who use WhatsApp tell me they think the idea that we let people report is a problem. I do think there’s some really hard questions around privacy and technology and where are the lines, and things like that. But this one isn’t something I’ve seen actual people who use WhatsApp have a lot of concern about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwXAdp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the ways that you feel that user reporting benefits WhatsApp?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5P4yeu"&gt;The clearest high-level way it benefits us is that it helps us run the service with reduced amounts of spam. This is a service with 2 billion users. That is a big global system. Unfortunately, there are going to be some people who are going to try to abuse it — send out spam, send out phishing messages, send out things that are trying to make the experience for people less safe. And the fact that people can report is one of the most powerful techniques we have to catch that stuff. We’re able to ban millions of accounts a month based on [those reports].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPxduc"&gt;Again, we can’t see the messages people send, but we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see when someone reports to us. We think it’s okay for you to report a spammer. And then we can use that to ban people and help keep the service more safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLflyE"&gt;And then there’s other, more rare but very meaningful problems to try to work on — for example, the sharing of child exploitative imagery. We think we’ve found a way to have an end-to-end encrypted system that has the level of security people need for their private messages — but uses things like reports, and some of the metadata we have, to ban people who appear to be sharing childhood exploitative imagery. And in some cases, make actual referrals to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We made something like 400,000 referrals last year, and that’s powered by reports. I think that’s very consistent with people’s model of privacy: if I send you something and you think it’s a problem and you want to ask for help, you should be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASIZrq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I talked to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProPublica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s president about all this, and he said look: at the end of the day, this company is saying that WhatsApp messages are totally private, when in fact in some cases they’re reviewed by humans. Do you think most of your users understand that dynamic, or could you do more there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLj9R0"&gt;I think people get this. There’s not confusion or concern from the people who actually use WhatsApp. Anyone who uses WhatsApp can go in and hit the report button, and it gets used a lot. It’s really transparent when you do that, that it’s going to send messages to us. So this whole particular criticism did surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHJOp9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wrote last week that WhatApp’s encryption-plus-reporting approach seemed to be trying to find a workable middle ground in a world where encryption is under threat. The services that provide it are probably going to have to make &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sort of concessions to the government. And so how do you maximally protect encryption while also enabling at least some kind of interfacing with law enforcement to catch the worst actors? Is this how you see it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySthki"&gt;I think about it a little differently. End-to-end encryption protects all of our users. It protects them by keeping their messages secure, while on top of that — letting people tell us if someone’s spamming protects our users. It’s usually framed as like, “are you picking privacy or are you picking safety?” I see this as the same thing — end-to-end encryption is one of most powerful technologies we have to protect people’s safety all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4LFMU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is making you comfortable that on balance, the benefits of the encryption you provide outweigh any harms that may be caused by people sort of having access to these protected systems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO7gPJ"&gt;I would say two things. One is, I just see the trends on all the threats going on around the world. And I think through, years from now, what are the consequences if we don’t have secure protection for our data? Especially in liberal societies, in a world where hostile governments have a very different worldview about privacy and information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQ8Iwh"&gt;And two, one thing I find helpful is thinking through real-world analogs. A lot of stuff feels so new that the debates feel very new, but the real-world equivalents, they’re not new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JSmuyQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Most people have an instinctive horrified reaction. I think that’s telling.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hxnhai"&gt;People have been able to meet in private in person and talk privately for hundreds and hundreds of years, and there’s no automatic system keeping a backup. There’s no automatic system relaying it to a company. And I think that’s been a good thing. Sometimes when you look at some of the proposals on breaking encryption, or traceability in India, or scanning every private photo against the database, and you just apply it to “Hey, how would you feel about doing this in people’s living rooms?” Most people have an instinctive horrified reaction. I think that’s telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owH7g1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the current global situation around end-to-end encryption globally. You’re currently suing the Indian government over new regulations that would require you to trace the originator of individual messages, and to filter messages based on what they contain. Presumably this would apply to encrypted backups as well. What’s at stake here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejaryY"&gt;With the IT rules in India, the specific thing those rules would require is us to build some system [to comply] if someone comes to us and says “Hey, someone said the words ‘XYZ.’ Tell us who the first person is who said the words XYZ.” That’s not private. And it undermines the security that end-to-end encryption provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zVbwF"&gt;I think 10 years from now, even more of our lives will be online. Even more of our sensitive data will be online. There will be even more sophisticated hackers, spyware companies, hostile governments, criminals trying to get access to it. And not having the best security means that information is stolen. I think that has real consequences for free society. If journalists’ information is being stolen, which we saw in some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;reporting around NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, I think that undermines the free press. If people who want to organize can’t communicate in private, I think that undermines their ability to advocate for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RHKqn"&gt;I think there’s a lot of core tenets of democracy and liberalism that actually rely on people being able to have private information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfpJgK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say you lose in India. Does that break encryption in WhatsApp globally, or can you contain the fallout to India somehow — and maybe eventually in other countries who might adopt similar rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeyjpE"&gt;You know, I don’t have a crystal ball. My hope is that over the next few years, increasingly governments will realize that on balance, the more important thing for them to do is protect their citizens’ data. That the threats are growing, and so their interest in protecting people’s security is higher, and therefore they’ll be dismissive of what some other countries are asking for. But I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IiSFr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to try to ask it again, though. If India says, “Sorry, Will, you lose on this one, you have to build this awful system.” Can the damage be contained to India?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZCklK"&gt;I think that there’s a political question and there’s a technical question. The way they wrote the rules, and what they’ve said, is that they only want it to apply it to people in India. But I think there’s a broader political question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWW1Jv"&gt;The more some countries see other countries do it, or push for it, the more they want to push for it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Hza4f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever long for the days when you had an easier job, like running the Facebook News Feed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KfyRc"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;) I love my job. I get that there are going to be questions. I get that when we launch things like end-to-end encrypted backups, there are going to be some people who criticize it. But at the end of the day I just feel so lucky to get to work on something that so many people love and use for stuff that’s so important.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LittleBigPlanet online security issues blamed for permanent server shutdown on PS3 and Vita</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9nBxJAE9xssD8jDY3PZGpx26bM=/124x0:2188x1376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854067/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_1.25.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="if6FU4"&gt;Sony has permanently shut down the servers for the original three &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt; games on Playstation 3 and the handheld &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt; on the Playstation Vita, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1437415883752845318?s=20"&gt;according to a tweet&lt;/a&gt; posted by the official LittleBigPlanet account on Monday (&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/little-big-planet-1-2-3-ps3-vita-online-servers-shutting-down"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2BHav"&gt;The new status quo leaves the originally PS3 trilogy of &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt; games and the Vita version playable &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1437422130711379970?s=20"&gt;as offline single-player or co-op experiences only&lt;/a&gt;, with purchased and already downloaded DLC also usable. Any user-created content — the most intriguing aspect of Sony and original developer Media Molecule’s famous action-platforming series — will only be accessible &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1437418106591268866?s=20"&gt;on the newly updated Playstation 4 version of &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The server shutdown also means that anyone stuck with older PS3 versions of the games is also unable to upload or download new user-created levels from now on,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CsXZnV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An update on the LittleBigPlanet server and online services: &lt;a href="https://t.co/vUrvHcZvIs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vUrvHcZvIs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sackboy: A Big Adventure | LittleBigPlanet (@LittleBigPlanet) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1437415883752845318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IRChsL"&gt;“We have no doubt the news will come as a big disappointment to a lot of you,” Sony wrote in the statement. “Ultimately this is the best way to protect the &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt; community and to help ensure that our online community environment remains safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3jr9t"&gt;Suddenly closing up shop on &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt;’s servers appears to be motivated by Sony's ongoing difficulties with the games’ online component. In March 2020, the games’ servers were temporarily taken down due to DDoS attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-12-littlebigplanet-servers-offline-as-fans-report-ddos-attack"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Players &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/littlebigplanet/comments/ni6r6z/warning_hackers_can_display_offensive_messages/"&gt;have also reported&lt;/a&gt; offensive messages appearing in-game, seemingly placed there by hackers. &lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt;’s developers attempted to address some of the server issues with security updates in April of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/littlebigplanet-devs-break-silence-with-promise-to-restore-servers-as-soon-as-we-can"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the problem appears to be larger than something a small update can fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lns6tM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stop and update your iPhone to iOS 14.8 right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tD4CoZE3XDP5N7N3rFYqvkgwSSM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854057/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vNbyFA"&gt;Apple has released a suite of new updates for &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212807"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212804"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212806"&gt;watchOS&lt;/a&gt; to fix a bug that &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/"&gt;security researchers at Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; say was very likely exploited to allow government agencies to install spyware into the phones of journalists, lawyers, and activists. The researchers say the bug allowed for a “zero-click” install (meaning the target didn’t have to do anything to be infected) of the Pegasus spyware, which is reportedly capable of stealing data, passwords, and activating a phone’s microphone or camera. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;our explainer of Pegusus here&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghtgyJ"&gt;Given the severity of the exploit, you should update to iOS 14.8, macOS Big Sur 11.6, and watchOS 7.6.2 as soon as you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDzdFG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s update page says it’s “aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11sjdQ"&gt;We heard about the exploit in August, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/"&gt;when Citizen Lab reported&lt;/a&gt; that it had been successfully used against phones running iOS 14.6 (released in May). Citizen Lab also said the vulnerability, which it codenamed “ForcedEntry,” seemed to match the behavior of an exploit Amnesty International &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;wrote about in July&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the security researchers wrote that it was made possible by a bug in Apple’s CoreGraphics system, and happened when the phone tried to use a function related to GIFs, after it received a text message containing a malicious file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY3uHD"&gt;However, even with that info, it could be difficult to pin down exactly what was happening without access to the infected files themselves. &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild"&gt;According to Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered files while re-analyzing a backup from an activist’s hacked phone. The files appeared to be GIFs sent as SMS attachments, but were actually PSDs and PDFs. (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212807"&gt;Apple’s update notes&lt;/a&gt; say that the issue occurred when processing a maliciously crafted PDF.) Citizen Lab suspected they could’ve been related to Pegasus, so it sent the files to Apple on September 7th. Apple quickly released the software updates patching the bug on September 13th, and thanked Citizen Lab in a statement for “completing the very difficult work of obtaining a sample of this exploit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IweTQR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14.8 is seemingly only focused on security&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TEuK8F"&gt;Some of Monday’s updates also fix a second security issue with WebKit for iOS and macOS Big Sur (it isn’t mentioned in the release notes for Catalina). While it’s unclear if it’s related to NSO’s exploits — its discovery is attributed to “an anonymous researcher” instead of Citizen Lab, and it’s in a different part of the system — Apple still says that it “may have been actively exploited.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWQTAy"&gt;Such an urgent security issue explains why we’re seeing a new update to iOS just a day before an Apple event, where it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;expected to announced new phones&lt;/a&gt; that will probably never run this version of the OS. Still, there have been rumors about an iOS 14.8 release &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/09/ios-14-8-release-date-information-rumor/"&gt;since early August&lt;/a&gt;, but given that Monday’s release seems to only deal with the security issues discovered in September, it’s possible we’ll see at least one more iOS 14 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="55m3eu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Keep your devices up-to-date&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLzesV"&gt;CoreGraphics’ PDF rendering seems to have been problematic recently when it comes to security. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212601"&gt;iOS 14.7 also included a fix&lt;/a&gt; for a seemingly separate issue with the system, which could also lead to arbitrary code execution. WebKit has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;recently had&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;few updates&lt;/a&gt; to fix security issues that Apple says “may have been actively exploited.” When news of the CoreGraphics exploit broke in August, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was working on improving security for iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaocFK"&gt;All of this serves as a reminder about how important it is to keep all your devices up-to-date. While you hopefully never find yourself on the bad side of a government using advanced spyware, it’s still a good idea to make sure that your device isn’t vulnerable to widely-reported security exploits. Thankfully, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-android-fragmentation-with-ios-15/"&gt;planning on letting&lt;/a&gt; users install security updates for iOS 14 without having to upgrade to iOS 15, which could be useful for any future fixes. For the time being, though, get all your devices updated as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1LRoB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 13th, 7:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added quote from Apple’s statement thanking Citizen Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sennheiser’s latest true wireless earbuds offer noise cancellation for less</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fjAYCKwPOpEDNgmdPQY9H4PLPLI=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854024/ezgif_7_8ac862e63642.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds will be available later this month in either black or white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sennheiser&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atFaDc"&gt;Sennheiser’s CX Plus true wireless earbuds aren’t its first pair to offer noise cancellation, but it’s the first time the feature has appeared on its more affordable CX range. At $179, the CX Plus are more expensive than the $129 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fcx-true-wireless&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671228%2Fsennheiser-cx-plus-true-wireless-earbuds-noise-cancellation-release-date-news-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CX True Wireless announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, but they’re affordable compared to the flagship $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;Momentum True Wireless 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYBndB"&gt;Beyond noise cancellation, the CX Plus also include a transparent hearing mode, which uses their microphones to pass through audio from the outside world when you need to be aware of your surroundings. It’s got an IPX4 resistance to splashing water, two microphones on each earbud, and battery life that stands at a total of 24 hours when the buds are topped up from the charging case (compared to 27 hours for the cheaper CX, and 28 for the Momentum 2). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-FVwIXm1Px8ZqWBXcmu9rGbfHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846302/CX_PLUS_TW_Mood_Image_Black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sennheiser&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Combined with the charging case, the earbuds offer 24 hours of listening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ymVpsx"&gt;In terms of codecs, the earbuds support SBC, AAC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. You control the buds with touch controls, which like the EQ settings, are customizable. Interestingly, Sennheiser says both the left and right earbuds can be used individually, whereas only the right Momentum 2 earbud could be used on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j2wi8"&gt;While $179 for a pair of noise cancelling true wireless earbuds is affordable for Sennheiser, it’s still expensive compared to some other brands. Most notably, the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; offered noise cancellation for just $99 (albeit not at the same level of quality as their more expensive competition). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwRj1Z"&gt;Sennheiser’s CX Plus earbuds will go on sale on September 28th, when they’ll be available in either black or white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKSGfq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGvC3j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $850 once you add it to your cart, where additional savings will automatically apply. This matches the all-time low for this popular entry-level laptop. The 512GB configuration is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in all three colorways for $1,100, a discount of $150 that automatically applies at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRJZQQ"&gt;Although retailers like &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604825-REG%2Fapple_mgn63ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; are selling the base 256GB MacBook Air and upgraded, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; model at regular price, we have seen them drop the pricing in the past to match Amazon’s discounts. These deals can come and go quickly, though, we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The touch bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — bringing it down to $1,150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded version of the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is also $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532652589677821#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for a final sale price of $1,350.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjmE4B"&gt;While there have been rumors throughout the year of a r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;edesigned MacBook Pro, one with an M1X processor and additional ports&lt;/a&gt;, we might not see it until further into the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in two configurations at Amazon: one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999, and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. Amazon is currently offering the space gray configuration with an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FZV45H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $2,285&lt;/a&gt;, a $114 discount. There are other configurations available with more storage and speedier processors — you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FTNGNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,645 at Amaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up the 256GB model for a historical low of $600 (discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpqfyJ"&gt;As for the 512GB model, we have seen retailers such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; offer it for $100 off its usual $899 price point, but there are currently no sizable discounts to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGzBt4"&gt;Four people are set to launch to space Wednesday night aboard a SpaceX capsule, and none of them are professional astronauts. Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist, booked the Crew Dragon capsule last year and picked three normal folks to ride with him. It will be the first completely private mission to orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCy7Px"&gt;Dubbed Inspiration 4, the mission is a multimillion-dollar fundraiser for St. Jude Children’s Hospital and — like a lot of recent flights to space these days — an effort to convince those watching from the ground that space won’t be always be exclusive to government officials and the ultra-wealthy. Isaacman’s crew includes Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor and St. Jude physician assistant; Sian Proctor, a geology professor and former NASA astronaut candidate; and Christopher Sembroski, a data engineer at Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQM7Pt"&gt;The Inspiration 4 crew is slated to launch Wednesday at 8:02PM ET atop SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, buckled inside the same Crew Dragon capsule that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt; sent a four-person crew of government astronauts to the International Space Station &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22413121/spacex-crew-dragon-resilience-splashdown-nasa-record-iss"&gt;and back&lt;/a&gt;. This mission’s destination is about 80 miles higher than the ISS. In orbit, they’ll view Earth through two windows and a new glass dome that was added to the top of the capsule, where Crew Dragon’s ISS docking door was. The crew will reenter the atmosphere after three days, depending on the weather around Florida, and splash down in the Atlantic ocean. SpaceX recovery teams will likely meet up with the capsule, hoist it onto a ship, extract the crew, and bring them ashore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7pGmD"&gt;Isaacman, a trained pilot and the founder of a payment processing company, is the commander of the flight. He has said he wanted to arrange a diverse crew of passengers who weren’t billionaires. He paid for all four seats on Crew Dragon, and dropped the first $100 million of a $200 million fundraiser for St. Jude, a nonprofit research facility and hospital that provides free care to children with cancer. Isaacman reserved two of the seats for St. Jude — one would go to the winner of a fundraising campaign and the other would go to Arceneaux, who works at St. Jude as a physician assistant in Memphis, Tennessee and will serve as the mission’s medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TeC6S"&gt;Arceneaux, 29, is a childhood cancer survivor who will become the first person with a prosthetic body part to launch to space. Metal rods were placed in the part of her left leg that had a cancerous tumor as a child. Sembroski, the Lockheed engineer, will occupy the seat reserved for the winning participant of the St. Jude fundraising campaign. A friend of Sembroski’s won, but couldn’t go on the trip and passed the ticket to him instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsVlKe"&gt;The fourth seat went to Sian Proctor, the winner of a contest hosted by Shift4, the payment company owned by Isaacman. Contestants had to create a &lt;a href="https://myspace2inspire.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; using Shift4 software and produce a short &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrSianProctor/status/1365148498509791234?s=20"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of themselves explaining why they wanted to go to space. Proctor, 51, taught geology at a community college in Phoenix, Arizona and will become the fourth Black woman, and the first person from Guam, to go to space. In 2009, she got close to becoming a NASA astronaut as one of nine finalists in a monthslong, notoriously difficult selection process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5se8tW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10749753"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="avQt4C"&gt;The crew has been training since March, about seven months before liftoff. That includes centrifuge training to get used to the enormous G-forces of lifting off atop a rocket, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inspiration4x/status/1414624789860282372?s=20"&gt;microgravity experience&lt;/a&gt; aboard a Zero-G flight, and weeks of training at SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California to familiarize the passengers with Crew Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zijbjY"&gt;Besides the passengers’ personal mementos, like family items and school memorabilia, the mission is full of sponsorships: 66 pounds of hops are on board Crew Dragon that, once returned to Earth, will be used to brew beer by Samuel Adams, “the official beer of Inspiration4,” the mission group said in a press release, adding the brewer made “a maximum $100,000 donation to St. Jude.” All the passengers will wear branded watches, Sembroski will play an onboard ukulele from Martin Guitar, and a bunch of other things on board will get auctioned off once they’re back on the ground as part of the ongoing St. Jude fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e29McH"&gt;If all goes as planned, Inspiration 4 will mark the first fully private mission for SpaceX, which developed its Crew Dragon spacecraft as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. That program funded development of two competing space capsules — Crew Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner — to serve as NASA astronauts’ ride to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DFfw2Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“like watching your kids graduate from college”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="me7zyV"&gt;For the Commercial Crew Program, NASA is a customer — not an owner — of the spacecraft, much like Isaacman is the main customer for Inspiration4. A core goal behind the program was to help stimulate a market for commercial spaceflight, awarding SpaceX roughly $3 billion and Boeing roughly $5 billion to help get started. Boeing’s Starliner has yet to launch humans. But Isaacman’s mission, which will mark the fourth crewed flight for SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, a key intent of NASA’s program, has come to fruition. As NASA’s human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders recently said in the &lt;a href="https://www.wmfe.org/category/are-we-there-yet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are We There Yet?&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Inspiration 4 “is like watching your kids graduate from college.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd2pjl"&gt;But whether private space tourism will &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;be accessible to a larger swath of passengers remains to be seen. A seat on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon costs roughly $55 million, and a seat on Starliner is somewhere around $90 million, according to government watchdog reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLTVrE"&gt;For a shorter experience, other companies like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are offering brief suborbital jaunts to the edge of space — but these are still extremely expensive. Right now, Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611847/virgin-galactic-ticket-sales-richard-branson"&gt;charges $450,000&lt;/a&gt; for a seat on its SpaceShipTwo, which flies some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;53 miles high for a few minutes of weightlessness&lt;/a&gt; and views of Earth’s curvature. Blue Origin hasn’t announced prices for a seat aboard its suborbital New Shepard rocket, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;launches about 66 miles above ground&lt;/a&gt; for a similar experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hvx0jw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“in order to get to the endpoint we want, you have to go through this initial step”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R15a0u"&gt;With Isaacman footing the multimillion-dollar bill for his three fellow passengers’ tickets to space, and both Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic flying highly publicized back-to-back missions, the space tourism industry is in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;phase buoyed by billionaire backers&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-wealthy customers. Getting out of this phase, as industry figures have said, will require drastic drops in the cost of building and launching rockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyKbF3"&gt;“We’ve been hearing that for so long, that until it happens, it’s not unusual that people are a little skeptical about that,” says Alan Ladwig, who in the 1980s led NASA’s &lt;a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19860031168"&gt;Space Flight Participant Program&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative to send civilian storytellers like teachers and journalists to space as a way to get the public excited about human spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2owtpI"&gt;“But in order to get to the endpoint we want, you have to go through this initial step, with the early adopters and paying higher costs to go in order to eventually lower the cost,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
