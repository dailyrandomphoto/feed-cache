    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OzekPZTFqvEC621SgVNqNxikdec=/5x0:1460x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182339/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_2.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting the LG C1 OLED TV won’t be cheap, but it’s among the best options out there.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Black Friday hits and Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Black Friday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as breaking it down on a category level.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UhATMC"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uKqmoG9m" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung 55-inch Q60A QLED TV&lt;/a&gt; is $700 at Best Buy, down from $800. This model is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08VWBF7C1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11QJho"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uM0X6Nan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 65-inch Q80A QLED TV&lt;/a&gt; with full-array local dimming is $1,200 at Best Buy, down from $1,400.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DUmO9L"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uPH49gJM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 70-inch TU6985 LED TV&lt;/a&gt; that’s all about size and cost-effectiveness is $600 at Best Buy, down from $750.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWWElf"&gt;Sony deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CFELaP"&gt;The 65-inch Bravia XR X90J with full-array local dimming for better contrast costs $1,200 at Best Buy, down from $1,500. If all you need is a 50-inch TV, this same model is available in that size for $900 from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uXT44hQ9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X90J-Inch-Compatibility-XR50X90J/dp/B08TLC4C4T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1slr8"&gt;If you want an OLED, Sony’s Bravia XR A80J with a 65-inch OLED panel costs $1,800 instead of its original $2,300 cost at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uW7MVOb8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-A80J-Inch-Compatibility-XR65A80J/dp/B08TKR3WLJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IPisjL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10831129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ODiTbB"&gt;A much smaller OLED from Sony is discounted at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uYGj86Hp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 48-inch Bravia A9S&lt;/a&gt; is available for $1,200, down $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gzfyQQ"&gt;LG deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WoVMMm"&gt;The most affordable OLED TV from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u0CKA2Rz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG is its A1&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available in its 48-inch size for just $900 (usually $1,200). This model has a 60Hz refresh rate, and it lacks HDMI 2.1 ports, unlike LG’s pricier 2021 OLED TVs, but it can still deliver stellar picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mjEyBM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YTId2z"&gt;If you don’t want to compromise on any features, LG’s C1 OLED might be the right fit for you. The 48-inch model is $1,100 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u22rW6q4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED48C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFK81RH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down $200 from its usual price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JyDucB"&gt;For something that’s far less costly, LG’s 50-inch NanoCell 75 series model costs just $500 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u35pqIuB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-75NANO75UPA-Alexa-Built-NanoCell/dp/B08WHW3VX1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small $70 discount from what it previously sold for. Usually, jumping up to a massive 70-inch TV is an egregious jump in price, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vphRZMsd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this model is available in its 70-inch size for just $750&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LBJXAT"&gt;LG also makes a NanoCell 90 series TV that has full-array dimming zones for improved fidelity in low-lit or high contrast scenes. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u87RD6b5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can get a 55-inch version&lt;/a&gt; for $900 at Best Buy, down from its original $1,100 price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="26F66P"&gt;Insignia deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8b6eCx"&gt;Insignia’s televisions cost significantly less than any of the brands above. While they likely can’t win in a head-to-head competition for panel and backlighting quality against many other LED TVs, at least they compete in terms of functionality. Each of them has Amazon’s Fire TV software built-in, so you don’t need to buy extra streaming hardware (most models come with some form of this feature, whether it’s Android TV, Google TV, Roku, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="abkwsj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vauWNY9G" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch F30 LED TV&lt;/a&gt; costs just $300 at Best Buy and Amazon, well below its original $550 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bClIqR"&gt;For a step up in visual quality (particularly its contrast) thanks to quantum dot technology, the Insignia F50 55-inch TV costs $400 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ve1q77bV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-55-inch-4K-Fire-TV/dp/B08X7JBQ6F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This model usually costs $650 outside of a sale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jq9k3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797476"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="smFTIN"&gt;Insignia makes several sizes of each of its TVs, and you’re guaranteed to find a low price on all of them, so pick the one that works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FSv7hk"&gt;Vizio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KkdJyK"&gt;Vizio’s mid-range &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vWptw98X" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M7 QLED 4K TV with a 50-inch screen&lt;/a&gt; starts at the low price of $500 (usually $700) at Best Buy. This model has a 60Hz refresh rate, but its full-array local dimming is an impressive feature at this price point. If you want a bigger version of the M7, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vXZiAhCw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 70-inch model is just $750&lt;/a&gt; (usually $1,100) at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g19Rkk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDnJ6m"&gt;The best TV that Vizio makes that isn’t an OLED is its P-series Quantum. You can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vY9ks5Wm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch PQ9 for $1,000&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off) at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uqhrQ"&gt;Now, for Vizio’s debut OLED (a Best Buy-exclusive model), the discounts actually aren’t great so far. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3wjdxwkiv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 55-inch model is $1,000&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off), while the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3whqAM5hi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch version is $1,500&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off). These aren’t the best-ever prices; they’re off by a couple hundred dollars, actually. Feature-wise, they’re competitive with LG’s C1, though some people report that this model’s software is one of its weakest attributes. If you can look past some of those issues, though, it might be worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BKzbvy"&gt;TCL deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WFLXcV"&gt;TCL’s TVs are known best for their Roku integration, but the company more recently started to produce models that run on Android TV or Google TV. It’s a vastly different interface from Roku’s, and it’ll ship with a different kind of remote control, but many of the same features are there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xdbdf"&gt;But that’s not all the decision comes down to. Sometimes, specs will be different, making one model better than the other. The way that TCL names its TVs indicates its quality, more or less. Its 6-series is among the best (and most costly) it offers, while anything lower than that will be a slight step down in features and specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oYaAFX"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vkS85LOI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s 55-inch 4-series TV with Android TV&lt;/a&gt; software costs $380 at Best Buy, down from $450. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrjlTa3N" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;If you want that exact TV in the Roku flavor&lt;/a&gt;, it’s $20 cheaper at Best Buy, costing $360.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KwCAX6"&gt;Stepping up in quality, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vwvQCzGU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s 5-series 4K TV with Roku software&lt;/a&gt; and a 50-inch QLED panel costs $450 at Best Buy (down from $600). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vwPpTZpp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL makes an identical version with Google TV software&lt;/a&gt; for the same $450 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="AyViM1"&gt;Finally, TCL’s high-end 6-series TV is seeing some great discounts, too. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vxAVRNIJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 55-inch model with Roku software&lt;/a&gt;, Mini LED backlighting, and a QLED panel costs $700 instead of $950 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HhDMLc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k2pC5S"&gt;You can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885N17CC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model of the 6-series with Roku software&lt;/a&gt; for $898, down from $1,500 at Amazon. For an even bigger &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vziiO37l" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch version of the 6-series TV,&lt;/a&gt; but with Google TV software, Best Buy has you set for $1,300 ($1,000 off its original price).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D51R4e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Netflix hub includes some exclusive audio extras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bL1FsAi6DV2MWaserk2SBJT158k=/52x0:1996x1296/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182323/netflix_spotify_music.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4m1ZiY"&gt;Spotify has introduced a new hub that’s home to all the music from Netflix’s shows and movies. A &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-23/get-even-more-squid-game-bridgerton-and-money-heist-with-our-new-netflix-collaboration-and-dedicated-hub/"&gt;post on Spotify’s newsroom&lt;/a&gt; explains that both free and premium users can access the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/netflix"&gt;Netflix hub&lt;/a&gt; by searching for “Netflix” on Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBKkHD"&gt;There, you’ll find official playlists from Netflix TV shows like &lt;em&gt;La Casa de Papel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;On My Block&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, along with the official soundtracks from &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bruised&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, and more. It also includes some of Netflix’s official podcasts, such as &lt;em&gt;Okay, Now Listen, Netflix Is a Daily Joke&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; 10/10 (Would Recommend)&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Crown: The Official Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, all of which you can access from this single location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xhO3Sy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify has rolled out an “enhanced album experience” for Netflix’s The Harder They Fall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="912kYy"&gt;Spotify has also rolled out an “&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6IgPnyVYfHg"&gt;enhanced album experience&lt;/a&gt;” for the streaming platform’s new film, &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;. This gives you access to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie’s soundtrack, which includes songs from Jay-Z, Kid Cudi, Koffee, and Ms. Lauryn Hill. Aside from all that, Spotify has added new content to &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/netflix_lcdp"&gt;its &lt;em&gt;La Casa De Papel&lt;/em&gt; page&lt;/a&gt; (which doesn’t seem to be working at the moment) and is even offering &lt;a href="https://www.lacasadepapel.withspotify.com/"&gt;a quiz&lt;/a&gt; that’s supposed to match your personality with a La Banda character from the show and an accompanying soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMkrVi"&gt;Netflix isn’t the first entertainment giant that Spotify has collaborated with. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20696982/spotify-disney-hub-animated-film-live-action-pixar-marvel-star-wars-lion-king-frozen"&gt;In 2019, Spotify launched&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/disney-page"&gt;Disney hub&lt;/a&gt;, which contains official Disney playlists, soundtracks, and Disney-themed podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox’s 20th Anniversary museum is a metaverse full of achievements and mistakes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ym7dgY5OzpyQTG7diS5F-0dEGTU=/133x0:1863x1153/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182280/HGWv24g.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3opEas"&gt;Microsoft has created an &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/"&gt;Xbox metaverse museum&lt;/a&gt; where you can roam around and discover the history of Xbox consoles. It’s designed to celebrate 20 years of Xbox and includes some infamous mistakes like the &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/en/content/xbox-360-screen-8"&gt;Xbox 360 red ring of death&lt;/a&gt; or Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/en/content/original-xbox-screen-5"&gt;attempt to acquire Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; in spring 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehF08a"&gt;As you roam around this &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/"&gt;Xbox museum&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see fellow Xbox players interacting with the digital exhibits and charting the progress of the original Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and the latest Xbox Series X / S consoles. Each moment in the 20-year timeline has an associated story, usually with a video documenting the milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ztQyPUXL_H0e3u5n_EB3HQhv7Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037211/xboxmuseum.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox museum is a metaverse full of achievements and failures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sWYYiV"&gt;There’s even a personal Xbox museum, so if you’ve ever owned an Xbox console, you can look back at what games you played first on certain consoles, the number of games you’ve played, and even when you first signed into Xbox Live. For some reason, &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first games I played on Xbox 360, and I apparently first signed into Xbox Live 18 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUKgWY"&gt;You can explore a total of 132 moments in Xbox history throughout the metaverse museum and navigate around using WASD on a keyboard. Each moment has its own link, and you can even share your own anniversary museum section with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vEIjF9i4Ypr6eytjox7ORSEutwY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037193/dpoiSkY.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a personalized museum for each Xbox player.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aLMnz"&gt;For years, Capcom’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; franchise has been split in half. There’s the game and animated film series built closely around Shinji Mikami’s 1996 survival horror game. Then there’s the live-action series, a half-dozen barely related blockbusters starring Milla Jovovich. But the newly released &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; aims to change that. It’s a jump-scare-filled live-action adaptation of the earliest &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; games, and it plays out like a 107-minute fan film — which isn’t entirely a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DruWsl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following includes mild narrative and thematic spoilers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrkB09"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt;, written and directed by Johannes Roberts, merges the plots and characters of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt;. In the year 1998, the grim post-industrial town of Raccoon City has just lost its biggest employer, the Umbrella Corporation. To make things worse, college student Claire Redfield (Kaya Scodelario) believes Umbrella has polluted the town’s water with a mysterious and dangerous substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wEsSug"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City feels built to be dissected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82Vr8C"&gt;Claire’s elite police operative brother, Chris Redfield (Robbie Amell), initially doesn’t believe her. Then Chris, his trigger-happy partner Jill Valentine (Hannah John-Kamen), and hunky blond heartthrob Albert Wesker (Tom Hopper) are called to investigate a killing in a &lt;a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion"&gt;deserted mansion&lt;/a&gt;. Raccoon City’s population turns into flesh-eating zombies. Claire must team up with rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy (Avan Jogia) to escape. Along the way, she starts to unravel another mystery that’s bothered her for years: a grotesque creature that tried to befriend her as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9pcstm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4q6UGCyHZCI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dJX8hB"&gt;Roberts, who previously directed aquatic horror movie &lt;em&gt;47 Meters Down&lt;/em&gt;, has &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-director-johannes-roberts-interview-movie-adaptation-games/"&gt;described his project&lt;/a&gt; as a “pure” adaptation compared to previous films. And &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City &lt;/em&gt;seems built to be dissected by fans. Its intertextual references will probably fill countless online Easter egg guides. I’m not a big enough &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; completionist to fill those guides, but I got the palpable sense of watching something where the creators were showing their homework to gain viewers’ trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUzUVQ"&gt;There’s a specific joy in watching scenes you love from other media get played out by real people in a movie, and Roberts has a good sense of what makes individual moments of translation satisfying. The filmmakers compose shots to evoke elements from the games even when the narrative context is different. They aren’t beholden to casting actors who look exactly like their in-game counterparts, but they hold onto details like Claire Redfield’s iconic red jacket. The script buys wholeheartedly into &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil’s&lt;/em&gt; weird narrative quirks, like Raccoon City’s &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-22-how-resident-evil-2s-map-uses-familiarity-against-you"&gt;implausibly ornate police station&lt;/a&gt;, rather than trying to rationalize them or lampshade them with a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QA8Iym"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does any evil corporation really need this many hidden tunnels?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FDT1NN"&gt;The tradeoff is that &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; feels almost surreal through any other lens. If you’re not on board with &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil’s&lt;/em&gt; mythos, you may find yourself wondering things like: “Why does a pharmaceutical corporation have a quasi-military strike force capable of containing an entire small town?” or “How does this small town have enough orphans to fill a school-sized building?” or “Did the corporation &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to dig a secret tunnel network that is accessed with playing-card-themed keys, and how long are those tunnels, anyway?” If you asked me to draw a map of Raccoon City after watching this movie, it would look like a tesseract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcjPlb"&gt;The feeling is compounded by the cast’s incredibly calm performances. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; is a gory mess of dismemberment, accidental self-immolation, and ravening zombie mobs, and its survivors seem moderately irritated by these developments at best.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Leon Kennedy, in particular, is played less like a fresh-faced cop out of his depth and more like a character from Jim Jarmusch’s deadpan satire &lt;em&gt;The Dead Don’t Die&lt;/em&gt; or possibly an exasperated mailroom intern perpetually on the verge of stapling his own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="M0xI07"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The film glosses over a lot of very weird source material&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0c87R8"&gt;The issue isn’t that &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; is unrealistic or that I couldn’t pore over a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; wiki to answer the questions above, but that the oddities never pay off. Things like Leon’s casual ineptitude could be effective comedy, but other characters stay similarly nonchalant through events the narrative suggests should devastate them. And instead of leaning into video game set pieces that look absolutely bizarre in a live-action film, the film glosses over them in favor of more generic action scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkNuH0"&gt;Despite this, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; goes a long way by gleefully embracing primal creepiness. Its first 20 minutes push every available button to freak viewers out: eerie dolls, rasping voices from the shadows, scrawled warnings from strange creatures, cheerful children’s drawings with ominous undertones, and much more. It evolves quickly into an action-horror narrative after this, but it still draws on the strength of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil’s&lt;/em&gt; spooky aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrPCpl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; gets a lot of moment-to-moment elements right. It’s a film that’s straight-faced without being pretentious, full of over-the-top genre tropes without falling into grating, campy self-awareness. But it’s sunk so deep in a decades-old fictional world that it can’t look beyond its boundaries. The film delivers a checklist to remind viewers why they like &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil —&lt;/em&gt; but it sometimes seems to forget what’s actually on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmmspA"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; will premiere in theaters November 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wireless earbuds make a great holiday gift for others or yourself.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLBEwG"&gt;One of the most sought-after gifts every holiday — at least, ever since Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone — has been true wireless earbuds. They are often the favored listening device of many people because they offer the most convenience, and they’re a product category that frequently goes on sale. Full-size headphones offer superior sound, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;those have their fair share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday discounts&lt;/a&gt; to be had, but most casual listeners often prefer earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2rBqw"&gt;Here, we have rounded up all the best early Black Friday deals we can find on wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Jabra, Beats, and even Google, as well as a couple of lesser-known brands. Each has its own unique qualities or value proposition to offer, and we have deals spanning the range that can fit into any budget — starting with premium models and extending all the way to entry-level options still worth your listening time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sukfZy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="2ugPuK"&gt;The best deals on premium earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ev2IcG"&gt;The Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds have been &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;pick for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;the best overall earbuds&lt;/a&gt; since they took the market by storm over the summer. These earbuds are currently on sale for $248, as opposed to their list price of $280, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3rGTOkfpF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsony-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-wf-1000xm4%2F-%2FA-83706422%3Fpreselect%3D82691015%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Leading-Noise-Canceling-Truly-Wireless-Earbuds-Black%2F846848972&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1645715-REG%2Fsony_wf1000xm4_b_wireless_noise_canceling.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792011%2Fblack-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="JDX844"&gt;Jabra’s Elite 85t offer noise cancellation and the ability to connect to multiple devices, all for the very competitive price of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, discounted from their usual $230. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

These buds trade noise cancellation for better IPX4 sweat and weather resistance, with blue and white options for sporty colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aEHu7v"&gt;The latest revision of Apple’s hugely popular AirPods Pro now comes with a MagSafe-compatible charging case, and you can currently get it for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$159 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to its normal full price of $249 (saving you $90). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3urgh0XZ0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-84852592%3Fpreselect%3D77603773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also have it marked down but only to $190. The AirPods Pro are always a hot seller during Black Friday and Cyber Monday times, so we might see more movement here with other retailers joining the competitive fray. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="u5G8Uj"&gt;Samsung’s top-line Galaxy Buds Pro are a strong alternative to some of Apple’s best and, most likely, your ideal solution if you prefer Galaxy phones.

&lt;h2 id="toUvFv"&gt;The best deals on midrange earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yBZHUa"&gt;The second-gen Apple AirPods with a wired charging case are practically the de facto standard in the world of wireless earbuds. They don’t have active noise-canceling, but the hard plastic design allows a one-size-fits-many approach, and the connectivity to Apple devices is easy as pie. They’re on sale for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $50.

&lt;li id="knniBz"&gt;If you prefer your base-model AirPods to come with the optional wireless charging case, the outright best price right now is $133 at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeDeals112321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;.

Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021%3Fathbdg%3DL1600&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has them for $150 and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1469201-REG%2Fapple_mrxj2am_a_airpods_with_wireless_charging.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792011%2Fblack-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $174.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="peFXtu"&gt;The newest earbuds from Apple, the third-gen AirPods, borrow some styling from the AirPods Pro and improve on the second-gen while adding a MagSafe case. So far, we have seen them temporarily drop to $155 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; but quickly sell out.

&lt;li id="ff9S6b"&gt;The bean-like Galaxy Buds Live have a unique design that is very low-key when you’re wearing them out, and the sound quality is great for something so compact — even if the noise-canceling isn’t the best. They can be had for just $100 (a whole $70 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vqvHMw9T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-live%2F-%2FA-81111923%3Fpreselect%3D80785948%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Live-Mystic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F369534088&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1577731-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r180nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_live_noise_canceling.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792011%2Fblack-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="O7U3xo"&gt;The recently launched OnePlus Buds Pro are affordable earbuds that nail a lot of the basics for a great price. They’re currently just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Wireless-Charging-Cancellation-E503A/dp/B07XWK1DYB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$120 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off the full price of $150. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNJlmz"&gt;If you need your earbuds to scream “gamer!” then look no further than the RGB- and ANC-infused Razer Hammerhead true wireless earbuds. They’re down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Hammerhead-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds/dp/B099LZ2BGB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $30. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632338/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-2nd-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dMLX2A"&gt;The best deals on entry-level earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xnjFFz"&gt;Samsung’s sequel to its original Galaxy Buds, the Galaxy Buds Plus, offer improved sound quality, and they’re not just $79 for Black Friday at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-improved-Charging-included/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922%3Fathbdg%3DL1300&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bU3yW4"&gt;The Google Pixel Buds A-series are a lower-cost option of the Pixel Buds that finally started to get wireless earbuds right for Google, and being cheaper helps this model to be even more appealing. It’s a solid earbud for any Android user, but maybe most desirable if you’re a Pixel phone owner. You can pick them up for just $79 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vBW7Etnr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Pixel-Buds-A-Series-Truly-Wireless-Earbuds-Audio-Headphones-with-Bluetooth-White%2F620970985&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1635922-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02213_us_pixel_buds_a_series_true.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792011%2Fblack-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWqOnU"&gt;The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 are not going to win any notable awards in any particular categories, but they’re fine for a basic set of earbuds from a reputable brand that just cost &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Bluetooth-Earphones-Personalized-Cancelling/dp/B07SKJNCXM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45 ($5 off) at&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for Black Friday. They even have wireless charging and solid battery life. Think of it as stepping into stocking stuffer territory, but you’re not buying the equivalent of a true wireless lump of coal.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>What not to do when your podcast app gets acquired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1TZbaLf2gIz6tK087Q6DrxTTQ6Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182144/acast_radiopublic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QkhRTr"&gt;Hello, hello. Welcome back to Tuesday; I hope everyone has found ways to keep “working” ahead of the holiday and isn’t daydreaming too much about the hoards of food we here in the US will be eating in just a couple days. Today’s issue is a hodgepodge of things — a nice mix. Today, we’re talking about what happens when a podcast app gets acquired, ExxonMobil “duping” &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw3PKd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Acast acquired RadioPublic in February; now podcasters say the company has gone dark on them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbAoZc"&gt;In February, Acast, the Europe-based hosting and monetization company, acquired RadioPublic, a podcast player and company known for its creator-centric technology. The acquisition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22289742/acast-radiopublic-podcasting-platform-acquisition"&gt;was billed to me&lt;/a&gt; as a way for Acast to take over the podcast space and become big in the US. Notably, Matt MacDonald, co-founder and chief product officer of RadioPublic, told me at the time: “We have no intention of spinning [the RadioPublic] app down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lVmgr"&gt;But now, nine months after the purchase, podcasters say the app is borked and not updating. New episodes aren’t regularly uploaded on certain show pages; some podcasters can’t publicly list new shows; and, beyond that, many say they can’t get in touch with the company despite reaching out through a dedicated support email and social media. The issue appears to have been going on for months. Lots of people have tweeted to the company, but I’ll include a couple screenshots below so you can get an idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hueki7"&gt;One podcaster, Klaudia Amenábar, who hosts the queer &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; podcast &lt;a href="https://rupalps-podrace-a-queer-star-wars-podcast.simplecast.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RuPalp’s Podrace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells me she ran into issues when trying to distribute the show on RadioPublic. Although her RSS feed worked fine on all other listening apps, whenever she tried to make it publicly available on RadioPublic, she received an error message. This went on, she says, for months and still isn’t fixed. MacDonald emailed her directly, once she tweeted at Acast’s account, and told her the team was “unable to help individual podcasts diagnose a specific error,” according to a screenshot viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. She later tried to also distribute a second show with a separate RSS feed and received the same error. Her hosting provider, Simplecast, troubleshot her RSS feed to ensure nothing strange was going on, she says, and, “at the end, they were like, ‘That’s really weird, it must be a RadioPublic problem.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hYv09"&gt;I reached out to Acast for comment and got this: “We’re aware of an issue that currently appears to affect a small number of feeds on the RadioPublic platform, impacting the submission and display of new content. We understand this is frustrating for the creators affected and for fans trying to access new content from the affected feeds. Our team is investigating the cause and is working to get this resolved as soon as possible. We will share an update with the community once we have more information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaF849"&gt;Now, RadioPublic isn’t a top app or even remotely essential to podcasters’ distribution strategy. (Dave Zohrob, CEO at Chartable, tells me over the past 30 days, it accounted for less than 0.1 percent of listens, as did Justin Jackson, co-founder of Transistor.fm, from March data, which, yeah, not great, but also not helped by the fact that at least some shows can’t get their episodes to update.) But the reason I bring this story up is because of the many acquisitions we’ve seen in this space and to use this as an example of how not to handle it, particularly if you interface with podcasters directly. Don’t leave them in the lurch. Another podcaster I spoke with, David Cameo, the founder and host of &lt;a href="https://squawkingdead.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squawking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; podcast, tells me he had embedded the RadioPublic player on his website for four years until the company went silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qB1Ra"&gt;“I just gave up on them. Had to. Nobody cares.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8ofTV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s ExxonMobil ad and the struggle to get podcast ads right&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57n99Q"&gt;A conversation is brewing around how oil companies are using podcast ads to advance their messaging and brand. Emily Atkin over at the &lt;em&gt;Heated&lt;/em&gt; newsletter &lt;a href="https://heated.world/p/how-exxon-duped-the-daily"&gt;wrote last week&lt;/a&gt; about an ExxonMobil ad that ran in &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;that she says is misleading. (Check out Atkin’s post for the specifics of the ad and her proposed edits.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hky43d"&gt;She writes that the ad “appeared to violate &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;’s policy against fossil fuel sponsorships.” However, a&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson told her: “We do not allow oil and gas companies to sponsor &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;wholesale,” but “[any] company can place spot advertising within &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;podcast, as long as it meets our advertising acceptability guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7d7OJ"&gt;Also worth adding to the story here is &lt;em&gt;Drilled&lt;/em&gt; podcast host Amy Westervelt’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amywestervelt/status/1458841818313859077?s=20"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on other oil companies and oil-reliant brands utilizing podcast ads. One person notes Politico’s&lt;em&gt; Energy &lt;/em&gt;podcast is sponsored by Chevron, which indeed appears to be true, just as another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vc3bF3"&gt;Still, this line between sponsorships and spot advertising is definitely an odd one for the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; to draw, and I won’t pretend to understand it. But I did reach out to a few folks on the ad side of things to figure out how the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ fact-checking process usually goes and whether this ad rang alarm bells for them. One ad buyer told me they’ve had the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; push back on ad copy and request data or research to support what’s being said. They also said claims aren’t allowed to be made; neither are endorsements. Others didn’t seem shocked by what was being said in this particular ad. One person equated Exxon’s “clever wording” to how tech companies often market their products — hyping a new feature — but doubted the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ listeners would be duped into thinking Exxon has nothing to do with oil so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="I9cbiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="27NcqO"&gt;Broadly, I imagine this is only the start of broader pushback on misleading ads, as well as strange brand / content pair-ups, both from the public and podcast hosts. This might happen for a few reasons: 1.) As more indie shows go corporate, they cede control over their advertisers to bigger and hungrier sales teams. 2.) As more money enters the space, of which I will have much more to say in the coming weeks, larger advertisers are flooding in, often those who run more controversial businesses. 3.) Dynamic Ad Insertion becoming more popular means more shows are allowing ad marketplaces to automatically insert ads based on audience targeting. This might yield undesired pairings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7m2lp"&gt;All of which is to say, I’m keeping a close eye on how this nets out. We’ve come to expect some bizarre display ads to show up alongside the articles we read online. We probably even feel the same way about radio ads. Will that expectation of shitty ads come to podcasts, too? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ie1SUO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confused podcast listeners helpfully review bomb Apple Podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ELxwI"&gt;You might recall people pointing out months ago that Apple Podcasts maintained an abysmally low app rating. People hate it, I guess. So imagine the shock and awe when positive reviews started pouring in, raising its rating from 1.8 stars to 4.6. The catch, however, is that these reviews all extoll various podcasts, not the app itself. My colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791968/apple-podcasts-star-score-review-prompt"&gt;has the full story&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple confirmed that it’s relying on a new review prompt. “With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review just like most third-party apps — using the standard Rating &amp;amp; Review prompt available to all developers,” said an Apple spokesperson. People are just confused about what they’re supposed to be reviewing. The power of an in-app push!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkAZk8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook is paying people up to $50K to get them to use its live audio feature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUuUro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-hands-out-cash-to-creators-to-boost-clubhouse-rival"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (from behind a paywall) that Facebook is resorting to cash to get creators to use its Live Audio Rooms feature. Per the piece: “Facebook is offering to pay musicians and other creators $10,000 to $50,000 per session on its five-month-old live audio product, plus a fee for guests of $10,000 or more,” according to “people with direct knowledge of deal terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYInXm"&gt;At that price, hosts have to put together four to six live programs lasting at least 30 minutes each. I will be shocked if anyone tunes into these rooms, honestly, but I can’t fault people for wanting to get the $$$. However, what I don’t fully understand about these tech companies spending millions to get people to try their new feature is whether any of these users will actually stick around when the cash runs out. An open question at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnbfrL"&gt;Now, finally, one for the Goners in the room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez5UUo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Long Gone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;podcast is releasing an album of music commentary?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4mgPZ"&gt;I hate to admit that I’ve become a Goner, but it happened. For our purposes, though, &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone&lt;/em&gt;, an interview and culture show co-hosted by Chris Black and Jason Stewart, signed to record label Jagjaguwar to release &lt;a href="https://www.secretlystore.com/how-long-gone"&gt;an album&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donetodeath/status/1461705143909552129?s=20"&gt;now has&lt;/a&gt; a tracklist and details. Coming out December 17th, apparently the duo recorded an 80-minute commentary about music from various Jagjaguwar artists. Two CDs for $13.99. Props for the creative monetization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8maThR"&gt;Okay, that’s it. A long one, but I have to make up for future lost time. I’ll catch you all next Tuesday. Ta-ta.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals under $25</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InnS7S5uPiCAjrbGIvGg1i-jofo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181956/dseifert_181011_3006_1141.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the best affordable smart speakers you can get is just $20 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ld9a3y"&gt;If our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;best early Black Friday deals under $50&lt;/a&gt; was outside your budget, don’t worry: there’s also plenty you can buy for under $25. Several retailers are now heavily discounting popular tech products in the short lead-up to Black Friday, discounting everything from Bluetooth trackers and smart speakers to the latest gaming subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Va5kw"&gt;For your convenience, we’ve curated a list of some of the best sub-$25 options below. If you’re looking for more holiday gift ideas that won’t break the bank, however, we’ve also put together separate budget-based gift guides for items under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745314/holiday-gift-guide-under-25-cheap-tech-2021-best-ideas"&gt;$25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UG2Xy7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;For iPhone owners planning on traveling this holiday season, Amazon’s offering a great deal on Apple’s official AirTag Loop. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own, you’ll need such a loop to securely attach them to luggage, keys, and other items. Unfortunately, these loops can be as expensive as the AirTags themselves. Thankfully, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-Loop-Deep-Navy/dp/B0932LZM6K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting the loop made to carry Apple’s popular Bluetooth tracker, selling it an all-time low of around $20 instead of $29. This deal is valid on the deep navy colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XnECMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOcQkL"&gt;Like Apple’s AirTag, Samsung Galaxy SmartTag Plus locates lost items ranging from keys to pets. Even though it can work with both iOS and Android devices, we recommend it more for Samsung users as it’s designed to work best with Samsung Galaxy devices. The convenient Bluetooth tracker features an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio so you can more accurately track items and use the AR mode to see exactly where your missing tag is. To use the UWB radio, though, you’ll need a compatible UWB-equipped Galaxy phone. The tracker can also be used as a remote control for Samsung smart home stuff. It’s a great buy for those embedded within the Samsung ecosystem, especially right now, as the tracker is going for $25 instead of $40 today at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartTag-Bluetooth-Tracker-Locator/dp/B08NRNSVRK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/client_redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-a-smart-tag-1-pack-black-ei-t7300bbegus%2F%3Fnrtv_cid%3D.nrtv_plchldr.%26cid%3Dopmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mobacc-042720-142010-verge-8259575%26utm_source%3Dverge%26utm_medium%3Dnarrativ%26utm_campaign%3D8259575%26utm_content%3Dmobacc%26nrtv_as_src%3D1&amp;amp;a=1745743455626377571&amp;amp;uuid=b35751ff-a0af-4e83-9776-063d4c38d134&amp;amp;uid_bam=1750571413629784227&amp;amp;ar=1758359825979119625" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PULPjx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPzUR"&gt;For Xbox owners, we found a phenomenal deal from &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital/-/A-76626995&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560195%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pass for $25 instead of its usual $45 — which is nearly 50 percent off. This pass gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. It also offers access to more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;launches next month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cBwzN1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k5hzbg"&gt;It may be an older model, but the third-generation Echo Dot is still a great device that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;we once called&lt;/a&gt; the best cheap smart speaker you can buy. It’s far superior to its predecessor, with a loud and rich sound we praised. Right now, you can pick one up with a free Sengled smart bulb from Amazon for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Bluetooth/dp/B08YT3BWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $35 on an otherwise $55 bundle. If you don’t want the color bulb, you can also opt for six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7nnaNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLMzzl"&gt;For those who prefer Google smart speakers, the Google Nest Mini is currently 50 percent off at multiple retailers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called the small smart speaker a great upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini, one that sounds far better. The Nest Mini also makes it easy to add Google Assistant to your home. It lacks the Echo Dot’s 3.5mm jack that allows for a wired connection, but, unlike Amazon’s device, you can hang it on your wall without extra accessories. Right now, you can pick one up in various colors for 50 percent off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-US"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Charcoal/741412707?athbdg=L1300&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LKg5XqS2?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fblack-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-mini-2nd-generation/-/A-78589456?preselect=76500134#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are all selling the speaker for $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="opekZV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="7cYUPB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDsK5U"&gt;Streaming sticks are also heavily discounted right now, especially over on Amazon. At the moment, Amazon is even taking 50 percent off of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVYZ1Y5?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=124&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbea42d-e732-8263-21f&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553294%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with the third-gen Alexa remote. Typically $50, you can pick one up right now for $25, the device’s best price to date. It may not be as capable as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; (which is currently selling for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=94&amp;amp;imprToken=1abea435-1abd-7fcc-e1c&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22548186%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35&lt;/a&gt; instead of $55), but it’s still plenty fast and supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10 Plus, and HDR10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Obk1C9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5Bg1h"&gt;Those curious about Google’s Stadia game streaming service may want to check out this Stadia Premiere Edition bundle discount, which is available for more than 70 percent off. The $80 bundle comes with a white Stadia controller, as well as a 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for just $22&lt;/a&gt;, which equates to around $58 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SqIGMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880420"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="xJLatZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Stadia is celebrating its second birthday with hardware for free or cheap","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XXTH4I"&gt;The Blink Mini is a small, wired home security camera that comes with night vision and is capable of recording in 1080p while supporting two-way audio. While we weren’t blown away by the camera, we found that it still offers good video and audio quality for its price. Typically $35, you can buy the already affordable camera for $20 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Note, however, those new to Blink’s ecosystem will have to pay an additional $3 per camera each month for cloud storage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21231112/blink-mini-smart-home-camera-security-cam-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great bargain on smart cameras, robot vacuums, and even a smart mop. Here’s our roundup of the best deals on smart home gear you can buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQmoq2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more Black Friday deals? Be sure to check out our continuously updated roundup of all the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best early Black Friday sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero’s mesh Wi-Fi products are 40 percent off right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lKgkN0"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KckJmY"&gt;The foundation of any smart home is good Wi-Fi, and if you’re looking to start out or are having trouble with connections in your home, a mesh Wi-Fi router is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fos0TC"&gt;Eero Pro 6 is offering up to 40 percent off its excellent mesh Wi-Fi routers that have Thread radios built-in (and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero has said will get upgraded to the new smart home standard Matter&lt;/a&gt;, when it arrives next year). The Eero Pro 6 two pack is selling for $299, a savings of $100, and the Eero 6 two pack is down to $167 from $279, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://eero.com/sale?utm_source=eero+Home+WiFi+System&amp;amp;utm_campaign=454108a917-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_11_19_04_22&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_22bdbdc347-454108a917-162523809&amp;amp;mc_cid=454108a917&amp;amp;mc_eid=3e134bd98f"&gt;Eero&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Read our Eero review.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Iowp5C"&gt;Google has discounted its Nest Wifi mesh networking system this week.

The Ring Wired uses existing doorbell wiring and works over 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alHazy"&gt;For a battery-powered option, the new Blink video doorbell is just $34.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $10, and it can also be wired if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Ijz8w"&gt;The tiny Blink Mini camera is selling for an even tinier price. Just $20 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=Blink+Mini+camera&amp;amp;qid=1637362943&amp;amp;s=hi&amp;amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTlU1UkdWSDlQNEVUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTU2MzUzMjBZTkhCTDhBUEtVUiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTcwOTU3MjdGVkVTRzBNVTc0QiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, down from $34.99, this is the cheapest indoor smart security camera you can buy right now.&lt;/li&gt;

You’ll want to make sure you can mount this on the side of your house first, as it has a rather awkward under-the-eave install. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of this floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="PyzsDl"&gt;Abode’s great little Abode Cam 2, an indoor / outdoor camera that works with or without an Abode system, is $24.95 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abode.&lt;/a&gt; If you want to add a security system, too, Abode has an excellent bundle exclusively &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website for $299&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $300.

&lt;li id="9F8lFk"&gt;Another smart security deal is the Ecobee SmartCamera with voice control for $69.99 (regularly $99.99). This versatile indoor camera works with Alexa, Google, and HomeKit.

&lt;h2 id="Ncjqi1"&gt;Smart locks and robot vacuum deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="JEwGgK"&gt;If you’re looking to upgrade your door lock, the Level Lock is a very good, usually very pricey solution. The Level Lock Touch Edition is currently on sale for $246.80, a savings of $80, which allows touch-to-open, access with a key card, as well as app, voice, and regular key control.

    <title>PS5, Xbox Series X, and GPU street prices are still through the roof</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tS1sPlo1_eqnKzuNGHomJn_Xaso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181673/shollister_201117_4303_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 and $579 AMD Radeon RX 6800 are still selling well above MSRP.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KzoG02"&gt;Sony, Microsoft, Nvidia and AMD say they’re doing everything in their power to put a console or graphics card in your hands. But judging by eBay resale prices, their best won’t be nearly good enough this holiday season. One year after the next generation of gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430284/microsoft-sony-xbox-series-ps5-nvidia-rtx-3080-next-gen-gaming"&gt;was supposed to arrive&lt;/a&gt; (narrator: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;it did not&lt;/a&gt;) people are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; forking out hundreds of dollars over MSRP for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, and and they’re often still paying &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; what a new PC graphics card was originally supposed to cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpa6YI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;Remember March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when I told you how the two graphics cards in the photo above were worth a combined $2,570 on the open market? That was a shocking leap compared to the $1,660 total they could fetch in December 2020, already well above their $1,078 MSRP. But eight months later, that same photo now contains $2,605 worth of GPUs on the secondhand market. They haven’t dipped one bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhRcke"&gt;The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, too, are fetching higher prices this week than they did in March 2020 — if you take the scalper route, you can expect to pay over $800 on average for what should have been a $500 game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH7OBR"&gt;Those are the key findings from our latest dive into eBay sales data, but here’s the whole set for you to scan yourself. It includes the latest street prices for every console and graphics card released this generation, after filtering out a number of fakes, bundles, freak outliers (one AMD RX 6800 allegedly sold for $8,260) and other eBay listings that muddied the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VGnQKj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10882070"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hrLEwD"&gt;As you can see from the chart, a PS5 is no longer worth $1,000 like it was back in December 2020, but the discless PS5 Digital Edition can still fetch twice its asking price on eBay, and even the Xbox Series X appears to be slightly more desirable than before. The one bright spot is the less expensive Xbox Series S, which has finally come down to a mere $50 or so over its original list price of $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wt02nF"&gt;There are a few surprising findings on the GPU side of things, like how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; is currently fetching more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;3070 Ti&lt;/a&gt;, despite being a little less powerful for games. (Perhaps people prefer the 3070’s reduced power consumption, smaller frame, and — in some cases — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;lack of cryptocurrency mining nerfs&lt;/a&gt;.) It’s also remarkable how much less the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt; fetches now, despite being fairly close to a 3070 in performance and well regarded for both gaming and mining from what I’ve heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCvngA"&gt;Then again, the 3060 Ti Founders Edition is in greater demand than ever — the $400 card is now pulling down $1,447 on average, though I didn’t break it out in the chart. It’s one of the best picks out there for smaller cases, so I’m not wholly surprised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc8sFy"&gt;Raw street prices don’t tell the whole story, though. Like in March, I also compiled a chart of &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; consoles and components changed hands on eBay this past week, and it’s intriguing: Less than half as many Sony PS5s are moving, but now almost twice as many Nvidia graphics cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3jkLbe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10882103"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzcmm6"&gt;Lower secondhand sales numbers for consoles don’t necessarily mean weaker supply — in fact, it could easily mean the opposite. Perhaps more people are getting satisfaction outside of eBay, never needing a scalper, because the likes of Sony and Microsoft are letting more people buy those consoles at retail instead. But on the GPU side of things, we can also still see how precious few AMD graphics cards are changing hands compared to Nvidia, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;original excellent Radeon RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; barely a blip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV9Q5b"&gt;Unfortunately, there's no end in sight for the great GPU shortage, so you shouldn’t expect prices to settle down anytime soon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;Both Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;AMD expect&lt;/a&gt; it to linger for most of 2022, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;Intel suggested last month&lt;/a&gt; that it likely won’t be resolved until 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;The chip shortage is a complicated problem,&lt;/a&gt; and it takes time to spin up additional factories to satisfy demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTWhqz"&gt;Over the past year, using a very particular set of skills I have acquired over a long career as a dealhunter, I managed to snap up a $499 PS5 and a $399 Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Founder’s Edition at MSRP. They’re worth roughly $2,317 today, not that I plan to sell. Here’s hoping next check-in, those prices will have gone way down.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Qualcomm exclusivity deal for Windows on Arm reportedly ending soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YBI5pg2qxhJd28XoiXRsVuekG0o=/0x3:2239x1496/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181604/Windows_10_ARM_Microsoft_Qualcomm.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fXIRW"&gt;Qualcomm reportedly has an exclusivity deal with Microsoft for Windows on Arm licenses. The pair launched Windows on Arm laptops in 2016, and so far we haven’t seen any devices launch without a Qualcomm chip. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-exclusivity-deal-microsoft-windows-on-arm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Qualcomm has had an exclusivity deal on Windows on Arm, but that it’s set to expire soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFA1FO"&gt;The report comes days after MediaTek held its executive summit with members of the media last week, where it shared its ambitions to build its own chip for Windows on Arm PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlACLx"&gt;If Microsoft’s exclusivity deal is about to end with Qualcomm, this could open the door for many more vendors supporting Windows on Arm. Samsung, MediaTek, and even Apple’s M1 chips could eventually support Windows on Arm. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Osx2JGpWq-JuqaS_bxzHkKo8OPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19250204/akrales_190930_3682_0006_right.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s custom SQ1 Qualcomm chip for the Surface Pro X (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dgXxix"&gt;While you can run Windows on Apple’s M1 Macs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383598/parallels-desktop-mac-windows-10-install-m1-macbook"&gt;through Parallels Desktop&lt;/a&gt; virtual machine software, Apple does not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;support Boot Camp on M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft only licenses the Arm version of Windows to PC makers. Whether or not Microsoft would license Windows on Arm to Apple, or Apple would support such a scenario remains to be seen, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLUuk5"&gt;Microsoft has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;working on designing its own Arm-based processors&lt;/a&gt; for servers and possibly future Surface devices. The software giant started work on these new chips more than a year ago, and reports suggest they’ll be used primarily in servers for Microsoft’s Azure cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dER52U"&gt;Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup runs on Intel chips. Microsoft did break from tradition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20888999/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-custom-processor-qualcomm-amd-specs"&gt;work with AMD and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; for custom chips for its Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X devices. There are &lt;a href="https://www.clien.net/service/board/park/16536544"&gt;even rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is also working with AMD on Arm-based laptop processors.&lt;/p&gt;
