    <title>Texas is set to pass a new law banning Facebook from censoring conservatives</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SHQd9DjmtSLS1l74gI8WpI8CYY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805013/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wj6U5c"&gt;Texas is one step closer to enacting a law that would make it more difficult for social media companies to moderate political content. Both Texas’ House and Senate approved the bill earlier this week, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2FcAI"&gt;The bill would make it unlawful for social media companies with more than 50 million users, like Facebook and Twitter, to censor users and content based on political views or geographic location. This includes moderation actions like banning, deplatforming, or demonetizing users and removing posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9j9BA0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill initially failed in a special session earlier this year &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PkJCT8"&gt;The bill initially failed in a special session earlier this year when Democrats fled the state to stall the passage of controversial partisan bills, including measures to ban abortions once &lt;a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2021/09/01/407551/texas-now-has-a-ban-on-abortions-as-early-as-five-weeks-anti-abortion-groups-are-prepared-to-enforce-it/"&gt;a fetal heartbeat&lt;/a&gt; is detected and new voting restrictions. The social media “censorship” bill was revived in July in a second special session. It was approved in the House on Monday and the Senate late Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hf4wSN"&gt;It’s unclear when Abbott may sign the bill. His office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZW1cRz"&gt;Texas is the second state to push through a bill aimed at combating the alleged censorship of conservatives online. In May, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a similar measure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;would fine platforms&lt;/a&gt; for banning political candidates. The law was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558086/florida-social-media-theme-park-law-preliminary-injunction-lawsuit"&gt;blocked by a Florida US District&lt;/a&gt; Court judge in June. The judge wrote that much of the bill’s text was “wholly at odds with accepted constitutional principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3O8709"&gt;The Texas bill could face a similar fate, according to experts. “While the language in Texas’s bill is different, the outcome will be the same because the First Amendment protects against government intrusion into editorial discretion,” Ari Cohn, TechFreedom counsel, said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMErdh"&gt;The bill was widely opposed by Democrats, but many did not attend the vote as they protested other controversial measures led by Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v686Hn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 are delayed again due to COVID concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RIHuoqlRpyxw_g8EWSUfmADWcIg=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805006/top_gun_maverick.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WXClTS"&gt;Paramount is delaying the rest of its 2021 film slate, moving &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; from its Thanksgiving weekend release date to May 27th, 2022, close to three years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699765/top-gun-maverick-tom-cruise-sequel-trailer-watch-san-diego-comic-con-2019-ed-harris"&gt;after it was first announced&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also moving &lt;em&gt;Jackass Forever &lt;/em&gt;to release on February 4th, 2022, instead of the originally planned October 22nd, 2021, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/top-gun-maverick-flies-from-thanksgiving-to-memorial-day-weekend-mission-impossible-7-ignites-in-fall-2022-1234825624/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67tUgQ"&gt;Additionally, due to &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; taking its former May 2022 slot, &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt; is getting another delay: it’ll now be out on September 30th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUWUQd"&gt;The delays are due to concerns over the spike in COVID-19 cases caused by the delta variant of the virus. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; notes that Paramount, rather than risk releasing potential billion-dollar franchise starters like the &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; sequel seeing comparatively lackluster pandemic box office numbers, would rather just kick everything down the line in hopes that things will continue to improve in 2022. It’s for a similar reason that Paramount isn’t just shifting the films to its Paramount Plus streaming service — there’s simply too much money at stake here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4qXdrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More major movies are skipping 2021 releases in hope of better 2022 success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcKJGU"&gt;The news comes after Paramount had previously moved its &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/clifford-the-big-red-dog-release-delayed-paramount-1234807014/"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Clifford the Big Red Dog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movie off of its September 17th release date over similar COVID-19 delays. The studio has yet to announce a new date for the movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aqmj2"&gt;Despite Paramount’s move, there are still several major films set to hit theaters in the coming months (at least, for now). Disney still has &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; set to bring the MCU back to theatrical exclusivity on September 3rd, followed by &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; on November 5th. &lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/em&gt; is slated for October 18th (although there have been rumors of Sony considering a delay), &lt;em&gt;Ghostbuster: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; on November 19th (as Sony &lt;a href="https://bleedingcool.com/movies/sony-delays-ghostbusters-afterlife-a-week-after-top-gun-moves-to-2022/"&gt;moves to take &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt;’s vacated spot&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; set for December. There’s also the long-delayed James Bond film, &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, which was one of the first films to be impacted by COVID-19 delays. It is set to finally hit theaters in the US on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9izJIR"&gt;Lastly, Warner Bros. still has some of its biggest tent poles on the calendar for the end of 2021: &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; (on October 22nd) and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; (on December 22nd.) Unlike the previously mentioned films, though, those movies won’t be theatrical exclusives. Thanks to WarnerMedia’s unique 2021 release strategy, they’ll also be available on HBO Max the same day that they debut in theaters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants a Watch with more health tracking and could ship one next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Watch with a red wristband sitting on a table, showing the blood oxygen app. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Z__tueWCUapiDH9cJIZsAxj8gk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804936/vpavic_200930_4216_0239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xqG5yh"&gt;Apple apparently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has a growing wishlist of health features for future versions of the Apple Watch, some feasible and some far-fetched. According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s plans include various types of monitoring, including blood pressure, temperature, sleep, and blood sugar. The details come just after reports that the release of the next Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;likely to be delayed&lt;/a&gt; because of manufacturing issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upEVw8"&gt;Some of the planned features outlined by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; involve adding new sensors to the Watch. Apple wants to develop a sensor that can act as a proxy for a blood pressure cuff without squeezing the wrist. Blood pressure measurement has been in Apple’s plans for years; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17438526/apple-blood-pressure-monitor-patent-apple-watch"&gt;filed a patent application&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 for a wearable blood pressure monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjcQv0"&gt;Apple’s competitors are also interested in blood pressure tracking. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch was approved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295264/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-blood-pressure-tracking-ecg-korea"&gt;track changes in blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea last year. There’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236373/samsung-galaxy-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-health-fda"&gt;debate around the accuracy&lt;/a&gt; and usefulness of the feature, and it has to be calibrated with measurements from conventional blood pressure cuffs every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDY6p1"&gt;Apple had plans to add a temperature sensor to this year’s Watch, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;earlier reports from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the addition appears to have been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pushed to next year. The first slated use for temperature sensing, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, might involve&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fertility tracking, with hopes that it could eventually detect fevers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1WvhI"&gt;Other wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon’s Halo Band&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;Fitbit’s Sense&lt;/a&gt;, have sensors for skin temperature, though that measurement is different from the internal body temperature read by a thermometer. Earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568421/natural-cycles-birth-control-app-oura-ring-fda"&gt;Food and Drug Administration cleared digital birth control Natural Cycles&lt;/a&gt; to use temperature data from wearables like the Oura smart ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NgLwoY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has been chasing some of these features for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdi1vg"&gt;Apple also wants to expand the Watch’s sleep and blood oxygen tracking abilities, says the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, to someday be able to detect sleep apnea, a disorder that causes people to stop breathing during sleep. Sleep disorders are complicated, and diagnostic sleep studies involve multiple kinds of monitoring through the night. For that feature to work,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Apple would probably&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have to figure out the best times to take blood oxygen readings — keeping the sensor on all night would drain the battery pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRrjFm"&gt;Apple reportedly also plans to seek FDA clearance for existing Watch features, like heart rhythm tracking for people with irregular heart rhythms and alerts for drops in blood oxygen levels. The current FDA clearance for the Watch’s EKG feature doesn’t include use by people who have a diagnosed heart rhythm condition like atrial fibrillation, and the Watch’s blood oxygen monitor isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;cleared as a medical device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV5fIQ"&gt;One of the furthest-out features that Apple is continuing to study, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, is blood sugar tracking and diabetes detection. Apple has been trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15685148/apple-watch-glucose-tracker-blood-sugar-monitoring-diabetes"&gt;develop noninvasive glucose monitoring&lt;/a&gt; for years and reportedly hasn’t had much success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2xPcL"&gt;The anonymous sources cited by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; caution that many of the features being considered “might never be rolled out to consumers.” Health tech advancements, and regulatory approval for them, take years of development and testing. As much as companies want to add a slew of health features to wearables — and even as wearables are more commonly used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;in medical research&lt;/a&gt; — they’re still not advanced enough to replace&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;conventional diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVxMIO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s new Safety Mode autoblocks abusive accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xyj_IPwyKwHrLf2_phgEgZ05mE=/0x3:3564x2379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804597/safetymodeasset.png.img.fullhd.medium.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what Safety Mode settings look like.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WjTw4V"&gt;Twitter is launching &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-safety-mode"&gt;a new feature called Safety Mode&lt;/a&gt; that will temporarily autoblock accounts sending harmful or abusive tweets to you. Safety Mode is launching in beta with a “small feedback group” of accounts on iOS, Android, and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com"&gt;Twitter.com&lt;/a&gt; with English-language settings enabled and plans of expanding the group of testers “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NegCWC"&gt;“When the feature is turned on in your Settings, our systems will assess the likelihood of a negative engagement by considering both the Tweet’s content and the relationship between the Tweet author and replier,” senior product manager Jarrod Doherty &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-safety-mode"&gt;said in a blog&lt;/a&gt; post. “Our technology takes existing relationships into account, so accounts you follow or frequently interact with will not be autoblocked.” Accounts are temporarily blocked for seven days, but the company says you can undo autoblocks made in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TNUSfo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now testing: Safety Mode to help reduce disruptive interactions on Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Automatically block accounts that add unwelcome replies, Quote Tweets, and mentions to your convos. If you're in the test, you can turn on Safety Mode in your "Privacy and safety" settings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/n6zlO6fhK3"&gt;https://t.co/n6zlO6fhK3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1433101688462790659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6bsCU"&gt;Twitter showed off Safety Mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301388/twitter-auto-block-mute-abusive-accounts-safety-mode"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; at its Analyst Day presentation, but at the time, we didn’t know when it would officially roll out. This is Twitter’s latest feature that attempts to reduce abuse on the platform. Other recent features include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874847/twitter-feature-launch-us-japan-rollout-hide-replies"&gt;hiding replies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362514/twitter-reply-limiting-features-all-users-harassment-rollout-available-now"&gt;letting people limit&lt;/a&gt; who can reply to their posts, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420586/twitter-offensive-tweet-warning-prompt-updated-success-rate"&gt;showing a warning&lt;/a&gt; before you tweet a potentially harmful reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPihii"&gt;Despite the new features, harassment continues to be a major problem on the platform, as evidenced recently by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618500/twitter-analysis-racist-abuse-euro-2020-identification"&gt;torrent of racist abuse&lt;/a&gt; against Black players on England’s football team following their Euro 2020 championship loss. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will dish out all 180 episodes of Seinfeld starting on October 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BsDSZl-cA-m2UeQjm5pR6zthSEY=/477x0:2880x1602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804585/Screen_Shot_2021_09_01_at_9.10.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Rr5jK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1433067121416839168"&gt;Netflix has announced&lt;/a&gt; that the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the streaming service starting on October 1st. The show hasn’t been available on a streaming service since it went of Hulu on June 23rd, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/06/seinfeld-not-on-streaming-netflix-hulu.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s probably some pent-up demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPpGYi"&gt;Not only will &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; be available to view again, but it may end up looking better than viewers remember. When Netflix first announced that it was buying the show’s streaming rights, it said it would &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-09-16/netflix-acquires-the-global-streaming-rights-to-seinfeld"&gt;stream it in 4K&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UC71Kf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All 180 episodes of Seinfeld hit Netflix on October 1 &lt;a href="https://t.co/H73RZvNUw9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/H73RZvNUw9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1433067121416839168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zNUEHm"&gt;Netflix announced that it acquired the rights to &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20868736/seinfeld-netflix-2021-hulu-friends-streaming-wars"&gt;almost two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, Netflix was fixing to lose &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; to the then-upcoming HBO Max, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174856/the-office-netflix-peacock-streaming"&gt;along with &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which went to NBCUniversal’s Peacock. &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;seemingly&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;hasn’t been as big of a hit as the other two shows on streaming. &lt;a href="https://uproxx.com/tv/seinfeld-netflix-the-office-friends/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uproxx&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; made up 4 percent of Netflix’s viewing and &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; 7 percent. &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; was less than a percent of Hulu’s views, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/16/netflix-snags-seinfeld-as-streaming-wars-heat-up.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkwkXg"&gt;Still, it’s definitely a solid get for Netflix. Streaming culture seems to focus on big first-party releases from the major studios like Netflix and Disney, but people fill in the gaps between them by rewatching old shows over and over — the viewing &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; seems particularly suited to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dR4HGY"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld, the titular comedian and part of the creative team behind the ’90s show, jokingly said in a statement that he was “enormously grateful to Netflix” for taking a chance on the show, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/seinfeld-streaming-netflix-october-2021-1235053416/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For those also looking to take a chance on the show, we now know when it’ll be available again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse accused of fraud and is facing an SEC investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NCInvP3ff0U-51kKRtSrgXviyQU=/143x0:1138x663/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804571/c1000white21.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nI5Rn7"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has been accused of touting fake preorders, accounting fraud, and hiding a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation from its investors in a new report published &lt;a href="https://fuzzypandaresearch.com/workhorse-group-sec-investigation-fake-order-book/"&gt;by short-selling research firm Fuzzy Panda&lt;/a&gt;. The report also contains allegations that Workhorse’s new electric vans are already breaking down for customers like Ikea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mvnex4"&gt;Workhorse announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;just last month&lt;/a&gt; that it already needs to redesign the new C-1000 van based on early feedback, though the company said it was because customers wanted more payload capacity. The company also named a new CEO at the time, Rick Dauch, who came from automotive supplier Delphi, while its general counsel and vice president of finance announced they were leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv7Gof"&gt;The report also comes as Workhorse is in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557764/workhorse-complaint-oshkosh-usps-mail-truck-fight"&gt;legal battle in Federal Claims Court&lt;/a&gt;, where it is trying to overturn the United States Postal Service’s decision to tap defense contractor Oshkosh to build its next-generation mail truck. Workhorse was one of two companies that lost to Oshkosh when the award was announced in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mELGk"&gt;Workhorse didn’t respond to requests for comment or answer questions about the claims made in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4qlpYT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The investigation comes as Workhorse is still fighting over losing the USPS contract&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XkhOwm"&gt;Workhorse is the latest EV startup to become a target of short-sellers who bet that the stock price of a company will go down and often try to uncover information to support that bet. There has been a massive increase in potential targets, too, as dozens of startups — including many in the automotive space — have gone public in the last year, despite not yet running revenue-generating businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yogwpt"&gt;Perhaps most famously to date, Hindenburg Research published a report last year about potential fraud at Nikola, including that the startup filmed one of its trucks rolling down a hill but tried to make it look like it was being driven. The report led to SEC and Department of Justice investigations, and just last month, Nikola’s founder and former CEO, Trevor Milton, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;was charged by both agencies with committing fraud&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PotsLP"&gt;Hindenburg Research also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year on Lordstown Motors, alleging that the EV startup was lying about the number and veracity of the preorders it took for its pickup truck. The company, in its own investigation, ultimately decided founder and CEO Steve Burns had indeed misled investors, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;he resigned&lt;/a&gt;. The startup is also facing investigations from the SEC and DOJ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAeVbo"&gt;Fuzzy Panda doesn’t have as extensive a track record as Hindenburg, but it lays out a paper trail to support many of its allegations. The firm discovered the SEC investigation after the agency denied a Freedom of Information Act request citing an “active and ongoing” probe, for instance. Workhorse, which has been public for years, hasn’t disclosed any SEC investigation in its financial filings, which could be considered misleading. (The SEC did not respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request to confirm the investigation.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZ3rve"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Suspect orders and problems with the vehicles Workhorse has delivered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcOkFu"&gt;One of the most recent orders that Workhorse has touted, for 20 C-1000s, is from a company that appears to have been set up just days before the announcement, according to Fuzzy Panda. What’s more, the president of that company was an employee of Workhorse at the time, according to his LinkedIn profile. (That company’s CEO, and the president, did not respond to requests for comment.) Fuzzy Panda also says it spoke to the head of Pritchard EV, a company that ordered some of Workhorse’s older trucks. Workhorse allegedly booked revenue for those trucks one quarter early, a possible accounting fraud violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVY02o"&gt;Other customers have allegedly had a lot of trouble with Workhorse’s vehicles, both old and new. Fuzzy Panda claims an Ikea distribution center in New York quickly gave up its C-1000s  after immediately dealing with quality problems, including the battery pack rapidly draining. Both FedEx and UPS also detailed the unreliability of Workhorse’s vehicles in previously unreported documents filed with the Department of Energy, which Fuzzy Panda uncovered. Despite this, Workhorse still touts FedEx and UPS as customers on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TANrZh"&gt;Workhorse is also still walking a financial tightrope. The startup has, in recent years, stayed afloat by borrowing money from hedge funds and selling off assets, including the intellectual property for the pickup truck Lordstown Motors is trying to build. But since Workhorse has struggled to get the C-1000 into production, it’s had to keep up that risky borrowing. To wit, its assets are being &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-gets-200-million-to-advance-electric-van-production"&gt;used as collateral for a $200 million loan&lt;/a&gt; it took in late 2020 — including the minority ownership stake it has in Lordstown Motors. As Fuzzy Panda points out, the Lordstown Motors stake (and the nearly $80 million Workhorse has received so far from selling shares) is being held by a special purpose vehicle LLC. If Workhorse defaults on the loan, the lender (another hedge fund, Antara) could take over that LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4qwSC"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter launches Super Follows on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J92uI4iFnzll2RNp38yjJQGFanI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804524/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T6VoHA"&gt;Twitter is starting to roll out Super Follows, its new feature that lets users charge for subscriber-only content. Creators can set their tweets to go out to Super Followers only, and the tweets will appear in the timelines of just those subscribers. The feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt;, is currently only available on Twitter’s iOS app and is limited to a test group of people in the US who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545167/twitter-opens-super-follows-ticketed-spaces-new-feature-test-application-ios-android"&gt;applied to try it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Phone screens showing a person making a tweet about a skincare q&amp;amp;amp;a and setting it to Super Followers. The tweet has a pink note under it that says “Only your Super Followers can see this” and a reply to the tweet shows “Super Follows you” under the follower’s name." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGPQksbaUoG32ml8F1L2a9ArnlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818293/Creator_view___all_screens.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CZcbYS"&gt;iOS users in the US and Canada can Super Follow accounts that are in the initial test group. Super Followers are identified to creators by a badge that appears under their name when they reply to tweets. Twitter plans to roll out the feature on iOS in more countries in the coming weeks and says it will be available on Android and the web soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zt6ITC"&gt;Super Follows users can charge $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 a month, with payments processed through Stripe. Twitter says users can earn up to 97 percent of subscription revenue after third-party fees, until they reach a lifetime earnings limit of $50,000 across all Twitter monetization products. After hitting that limit, Twitter says users can earn up to 80 percent of revenue after third-party fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A person’s Twitter profile with a pink Super Follow button, and a subscription page saying “get bonus content when you subscribe” with an example that the person will share skincare tips that they don’t release to the public.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbqvcE"&gt;People who don’t have the Super Follows feature can apply for a waitlist under the monetization tab in the Twitter app. To be eligible, people need to have at least 10,000 followers, be at least 18 years old, have tweeted 25 times in the last 30 days, be in the US, and comply with Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/super-follows-policy"&gt;Super Follows policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSBG0d"&gt;Twitter has been exploring various monetization strategies for creators recently, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;tip jar feature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597576/twitter-shopping-module-pilot-gamestop-arden-cove-brands"&gt;shopping section&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632414/twitter-newsletter-subscription-button-revue-profile"&gt;newsletter subscription button&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter says it plans to add newsletters, anonymous subscriptions, exclusive Spaces, and Patreon-like subscription tiers to Super Follows. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s back-to-school gift guide 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nI_9UcQrSU-sXPEHN0FMm9aKrhs=/143x0:1156x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644114/VRG_ILLO_4675_BTS_GG_2021_LEDE.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts for high schoolers and the college bound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iYqwJ1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School is back in session&lt;/strong&gt; — well, almost. After a turbulent year and a half, many high school and college campuses are looking to return to in-person classes in the fall as vaccination rates continue to climb and the US enters a new phase of the pandemic. Some students will continue to study remotely as a result of the delta variant. Some will opt for a hybrid approach. But all will need supplies to carry out their coursework and make the most of their precious time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fR5Sp"&gt;If you’re not sure about what to get the student in your life, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff has corralled a list of items that are sure to please high school students, college kids, and post-grads alike. Some, like Logitech’s C920S webcam ($60) and the 2020 MacBook Air ($950), are practical favorites, while others, like &lt;em&gt;Salt Fat Acid Heat&lt;/em&gt; ($17), are meant to appease the student in all of us, whether you’re involved in academics or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2BDkl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you’re looking for a wider selection of laptop picks, we also have guides to the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best laptops for students&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic admits it needs to communicate better with Pokémon Go players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TiCSj5sU9zyrQNHl1wdX2afZbic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804127/jbareham_160711_1134_0005_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRurPf"&gt;Last month Niantic sparked a backlash in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; community when it announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605874/pokemon-go-pokestop-distance-halved-us-new-zealand"&gt;reverse some of the changes&lt;/a&gt; it made last year to make the game more playable while staying at home. The company said it would set up a “task force” to figure out the best way to move forward and would announce its findings by today, September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUoay0"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642030/niantic-pokemon-go-pandemic-interaction-distance-80-meters"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, the first main point of action is that Niantic will keep the 80-meter interaction distance for pokéstops and gyms everywhere around the world, after first saying it’d revert to the pre-pandemic 40-meter distance first in the US and New Zealand. Niantic now says it realizes that altering mechanics like this in a real-time, region-specific manner is impractical, and will apply features in the same way across the globe going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CqScUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qmcMo1"&gt;“We went through a rough learning experience recently when we had to adjust the game settings for New Zealand quickly in response to their lockdown,” executive producer Steve Wang says in a statement. “This experience taught us that we are not going to be able to effectively adjust the experience on a country-by-country basis in real-time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgCYzC"&gt;Wang says that while the increased interaction distance will stay, the team still believes that discovering things in the real world is an important part of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and plans to “develop new ways that motivate and reward Trainers for exploring and exercising in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWMetl"&gt;The other main finding of the task force was that Niantic “has a lot of room to grow when it comes to communication with our players.” To that end, the company says it’ll post bi-monthly developer diaries to “share the latest priorities, events, and features,” and will engage in “regular conversations with community leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kXUWa"&gt;Niantic isn’t giving a whole lot of new, concrete information here, but it’s quite unusual for a gaming company to call itself out like this. What will ultimately matter most, of course, is how it handles similar situations in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TimTheTatman, one of Twitch’s biggest streamers, moves to YouTube Gaming</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjn1tr"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatMan” Betar, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, is leaving &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766"&gt;to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. His move comes just days after another big streamer, Ben “DrLupo” Lupo, announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;he’d be switching from Twitch to YouTube as well&lt;/a&gt;. Betar’s first stream will take place on September 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCusxz"&gt;In moving from Twitch, Betar is leaving behind &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/timthetatman"&gt;the 7 million followers&lt;/a&gt; he’s accrued on the Amazon-owned platform. But he won’t be starting from scratch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/timthetatman"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, where he already has 3.8 million subscribers. YouTube declined to comment on the terms of its deal with Betar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wRaYM6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/timthetatman-will-leave-twitch-for-youtube-2021-8"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Betar said the move will let him spend more time with his family. “When I started, I had no family obligations and I could [stream] a lot of hours,” he said to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “The reality is, now that I’ve got my wife and my son, it’s hard for me to stream as much as I did beforehand.” Lupo, in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/30/drlupo-twitch-youtube-exclusive-deal/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, similarly indicated that his YouTube Gaming deal would give him more family time and said that the deal he was presented with would let him be “secure for life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiaxD7"&gt;Betar and Lupo’s moves follow earlier switches made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; and signal that YouTube Gaming might be investing more in bringing big names to the platform. YouTube Gaming still sees far fewer hours watched than Twitch does, &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;according to Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, so the signings could help YouTube close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmSbGb"&gt;In an acknowledgment of the move, Twitch shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937"&gt;a montage of Betar on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, including the iconic moment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376298/timthetatman-fall-guys-victory-win-finally-twitch-live"&gt;when he finally won a game of &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tqrbby"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You'll always be a King to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for everything, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@timthetatman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/keeZeElnpm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/keeZeElnpm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="yu1ORR"&gt;“It’s been great to see all that TimTheTatman has achieved since being partnered in 2012 on Twitch — whether it was marrying the love of his life and welcoming an heir to the Tatman throne, or the trials and tribulations of achieving his first Fall Guys crown,” a Twitch spokesperson said in a statement. “It’s been a pleasure being part of Tim’s community, and we are proud of everything he has done for gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrjvMO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 1st, 1:16PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that YouTube declined to comment on its deal with Betar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
