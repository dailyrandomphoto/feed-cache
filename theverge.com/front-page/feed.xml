    <title>Joe Biden pledges to drastically slash US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks And Signs Executive Actions On Climate Change And Creating Jobs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHyvWSRc3YLalRvqWfJBD2JOSD0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167893/1230821964.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U946jq"&gt;President Joe Biden announced a new goal to sharply cut down US greenhouse gas emissions this decade. The country’s new mandate is to reduce planet-heating gases by 50 to 52 percent of what the US emitted in 2005. It significantly ramps up a previous commitment under the Paris climate agreement made by former President Barack Obama, who pledged to slash emissions between 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ft5jLG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US hopes to regain respect on the international stage &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WlUYTP"&gt;The urgency for the US to gut its climate pollution has only grown since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015. Global carbon dioxide emissions need to drop by half this decade and reach close to zero by the middle of the century in order to hit the goals of the Paris Agreement and prevent some of the most devastating effects of climate change, a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt; found. The US has a huge role to play as the second biggest greenhouse gas polluter after China. But it abdicated leadership on the climate front under former President Donald Trump, who briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548147/united-states-paris-agreement-climate-change-presidential-election"&gt;pulled the US out&lt;/a&gt; of the Paris accord and &lt;a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/climate-deregulation-tracker"&gt;drastically rolled back&lt;/a&gt; environmental regulations in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEX9HE"&gt;Now the US hopes to regain respect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;on the international stage&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. Biden will hold his own &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/leaders-summit-on-climate/"&gt;virtual summit&lt;/a&gt; on climate today (Earth Day) and tomorrow aimed at encouraging other countries to ratchet up their goals. All countries are expected to update their individual commitments to combating climate change ahead of a United Nations climate conference scheduled to take place in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJJ8sQ"&gt;“[The Biden administration is] very cognizant that the US as a credible actor and leader in this space really depends in large measure on having a really robust new target,” says Pete Ogden, vice president for energy, climate, and the environment at the United Nations Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43eT24"&gt;Major environmental groups like Sierra Club have &lt;a href="https://addup.sierraclub.org/campaigns/tell-president-biden-commit-the-us-to-reducing-climate-emissions-by-at-least-50-by-2030"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; the Biden administration to target a reduction of at least 50 percent. Hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/ambitious-u-s-2030-ndc/"&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt;, including Amazon, Apple, and General Motors, did also. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFzoMe"&gt;Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-government-and-politics-environment-and-nature-business-climate-8b27e89270de7cb03f2e61f23d0ba4b9?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=122623923&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d1EiTS1GYd8wQXq7HwM3WLwLsbvmcJ4hyCpHseNPDbjQMNaB6uugUmcQYZDz9aA3JomNV5K0H90xvIik4zUGT0DRNNBjA9bTIUyqIBfgqfYqXu0c&amp;amp;utm_content=122623923&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the 50 percent goal “is precisely what is needed ... an actionable goal within the next decade that puts us on the path toward limiting warming below a catastrophic 1.5 degrees Celsius.″  The Paris agreement seeks to stop global average temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;threshold&lt;/a&gt; that scientists project would lead to catastrophic effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCJ5jf"&gt;Some progressive groups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;called for deeper emissions cuts&lt;/a&gt;, citing the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;US’s history of contributing more to the climate crisis&lt;/a&gt; than any other country. “There exists in my mind no possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;said Tom Athanasiou&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the activist think tank EcoEquity, which is part of a &lt;a href="https://usfairshare.org/"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; that has called on the US to reduce its emissions by at least 70 percent below 2005 levels this decade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI32R6"&gt;More countries are expected to ratchet up ambitions this week during Biden’s climate summit. The UK announced on April 20 that it plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 78 percent compared to 1990 levels by the year 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pG3I9f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a dire warning.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqV8Kp"&gt;Those commitments couldn’t come any sooner as climate pollution continues to grow. After a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;temporary drop&lt;/a&gt; in planet-warming CO2 emissions during the pandemic, annual emissions this year are on course for the sharpest rise since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN6aYL"&gt;“This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-are-set-for-their-second-biggest-increase-in-history"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the new estimate for 2021 emissions. “Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzIJCr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drKa4d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSRbMs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKDXYB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s solar panels will soon only be sold in bundles with Powerwall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Solar Roof" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lsl_dTJ8P4gkIm_zDrOWTVMoI_w=/216x0:1784x1045/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167810/tesla_solar_roof_smooth_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tesla’s solar roof.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YH5WU4"&gt;Tesla’s solar products will soon only be sold together with the company’s Powerwall battery, CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385042598692147204"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Integrating them into a single product will making installations easier and home backup more seamless during outages, according to Musk. The change will affect both Tesla’s Solar Panels (which sit on top of an existing roof), and Solar Roof (which replaces a home’s existing roof slats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aoKIA"&gt;The new policy was announced just hours after Musk responded to a tweet from Ark Investment Management’s director of research Brett Winton, who had complained that his Tesla solar panels hadn’t generated any electricity since installation because he was waiting on his local utility company to approve the connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3VIjnp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp;amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp;amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385048499415183360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FtuU27"&gt;“Did you buy a Powerwall?” Musk tweeted at Winton, “Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery.” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/telsa-s-solar-panels-to-be-sold-with-powerwall-from-next-week?utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Ark Investment has been a big supporter of Tesla, and holds “significant stakes” in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VKqK20"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp;amp; can stabilize grid.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385011236270526464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W79UAP"&gt;Signs of Tesla’s intention to bundle its solar products with the Powerwall were reported &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/15/tesla-stops-taking-orders-powerwall-without-solar-panels/"&gt;last month by &lt;em&gt;Elektrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who spotted that the company was only accepting new Powerwall orders when combined with a Tesla solar panel project. Powerwall supply shortages were thought to be to blame for the shift, with demand and wait times increasing for the home battery solution. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Tesla installed 86 mega-watts (MW) of solar energy, a 59 percent increase compared to the same period the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zhehxr"&gt;Alongside the change, Musk announced an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385099771220688906"&gt;upcoming software update&lt;/a&gt; for the Powerwall, which he says will enable upwards of a 50 percent power increase depending on production date. The current Powerwall is &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/Powerwall%202_AC_Datasheet_en_northamerica.pdf"&gt;rated to provide&lt;/a&gt; 5 kW of real power (7 kW peak) in North America, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385105599608672257"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; the CEO said that Tesla’s newest units can “probably” provide as much as 10kW continuous, and “double that in peak” under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YAGZP"&gt;The changes come after Tesla faced criticism for substantially raising the prices of some of its solar products. Earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380057/tesla-solar-roof-price-increase-contract-amount"&gt;one customer reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company had told them a $35,000 solar roof order would now cost them $75,000, while the price of the accompanying batteries would increase from $30,000 to $35,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzgwtp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNDjYn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm is releasing a Nintendo-themed Instax printer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uMJnRAtuboMbktKKyqdszqyIsqU=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167794/fujinintendo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lOpF6S"&gt;Fujifilm and Nintendo have &lt;a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/jp/en/news/hq/6480"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new collaboration. The camera company is releasing a new Switch-themed version of its Instax Mini Link photo printer, as well as a new app that’s designed to let you edit Switch screenshots and print them out onto Fujifilm’s Polaroid-style Instax film, or add Nintendo characters to your photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgvJam"&gt;You can transfer screenshots from your Switch to the new “instax mini Link for Nintendo Switch” app with a QR code. The app contains filters and 59 new frames from games like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, and appropriately enough the upcoming &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap. &lt;/em&gt;Here’s how some of the frames look:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WaRn8B63WmfFBBfhvF_HTsWTS5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461719/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_17.03.52.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IiLPZnwW9yfe1UOt85Sa3B6pTG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461720/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_17.07.20.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bPiYLe"&gt;The actual printer hardware itself is identical to the existing Instax Mini Link, but it comes in Switch-inspired red and blue trim and there’s a bundle with a frankly adorable Pikachu silicone case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8l2N2t7svJNIJmZtRpPnPE8fkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461721/fujinintendo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xEMkws"&gt;Fujifilm says the app and the printer will be released on April 30th. The special edition Mini Link will cost $100, while the Pikachu case bundle will sell for $120 later in May. The app will be free to download and will still work with existing Instax Mini Link printers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gran Turismo will be featured in an Olympic competition this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WaZoS2ikC4m18CfRHNinRVnml8=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167772/gran_turismo_7_screenshot_08_disclaimer_en_01oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4COlEW"&gt;The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced a new series of virtual sporting events that will take place ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, called the Olympic Virtual Series. No, this doesn’t mean that &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; just became an Olympic sport — what’s happening is that the IOC is partnering with five international sports federations to host virtual competitions in games featuring their sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVAUkW"&gt;The Olympic Virtual Series will kick off on May 13th and will run through June 23rd. Here’s the lineup of federations and what games they’ll be hosting events for, as we know it so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hgz7N4"&gt;Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile will host a &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo &lt;/em&gt;competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vBXVEt"&gt;Union Cycliste Internationale will host a competition for &lt;em&gt;Zwift&lt;/em&gt;, which offers virtual cycling and running courses to use with indoor exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EiAMjx"&gt;The World Baseball Softball Confederation will host a competition for Konami’s &lt;em&gt;eBaseball Powerful Pro Baseball 2020&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M2ffAN"&gt;World Sailing will host a competition for &lt;em&gt;Virtual Regatta&lt;/em&gt;, an online sailing and regatta sailing simulation game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cgGmUT"&gt;World Rowing doesn’t officially have a game attached to it yet; a press release only said vaguely that there would be an “open format.” A PR spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that details about the World Rowing competition are forthcoming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cnyhyN"&gt;There are still many things we don’t know about the Olympic Virtual Series. It’s still unclear who will be competing, how you can try to sign up to compete, what prizes will be offered (will somebody become a &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; gold medalist?), and which events will happen when. The IOC promises that more details will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9S2ZFW"&gt;More sports could get involved in future virtual series. FIFA, the International Basketball Federation, the International Tennis Federation, and World Taekwondo have “confirmed their excitement and commitment to exploring inclusion in future editions of the OVS,” the IOC said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony releases a more powerful wearable AC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5XYoxKT67SHy7xzAVF4vuMVotPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69167770/DSCF7272.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The original Reon Pocket.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqUgxp"&gt;Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/ja/SonyInfo/News/Press/202104/21-034/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a follow-up product to the Reon Pocket, the app-controlled “wearable air conditioner” it released last year after crowdfunding it on the company’s own platform. The Reon Pocket 2 looks more or less the same as the original model, but the newly designed internals can achieve up to twice the level of heat absorption, according to Sony, resulting in more powerful cooling performance. Sony also says that it’s improved the sweat-proofing in the Reon Pocket 2, making it more suitable for light exercise situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWSXfk"&gt;The prior model was mostly marketed as something to wear with a special undershirt to make summer commuting more bearable, but this time around Sony is emphasizing more versatile use cases — particularly golf. The company has partnered with sportswear brands including Le Coq Sportif, Munsingwear, and Descente to produce a range of golf clothing that features pockets for the device to slot into.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rLT1qI7BxMQlzSbTP6mn4n2FRvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461704/img_w02_pc.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xla5n6"&gt;Sony has also designed a neckstrap accessory so that the Reon Pocket can be used with regular clothes. Previously, you’d have to buy a bunch of pocketed undershirts from Sony.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder on the maker’s site or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACO1OVMfOG9bRTqGaMafFuiVKRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457922/7245bb43_16cd_47d2_9cb4_94bc7f177b9a.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergAirTag042121&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ndRFmc"&gt;Moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmqR6X"&gt;Moment, known for making add-on lenses for your phone, is now making some interesting AirTag accessories: they’re little patches, in a variety of materials, that let you discreetly stick an AirTag places, whether that’s on the inside of a backpack, jacket, bike seat, etc. The mounts are available for pre-order today, with the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fstretch-fabric-mount-for-airtags%2Fstretch-fabric-mount-for-airtags&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fabric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fcurved-surface-mount-for-airtags%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;curved-surface&lt;/a&gt; mounts costing $14.99 and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fhard-shell-mount-for-airtags%2F%23productImage1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-shell&lt;/a&gt; mount costing $19.99.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks like an evil red eye, which dbrand would probably appreciate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jk00Y1"&gt;dbrand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="B4yP8n"&gt;Device-customization company dbrand &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/apple-airtag-skins"&gt;is offering pre-orders for its skins&lt;/a&gt; (which sounds very creepy, without context) that allow users to change the color of their AirTags. A pack that allows you to add a dot of color to the front and back of the tracker will cost $4.95, and comes with dbrand’s promise to “make your tiny frisbee look and feel like it’s worth the four full-sized frisbees that your $29 could have bought instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxKfm0"&gt;The company is also creating a case, which adds the much-needed (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;or not, depending on who you ask&lt;/a&gt;) lanyard loop that Apple left off the AirTags. The case is available for pre-order, includes a lanyard loop, and costs $15 — there’s also a $19.95 pack &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/apple-airtag-cases"&gt;that also includes a skin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ENSzYI"&gt;Everybody else &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOHhl"&gt;Of course, with how long AirTags have been rumored, there were some manufacturers that wanted to get a head start with their accessories. Last night, we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393404/airtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile"&gt;various key rings show up on Walmart, Etsy, and eBay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney inks a huge Sony deal to bring Spider-Man and other films to Disney Plus and Hulu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOLcX8CHnWx5PdaDVmIMDu7Ps6M=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166381/SpiderHaal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yeoaDF"&gt;Disney and Sony Pictures have signed a multi-year “content licensing agreement” that will bring new Sony theatrical releases, starting with its 2022 films, to Disney-owned platforms. The deal also gives Disney the rights to many of Sony’s older films, including &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; titles — meaning that movies starring the web-slinger, which are notably absent from Disney Plus’ collection of Marvel films, could eventually make their way to the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEnFE"&gt;Sony’s theatrical releases from 2022 through 2026 are included in the deal, and Disney will get access to them following their “Pay 1 TV window.” Starting in 2022, that window, which follows a film’s theatrical and home video runs, will be owned by Netflix, thanks to a deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373997/sony-pictures-movies-netflix-starz-pay-one-window-streaming-deal"&gt;announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. (That means new Sony films will hit theaters first, then paid rentals and purchases, then Netflix, and then finally head over to Disney platforms, possibly including Disney Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUj2O2"&gt;So even though Disney and Sony’s deal means that Disney won’t have new &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films right after their theatrical runs, the company will get to include them in its streaming catalogue over the long term — something that Disney arguably values more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxBPVh"&gt;Giving people access to yet another set of movies in its ever-growing collection of Marvel properties could give people more reason to subscribe to Disney Plus. The company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231578/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-characters-mcu-audience"&gt;connect the many Marvel films and shows to each other&lt;/a&gt; so you’ll always want to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;the next new MCU thing&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s continuing to invest heavily in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394275/emilia-clarke-olivia-colman-marvel-secret-invasion-disney-plus"&gt;courting big names for future series&lt;/a&gt; to give you even more reasons to keep your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEPolr"&gt;That all said, if &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films do make their way to Disney Plus, that won’t make Disney’s infinity gauntlet of films complete: 2008’s &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt; (the one starring Edward Norton as the Hulk) would still not be available on the service. Unless Disney strikes some sort of deal with Universal, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Gzzq8"&gt;Other Sony Pictures properties, such as &lt;em&gt;Jumanji&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hotel Transylvania&lt;/em&gt;, are also included in the deal, according to a press release. Disney’s Hulu will also have access to “a significant number of library titles” as soon as this June, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 VR remake launches later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7yottfu6J-YKOPo1ZxBM_WjjMlM=/40x0:1405x910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166374/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_6.52.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IlnUy8"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs has offered more detail about a virtual reality remake of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;, following Capcom’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386496/resident-evil-4-vr-remake-oculus-quest-2-announced"&gt;original announcement last week&lt;/a&gt;. The game will launch later this year exclusively on Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 headset, although the exact date is still a mystery. As Capcom’s first trailer indicated, it’s a first-person VR adaptation of the 2005 third-person game, with a focus on making weapons and movement feel more natural with Oculus Touch motion controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oR87r6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; for VR uses the game’s original levels and animations, revamped with remastered textures, and Oculus says cutscenes will be rendered “in their original format.” But developer Armature Studio has added VR-friendly locomotion options like the ability to teleport or walk around a room-scale environment, in addition to using Touch controller analog sticks. You physically pick up weapons and items from the environment, and you can equip different weapons for each hand. The game’s enemies will also attack in ways that are optimized around first-person combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bAEbAB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu7vJYpakPU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ywAXlE"&gt;These additions evoke features popular in other VR first-person shooters like &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine, &lt;/em&gt;whose creator Vertigo also released a new trailer for its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Ffrom-the-creators-of-arizona-sunshine-after-the-fall-brings-four-player-co-op-action-to-vr-in-summer-2021%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;upcoming cooperative game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;After the Fall&lt;/em&gt; today. The &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; remake is part of &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/oculus-gaming-showcase/"&gt;a larger slate of upcoming VR games&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6BPFNxv8jQ"&gt;a sequel to the original Oculus Rift title &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s launching this summer, as well as a horror stealth game called &lt;em&gt;Wraith: The Oblivion – Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, which will launch tomorrow on Oculus Quest and Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="260xge"&gt;Capcom previously made &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; playable on PlayStation VR, but this is the first full-length &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil &lt;/em&gt;game designed for VR. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; is also the first Quest 2 app that won’t be playable on the original Oculus Quest. Oculus required all launch titles for the Quest 2 to be compatible with its predecessor, but it left the door open for an exclusive game that required the extra power of a newer headset — and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; is apparently that game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJ9cyi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_FJFnm9PCfY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The US has a long way to go to make up for its part in the climate crisis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks And Signs Executive Actions On Climate Change And Creating Jobs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUIAzRoMeumpooDurKj8-5b2UNg=/0x0:5676x3784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166361/1230821705.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;US President Joe Biden prepares to sign executive orders after speaking about climate change issues in the State Dining Room of the White House on January 27th, 2021, in Washington, DC. Biden signed several executive orders related to the climate change crisis.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cTxnEI"&gt;The US plans to officially ratchet up its climate commitments going into Earth Day tomorrow, but many advocates are skeptical that it will be ambitious enough to balance out the nation’s inordinate role in creating the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Z8HUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajesja"&gt;Biden is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/04/20/biden-climate-change/"&gt;expected to commit&lt;/a&gt; the US to slashing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least half compared to what they were in 2005. That’s already a significant ramp-up compared to the trajectory the US was on before. (Barack Obama committed the US to a roughly 27 percent cut by 2025.) But there’s still somewhat of a mismatch between what the US is willing to commit to and what some say it owes to the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMAWhE"&gt;“There exists in my mind no possible ethically justifiable story in which the United States does not do more,” says Tom Athanasiou, executive director of the activist think tank EcoEquity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaRsp1"&gt;Two specific targets have emerged as rallying calls since a landmark United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt; set out pathways to achieving the goals set in Paris: global emissions should reach net zero around 2050 and drop in about half compared to 2010 levels this decade. (While the United Nations report uses a 2010 baseline for pollution cuts, different countries use different years. The US uses 2005, around the time that its emissions peaked.) Biden’s been talking about reaching that 2050 goal domestically since he was on the campaign trail. Since then, hundreds of companies and some mainstream environmental groups &lt;a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/ambitious-u-s-2030-ndc/"&gt;have called for him&lt;/a&gt; to commit to the 2030 target, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqcd4t"&gt;But others say that target falls short and that the US should do much more because of how much fossil fuel pollution it’s created. China is currently the country that releases the most carbon dioxide emissions each year, so it also has a lot of responsibility. But cumulatively, the US has pumped out nearly &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1007454/cumulative-co2-emissions-worldwide-by-country/"&gt;twice as much&lt;/a&gt; carbon dioxide as China since 1750. Even today, the US’s modern &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions"&gt;per capita emissions&lt;/a&gt; are more than double that of China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cvCtx"&gt;That’s why Athanasiou, and the Climate Action Network that he’s part of, say that the US’s “&lt;a href="https://usfairshare.org/"&gt;fair share&lt;/a&gt;” of the work to address the climate crisis is much higher than the 50 percent reduction target for this decade. “If there’s a global average number, and you’re doing something fair, then the United States has to do more than the global average. End of story,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="CKrjE8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US’s “fair share” of the work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvTMDy"&gt;They’re asking the US to slash its emissions by 70 percent. The Climate Action Network also says the US has the responsibility and financial capacity to help developing nations with their emissions cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvA0P1"&gt;Another independent &lt;a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/1o5C-consistent-benchmarks-for-us-2030-climate-target/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that for Biden to hit his aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 and help the rest of the world do the same, he needs to up the ante. The US should slash pollution by between 57 to 63 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, according to the analysis by the nonprofit organizations NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics. It also said that the US would need to support other countries’ efforts to lower emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhmjbJ"&gt;So far, the US seems to be falling short when it comes to investing in pollution cuts elsewhere. An important piece of the Paris agreement is a Green Climate Fund established to help developing countries transition to clean energy. The Obama administration committed $3 billion to the fund but was only able to fulfill about $1 billion of it. Donald Trump then pulled the US out of the agreement and reneged on the remaining funds. When Biden recommitted the US to Paris, many thought he would follow through — and maybe even put down more cash. But they were &lt;a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/04/13/joe-bidens-1-2bn-budget-green-climate-fund-falls-short-campaigner-demands/"&gt;disappointed&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month when the president’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FY2022-Discretionary-Request.pdf"&gt;budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; only laid out an additional $1.2 billion for the fund — not even enough to make up for what Trump had previously backed out of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4J08dO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The world is teetering ever closer to catastrophe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17IleY"&gt;The US has a long way to go to show the world that it is actually serious about tackling the crisis again. When the US helped strike the Paris climate agreement in 2015, it promised, along with all of the other signatories, that in five years, it would submit even more ambitious commitments to tackle climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plVJG8"&gt;Those five years are up. Now, the world is teetering ever closer to catastrophe: it’s already heated by &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-was-one-of-three-warmest-years-record"&gt;1.2 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Celsius, close to the 1.5 degree threshold that the Paris agreement hoped to avoid. That’s why people around the world are holding their breath to learn what governments’ new commitments are. Of the almost 200 countries that signed the accord, some &lt;a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/2020-ndc-tracker"&gt;80 have already turned in&lt;/a&gt; their homework. Notably, the two top greenhouse gas polluters, China and the US, have not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyhaRj"&gt;“Many countries around the globe that are kind of hiding and saying, ‘Okay, we don’t move forward because we don’t see that the big economies are moving forward,’” says Gustavo de Vivero, a climate policy analyst at the NewClimate Institute and one of the authors of its recent analysis. “It’s extremely important [that the Biden administration] show commitment, show that it’s possible to go as high as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52hhCM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaHvpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Nelson backs NASA’s Moon plans, climate change work in confirmation hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBXnLI_OBhpKDa2jkLHQHmE9K7E=/0x0:5128x3419/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69166281/_MG_3326.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nelson smiles for cameras before his Senate confirmation hearing to be NASA’s 14th administrator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qeJKfO"&gt;President Biden’s pick for NASA administrator, former Sen. Bill Nelson, breezed through his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, as expected. Facing questions from his “old buddies” about NASA’s commercial partnerships, climate change, and workforce diversity, Nelson’s hearing was uneventful and garnered bipartisan praise. He backed the agency’s current plan to send its first crew of astronauts to the Moon on a SpaceX rocket and emphasized NASA’s role in studying climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5mJKa"&gt;Just over a month after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337787/biden-nasa-chief-choice-senator-bill-nelson"&gt;tapped&lt;/a&gt; by Biden for NASA chief, Nelson told lawmakers he supported the president’s 2022 summary budget request for NASA and defended the $2.3 billion it set out for the agency’s Earth sciences wing — a 15 percent increase from the prior year. “It’s a very important increase. You can’t mitigate climate change unless you measure it, and that’s NASA’s expertise,” he said. “Understanding our planet gives us the means to better protect it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFSUok"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/4AB228AD-89D0-459D-9ADD-16CBBB76838A"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; and remarks to lawmakers, Nelson, a former congressman and a three-term US senator from Florida, made “constancy of purpose” his priority if confirmed by the Senate. He plans to maintain the moonshot momentum that brewed under the Trump administration, while upping support for climate-focused objectives championed by Biden, including “climate change, educating and inspiring a diverse STEM workforce, building back better through innovation, and using space to create and strengthen global alliances and ensure U.S. global leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_31bc60Wv6m_75u0by3jXM28R0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460769/_MG_3360.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before his Senate confirmation hearing to be NASA administrator, Bill Nelson greets Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Nelson’s former colleague in the Senate and the first Republican to endorse Nelson’s nomination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="POtBHt"&gt;The hearing came less than a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;NASA picked Elon Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to build the country’s first human lunar lander since 1972, one of the most significant awards from the agency in years. The sole award was a surprise to many who expected NASA to pick two providers, either Blue Origin or Dynetics, who had also been developing rival landing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Samh18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nelson: “Space is hard”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z17Rc"&gt;Asked by senators where Nelson stands on NASA’s commercial partnerships and the Artemis program — the Trump administration’s agenda to land humans on the Moon by 2024 — Nelson supported the program and the agency’s decision to award SpaceX a sole lunar lander contract to mature Starship for NASA’s first two missions to the Moon (one uncrewed, the other crewed). Based on what he read in the news about SpaceX’s award, he said, NASA still has a shot at getting to the moon by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttenBM"&gt;“I think you may be pleased that we’re gonna see that timetable try to be adhered to, but recognize that with some sobering reality that space is hard,” Nelson said. Without naming SpaceX, he said NASA’s current “awardee” for the lander means NASA should try to stick to its 2024 date, a goal set by then-Vice President Mike Pence in 2019 that has been widely viewed as unrealistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44iCoo"&gt;That 2024 date wasn’t realistic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;Biden’s transition team found&lt;/a&gt;, because of funding shortfalls from Congress. But that was when NASA was still expected to pick two lunar lander providers&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Now with Starship as NASA’s initial ride to the Moon, which came at a price far lower than SpaceX’s rivals, agency officials might publicly stick with the 2024 goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45bR7G"&gt;Nelson’s support for the sole-source selection seemed reserved only for the initial phase of NASA’s human landing system program. NASA plans to invite more companies to compete for future lunar lander contracts. Asked if other elements of Artemis, like space suits, should be built by multiple companies instead of just one, Nelson said, “I do, senator. And competition is always better than sole-sourcing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajRaeW"&gt;Throughout the hearing, Nelson sprinkled praise for Jim Bridenstine, the former NASA chief whose past experience as a congressman proved crucial to rallying support for Trump’s Artemis program. Nelson railed against Bridenstine for being a politician during his confirmation hearing in 2018 but switched gears on Wednesday. “Jim had tremendous success in growing political and public support for NASA, particularly around the Artemis program,” Nelson said in written testimony. “If confirmed, I look forward to continuing to work with him and will seek his advice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k6RJ6H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think he has all the tools necessary to be a great NASA administrator.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8UgVqE"&gt;The Senate Commerce Committee is slated to vote on sending Nelson’s nomination to the Senate on April 28th, and it’s all but certain he’ll clinch confirmation.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Wednesday’s hearing was a “total love fest,” one NASA source said, echoing characterizations made on Twitter. “I think you are seeing exactly why Joe nominated him.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9umeY"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; Bridenstine said he expects that Nelson “will sail through the confirmation process,” given his support among Republican senators. “If there are members of the Senate who are considering not supporting him, I am very happy to say I think that’s a mistake. I think he has all the tools necessary to be a great NASA administrator,” Bridenstine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiSOzO"&gt;Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, who held up two of Biden’s nominees in March, and Rick Scott, who defeated Nelson in his 2018 reelection bid, made the bipartisan vibes clear at the end of the hearing. Scott said, “It’s nice to see a Floridian nominated for NASA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPjH8K"&gt;Cruz, smiling, said to Nelson: “There are not many Biden nominees about whom I am enthusiastic, and your nomination is a notable exception to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
