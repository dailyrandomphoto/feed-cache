    <title>What to expect from Tesla’s AI day event</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Recruitment, robots, and really powerful supercomputers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2ifpv6"&gt;It’s been nearly two years since Tesla’s first “Autonomy Day” event, at which CEO Elon Musk made numerous lofty predictions about the future of autonomous vehicles, including his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510828/tesla-elon-musk-autonomy-day-investor-comments-self-driving-cars-predictions"&gt;infamous claim&lt;/a&gt; that the company would have “one million robotaxis on the road” by the end of 2020. And now it’s time for &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux"&gt;Part Deux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7SMHR"&gt;This time, the event will be called “AI Day,” and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1420607874762518528"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;, the “sole goal” is to persuade experts in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to come work at Tesla. The company is known for its high rate of turnover, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-07/musk-lieutenant-guillen-leaves-tesla-as-chief-of-heavy-trucking?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;the latest being Jerome Guillen&lt;/a&gt;, a key executive who worked at Tesla for 10 years before recently stepping down. Attracting and retaining talent, especially top tier names, has proven to be a challenge for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ic6waS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The August 19th event is scheduled to start at 5PM PT / 8PM ET&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHNRmc"&gt;The August 19th event is scheduled to start at 5PM PT / 8PM ET at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California. According to an invitation &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/04/tesla-teases-future-products-using-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it will feature “a keynote by Elon, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in Model S Plaid, and more.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450840/tesla-battery-day-production-elon-musk-tabless-range-cathode-cobalt-plaid"&gt;Much like Battery Day&lt;/a&gt;, the event will be livestreamed on Tesla’s website, giving investors and the media, as well as the company’s many fans, an up-close look at what’s under development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc7usm"&gt;Musk and other top officials at the company are expected to provide updates on the rollout of Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta version 9, which started reaching more customers this summer. We may also get details about Tesla’s “Dojo” supercomputer, the training of its neural network, and the production of its FSD computer chips. And there will also be “an inside look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet,” the invitation says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW4HWQ"&gt;Let’s start with what we know and work our way toward the speculation of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VC5QUA"&gt;FSD rollout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cVDbfM"&gt;The big news out of Tesla’s first Autonomy Day was the introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet"&gt;the company’s first computer chip&lt;/a&gt;, a 260 square millimeter piece of silicon that Musk described as “the best chip in the world.” Originally, Musk had claimed that Tesla’s cars wouldn’t need any hardware updates, only software, on the road to full autonomy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685873/tesla-fsd-chip-upgrade-2019-install-hw2-full-self-driving"&gt;Turns out that wasn’t exactly the case&lt;/a&gt;; they would need this new chip — two of them, actually — in order to eventually drive themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d80z9A"&gt;A lot has happened between the 2019 event and now. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570081/tesla-fsd-v9-beta-autopilot-update"&gt;Tesla began shipping over-the-air software updates for FSD beta v9&lt;/a&gt;, its long-awaited, definitely not autonomous, but certainly advanced driver assist system. That means that Tesla owners who have purchased the FSD option (which now costs $10,000) would finally be able to use many of Autopilot’s advanced driver-assist features on local, non-highway streets, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18065540/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot-model-3-test-drive"&gt;Navigate on Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, Auto Lane Change, AutoPark, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891343/tesla-smart-summon-feature-videos-parking-accidents"&gt;Summon&lt;/a&gt;, and Traffic Light and Stop Control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zIdPyc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update doesn’t make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BsrciC"&gt;The update doesn’t make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous, nor will it launch “a million self-driving cars” on the road, as Musk predicted. Tesla owners who have Full Self-Driving still need to pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the steering wheel. Some don’t, which can have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;tragic consequences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6csG1l"&gt;Loved by fans, loathed by safety advocates, the FSD software has gotten Tesla in a lot of hot water recently. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;In recently publicized emails&lt;/a&gt; between Tesla and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, the company’s director of Autopilot software made it clear that Musk’s comments (including his tweets) do not reflect the reality of what Tesla’s vehicles can actually do. And now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;Autopilot is under investigation by federal regulators&lt;/a&gt; who want to know why Teslas with Autopilot keep crashing into emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpLvIs"&gt;Aside from the rollout of FSD beta v9, Tesla has also had to adjust to the global chip shortage. In a recent earnings call, Musk said that the company’s engineers had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrite some of their software&lt;/a&gt; in order to accommodate alternate computer chips. He also said that Tesla’s future growth will depend on a swift resolution to the global semiconductor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2EZhe"&gt;Tesla relies on chips to power everything from its airbags to the modules that control the vehicles’ seatbelts. It’s not clear whether the FSD chips, which are produced by Samsung, are being impacted by the shortage. Musk and his cohort may provide some insight into that during this week’s event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWm85o8-JY-dJMrM0QpMjdh9jRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16183257/Tesla_Full_Self_Driving_Computer_2040.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jP2vgN"&gt;Dojo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Yfq7Ok"&gt;Outside the car, Tesla uses a powerful supercomputer to train the AI software that then gets fed to its customers via over-the-air software updates. In 2019, Musk teased this “super powerful training computer,” which he referred to as “Dojo.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1hqtM"&gt;“Tesla is developing a [neural net] training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1294371531133317120?s=20"&gt;he later tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a beast!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ocJK9"&gt;He also hinted at Dojo’s computing power, claiming it was capable of an exaFLOP, or one quintillion (​​1018) floating-point operations per second. That is an incredible amount of power. “To match what a one exaFLOP computer system can do in just one second,” &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3535080/thousands-of-home-pcs-break-exaflop-barrier.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NetworkWorld&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; last year, “you’d have to perform one calculation every second for 31,688,765,000 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="07Ee3N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a beast!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lARL1H"&gt;By way of comparison, chipmaker AMD and computer builder Cray are currently working with the US Department of Energy on the design of the world’s fastest supercomputer, with 1.5 exaFLOPs of processing power. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535078/worlds-fastest-exascale-supercomputer-frontier-amd-cray-doe-oak-ridge-national-laboratory"&gt;Dubbed Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, AMD says the supercomputer will have as much processing power as the next 160 fastest supercomputers combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpODUy"&gt;When completed, Dojo is expected to be among the most powerful supercomputers on the planet. But rather than performing advanced calculations in areas like nuclear and climate research, Tesla’s supercomputer is running a neural net for the purposes of training its AI software to power self-driving cars. Ultimately, Musk has said Tesla will make Dojo available to other companies that want to use it to train their neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec2e9Y"&gt;Earlier this year, Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s head of AI, gave a presentation at the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, during which he offered more details about Dojo and its neural network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gucMW2"&gt;“For us, computer vision is the bread and butter of what we do and what enables Autopilot,” Karpathy said, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/21/tesla-unveils-new-supercomputer-train-self-driving-ai/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “And for that to work really well, we need to master the data from the fleet, and train massive neural nets and experiment a lot. So we invested a lot into the compute.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TMJpJp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tesla?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tesla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AI&lt;/a&gt; day&lt;br&gt;August 19, 2021 &lt;br&gt;Palo Alto, CA&lt;br&gt;5 p.m. PDT &lt;a href="https://t.co/4zsP9cVxh5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4zsP9cVxh5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dennis Hong (@DennisHongRobot) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DennisHongRobot/status/1422435800755568644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TkbTuv"&gt;Other robots?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iGj9zS"&gt;Earlier this month, Dennis Hong, founder of the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory at UCLA, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dennishongrobot/status/1422435800755568644?lang=en"&gt;tweeted a photo of a computer chip&lt;/a&gt; that many speculate is the in-house hardware used by Tesla’s Dojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l99jH4"&gt;But Hong is an interesting figure for other reasons, too. &lt;a href="https://www.romela.org/dr-dennis-hong/"&gt;He specializes in humanoid robots&lt;/a&gt; and was a participant in the DARPA Urban Challenge which kicked off the race for self-driving cars. (His team placed third.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImW2qi"&gt;Asked on Twitter whether his lab was working with Tesla, Hong posted some playful emojis but otherwise declined comment. We may learn more about how Hong’s work and Tesla’s pursuits intersect during AI Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oikRsx"&gt;Musk has been forthcoming about his desires for Tesla to become more than just a car company. “I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company,” he said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ECONOMY-INFRASTRUCTURE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4FrHLvAXCy_P6UnXfApMPK2y60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788752/1234659542.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bHB2BM"&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xHCy3M"&gt;A warning for anyone tuning in to the AI Day livestream: take Musk’s predictions about near-term accomplishments with a massive grain of salt. The things that will be discussed during this event are unlikely to have any measurable impact on the company’s business in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyEDBr"&gt;Self-driving cars are an incredibly difficult challenge. Even companies like Waymo that are perceived to have the best autonomous vehicle technology &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;are still struggling to get it right&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla is no different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMyvv0"&gt;“A key question for investors will be what the latest timeline is for achieving full autonomy,” Loup Funds managing partner Gene Munster &lt;a href="https://loupfunds.com/tesla-ai-day-to-give-glimpse-into-autonomy-other-applications/"&gt;said in a note&lt;/a&gt;. “Despite Elon’s ambitious goal of the end of this year, our best guess is that 2025 will be the first year of public availability of level 4 autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oWkfg3"&gt;The rest of 2021 is already jam packed for Tesla. The company needs to open factories in Texas and Germany. And it needs to tool up production for its hotly anticipated Cybertruck, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;which has been delayed until 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Full autonomy, such as it is, can wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYSujL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Lkug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZU538"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, the five-versus-five MOBA game that released in July for the Nintendo Switch, will debut on iOS and Android devices on September 22nd. The Pokémon Company shared today during a livestream that you can pre-register for the mobile game now on your respective devices (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1512321575"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;). You’ll be notified when it’s officially available to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJqIX3"&gt;Whether you play &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; on mobile or a Nintendo Switch, the game will offer cross-platform play to broaden who you can play alongside or against. By linking your account on both the Switch version and the mobile game, you’ll be able to have cross-progression, which will allow you to play the game with your saved data and characters on whichever device is more convenient. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ special edition Zephyrus G14 comes with its own DJ deck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition keyboard seen from above angled to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9K39qB4ndmZNzeimFKfeddqhow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741204/bfarsace_210817_4714_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you spot the Alan Walker logo?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2faU2"&gt;If there’s one company I trust to do a good job with utterly ridiculous computer ideas, it’s Asus. Last fall, the company worked with cyberpunky fashion designer Acronym to make possibly the weirdest-looking gaming laptop I’ve ever seen (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21432977/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-acronym-amd-ryzen-9-4900hs-nvidia-rtx-2060"&gt;ZPHYRS G14 ACRNM&lt;/a&gt;). This year, it’s partnered with popular DJ Alan Walker to create a less avant-garde, more musical version of the same device. This is the Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition, a laptop for gamers, DJs, and (ideally) gamer DJs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIVvhZ"&gt;The insides of this laptop are nothing ROG fans haven’t seen before. There’s only one configuration, selling for $1,999.99, which includes an AMD Ryzen 5900HS processor and a low-end GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, as well as a QHD 120Hz screen, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. So, just to be clear, this isn’t really a sensible purchase unless you’re an Alan Walker superfan, because &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM300000011/A50184-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-AniMe-Matrix-Ultra-Slim-Gaming-Laptop%2C-14%E2%80%9D-120Hz-PANTONE-Validated-QHD-Display%2C-GeForce-RTX-3060%2C-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HS%2C-32GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-SSD%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-Windows-10-Pro%2C-GA401QM-XS98Q-WH"&gt;that same price&lt;/a&gt; can get you a non-Walker G14 with a more powerful RTX 3060 GPU, as well as 32GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch seen from the front, open. The screen displays Alan Walker hovering on a red and blue background, conjuring lights of each color with his hands. To its left is its box, with 11 DJ buttons and ROG X ALAN WALKER printed on the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3_PYRkWK0ugBoz-mngQOTxcW0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788137/bfarsace_210817_4714_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, those buttons actually work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dx3nzO"&gt;Still, it’s a pretty cool device. The lid is laced with a reflective belt commanding passersby to “JOIN THE REPUBLIC” and “JOIN THE WALKERS.” Alan Walker’s logo — resembling an A superimposed over a W — is printed in various places, including the A and W keys as well as on the nameplate. There’s a diagonal line print on the touchpad meant to resemble music equalizer patterns, and there are splashes of bright blue — Walker’s favorite color — across the keyboard as well. It’s not an obnoxious aesthetic, like these special editions sometimes have — it looks more like a standard G14 with some colorful tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlXfGf"&gt;Walker says the design reflects the look he’d want his personal device to have. “They approached me and asked, what are your expectations for the laptop, what do you look for in a laptop if you were to pick one yourself?” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview. “It was a lot of back and forth — like, a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch, facing away from the camera, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2iW5dnLAmRyPm_0JkAphCBV-FWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788134/bfarsace_210817_4714_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JOIN THE REPUBLIC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch seen from the front, open. The screen displays Alan Walker hovering on a red and blue background, conjuring lights of each color with his hands." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pybxRhdumQhEIof99XaMe6oL09A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788138/bfarsace_210817_4714_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JOIN THE WALKERS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJjKIG"&gt;The other cool thing is that the packaging this G14 comes in becomes a DJ deck when connected to the laptop via USB-C. It’s not the most high-tech affair — if you lift up the paper floor, you’ll see a nest of wires taped to the bottom of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6FmJn"&gt;“That’s one of those crazy ideas where we ended up debating, would this be possible?” Walker said of the DJ box. “Asus is like ‘Yeah, cool, we can maybe think about something, figure something out,’ and then they came back with a box.” He added, “It’s so weird how it even works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUYwYy"&gt;I expected this to be complicated to set up for a non-DJ like myself, but it was a breeze. Plug the box into the G14, and a preloaded software called ROG Remix opens automatically. You can play a song within that program, and then tweak it by pressing various buttons on the box. There are buttons for things like speed, start / stop, and a few basic effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left palm rest of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSZEWOkdWXPjCDZDmClvmddk7hE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788135/bfarsace_210817_4714_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same old chips, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DacaWjLE2f5r-JK31Tiw0YSKMCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788136/bfarsace_210817_4714_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same old ports as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GUvJmF"&gt;This was — caveating, again, that I’m not a DJ — a lot of fun. The buttons all worked, and the effects sounded very cool to my untrained ears. It seems like something you could easily use at a party, especially since the G14’s speakers are fantastic. The music was crackling a bit at the beginning, but that seemed to sort itself out after a few tracks. Mostly, I’m impressed that this is all coming out of a plastic box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ie7b9y"&gt;Walker agrees that his G14 is a better purchase for people like me than it would be for actual DJs. “It’s not necessarily the number-one gadget to get if you want to start with DJing, but it’s definitely a cool starting point,” says Walker. “I hope that people will use it to be creative and play around with music.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pljb8X"&gt;He does, however, expect that he’ll use the G14 on his next tour. “It’s got everything that I need, basically, to work and prepare for my shows,” Walker says. “I can easily foresee myself using it every day.” He says he might use it to plan his set lists prior to performances, and to work on the visuals as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1hqpo"&gt;He might also use it for some gaming in his spare time. “Lately I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “Also some &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBtDDC"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition is available now for $1,999.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch, seen from the front, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O12jEu74BpMGMc1l5vW7K2giIpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788131/bfarsace_210817_4714_0001.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl look adorable in new trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_LxmO8TDsz499hsQCfMUe32BiM=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741194/Switch_PokemonBrilliantDiamondandPokemonShiningPearl_Screenshot__6_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7bHUCT"&gt;At a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-focused livestream, Nintendo revealed a trailer showing off the absolutely adorable new look for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl. &lt;/em&gt;The clip gave a good overview of the world itself, along with some of the enhanced elements, like what sounds like a nice orchestral mix for the score. You can also decorate pokéballs with stickers now, and — finally — actually change your outfit in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8ojGW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl&lt;/em&gt; are remakes of the 2006 Nintendo DS titles &lt;em&gt;Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;. The new versions feature a much-changed chibi art style, along with “some of the player-friendly features of modern &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games,” according to Nintendo. That includes a fan-favorite feature where a pokémon can follow you as you explore the world. Aside from that, they’re expected to feature the same story and world as the originals. The remakes were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;originally announced in February&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454614/pokemon-legends-arceus-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;an open-world prequel that’s launching next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zjapb"&gt;It’s a bit of a busy time for the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise at the moment. In addition to the new games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405886/new-pokemon-snap-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just received a major update, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; continues to chug along (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605874/pokemon-go-pokestop-distance-halved-us-new-zealand"&gt;albeit with some controversy&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590249/pokemon-unite-nintendo-switch-hands-on-esports"&gt;the competitive strategy game &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently debuted on the Switch, with a mobile version expected next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQJdxE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl &lt;/em&gt;are expected to launch on November 19th. On November 5th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1427983009345523720"&gt;a special edition Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; is launching with &lt;em&gt;Pearl / Diamond&lt;/em&gt; visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds 2 are already $25 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5QIxc9OgV4OjU2cgGsXnxFm2faM=/0x162:2040x1522/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741143/02_02_Berry_Family_01_galaxybuds2_family_graphite_white_olive_lavender_H.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uAV6gh"&gt;Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds 2 wireless earbuds last week, so it’s a surprise that Woot is already offering a sizable discount on them. Normally priced at $150, you can snag a &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;set in the graphite, white, lavender, or olive colorways for $125&lt;/a&gt;. In case you were worried there might be a catch — well, there is one. These don’t come with a Samsung warranty. Instead, you’ll get a 90-day warranty through Woot against hardware defects. If that’s not a deal-breaker for you, this could be a deal that’s worth jumping on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUjlmc"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch recently reviewed them, and compared to the first-gen Galaxy Buds, these have added active noise cancellation. He says that the areas where Samsung made the biggest improvements, though, are with the design and fit. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the whole review right here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1NbJwf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 seen from above and to the right. A mug sits to its left on the desk, a notebook to its right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDpb0N42lMwZ8aew_HQ6-XzCB5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22333695/akrales_210226_4438_0100.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WJBEXM"&gt;Another great Samsung deal happening today is on the Chromebook 2 at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749436581682277739" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The vibrant fiesta red-colored model&lt;/a&gt; with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of eMMC storage, and a 13.3-inch QLED FHD display is $499, down from $699. That’s still pricey for a Chromebook, but this one has the fit and finish of high-end laptops for a more reasonable price. Compared to the first-gen Samsung Chromebook, the battery life in this model is better, and it has a 10th Gen Intel Core i3-10110U processor that should be sufficient for casual browsing and schoolwork. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review right here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E4cag9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10698797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nG8Tew"&gt;If you have a Micro Center store near you in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/632265/apple-airpods-max-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-silver" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can snag a set of Apple AirPods Max for $450&lt;/a&gt;, which is $100 off the regular cost. This is close to the lowest price that we’ve seen yet for these high-end noise-canceling headphones, but you’ll need to go in to pick them up. Micro Center only ships select products, and this unfortunately isn’t one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZZliQL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yaPPP"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Dot smart speaker that looks like a little ball is cheaper than usual. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-speaker-Charcoal-Sengled-Bluetooth/dp/B08YT2N5SX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $35 instead of $50&lt;/a&gt; at both Amazon and Best Buy, but what makes this deal worth sharing is that it comes with a complimentary Sengled smart bulb. If you want to dabble in the world of smart lightbulbs (it’s awesome), check out this affordable bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SlekJm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Surface Mobile Mouse" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_k0ySt0_UBjtVLMIVi_NaZsUYFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789769/surfacemouse.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GaCv5K"&gt;Wrapping up for today, Best Buy is offering a nice deal on Microsoft’s Surface Mobile Mouse that connects via Bluetooth and requires two AAA batteries. Normally $30 each, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749438288218003138" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get two of these mice for the price of one&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you like two of the four colors available in this deal, you should go ahead and get both. I’ve only briefly tested this model, but it seems lacking for those who want a more ergonomic design. On the other hand, its low-profile build might be exactly what some people are after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yg1TLX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="W0GNiU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest is adding search filters for different hair textures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a Pinterest search for “summer hairstyles” showing filter options for protective, coily, curly, wavy, straight, and shave/ bald. Protective is selected, showing various pins of people with braids and twists. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhctYSvXiaor1l41pZ5CgEO_-oQ=/5x0:4289x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741089/Hair_Pattern_Desktop_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinterest’s new hair pattern search feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pinterest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqWv7P"&gt;Pinterest is launching a search tool to help people narrow their hair inspiration searches by hair pattern. When users search for hairstyles, new filter options — for coily, curly, wavy, and straight textures, as well as shaved / bald and protective styles — will appear under the search bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkFGFb"&gt;The filters should be particularly useful for people of color looking for styles tailored to their hair textures, and Pinterest says they were created with Black, brown, and Latinx people in mind. “Just the simple idea that I don’t have to work twice as hard to find a hairstyle because of my hair type is a game changer,” says Naeemah LaFond, an editorial hair stylist and global artistic director of the Amika hair care brand, who advised Pinterest during the feature’s development. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gif showing “summer hairstyles” being typed into Pinterest search and bringing up different pins under the protective and coily filters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWjlvJ-5kDSkIVoUtHrXmiD2IxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787824/Hair_Pattern_Search_Mobile_GIF.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I1wF90"&gt;The new feature builds on Pinterest’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17286898/pinterest-skin-tone-search-filter-results-feature-update"&gt;skin tone search filters&lt;/a&gt;, which were introduced in 2018. To make those filters, Pinterest engineers started with data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131260/loreal-modiface-acquire-makeup-ar-try-on"&gt;ModiFace’s&lt;/a&gt; AI library, adjusting the algorithm from there to improve things like its ability to properly categorize skin tones in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PPAQp"&gt;Pinterest says the hair pattern feature uses “computer vision-powered object detection” to determine which hair types are shown in hairstyle pins. According to Pinterest, its algorithm has detected hair patterns in over 500 million images on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1zrR9"&gt;Hair pattern search will be rolling out across desktop, iOS, and Android apps over the coming weeks, says Pinterest. The filters will be available in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand first, before expanding to other countries in the coming months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZrEkU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X9yJTCPgWCLBGbt4zaCWTaDDiAA=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740963/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJvM5T"&gt;Microsoft’s upcoming release of Windows 11 will make it even harder to switch default browsers and ignores browser defaults in new areas of the operating system. While Microsoft is making many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;positive changes to the Windows 11 UI&lt;/a&gt;, the default apps experience is a step back and browser competitors like Mozilla, Opera, and Vivaldi are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5VGJG"&gt;In Windows 11, Microsoft has changed the way you set default apps. Like Windows 10, there’s a prompt that appears when you install a new browser and open a web link for the first time. It’s the only opportunity to easily switch browsers, though. Unless you tick “always use this app,” the default will never be changed. It’s incredibly easy to forget to toggle the “always use this app” option, and simply launch the browser you want from this prompt and never see this default choice again when you click web links.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ozOugHeiaS-a-iyWJHg8NTvMqQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789636/2EEreJo.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The default app prompt in Windows 11 that you’ll only see once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3RAhqP"&gt;If you do forget to set your default browser at first launch, the experience for switching defaults is now very confusing compared to Windows 10. Chrome and many other rival browsers will often prompt users to set them as default and will throw Windows users into the default apps part of settings to enable this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPQ2rC"&gt;Microsoft has changed the way default apps are assigned in Windows 11, which means you now have to set defaults by file or link type instead of a single switch. In the case of Chrome, that means changing the default file type for HTM, HTML, PDF, SHTML, SVG, WEBP, XHT, XHTML, FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbgJ5t"&gt;It’s an unnecessarily long process compared to Windows 10, which allows you to quickly and easily switch default email, maps, music, photos, videos, and web browser apps. Competitors aren’t impressed with Microsoft’s changes to Windows 11 here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxrlkuKgamqp7lVFeUt-fogWIG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789637/nBhaqDv.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 will also prompt you to reconsider switching away from Edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P2872s"&gt;“We have been increasingly worried about the trend on Windows,” says Selena Deckelmann, senior vice president of Firefox, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Since Windows 10, users have had to take additional and unnecessary steps to set and retain their default browser settings. These barriers are confusing at best and seem designed to undermine a user’s choice for a non-Microsoft browser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAiJM9"&gt;Mozilla isn’t alone in its concerns, which it has been &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/an-open-letter-to-microsofts-ceo-dont-roll-back-the-clock-on-choice-and-control/"&gt;highlighting for years&lt;/a&gt;. “Microsoft has a history of doing this, and it seems they are getting progressively worse,” says a Vivaldi spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “With every new version of Windows, it is getting harder [to change defaults]. They understand that the only way they can get people to use their browsers is to lock them in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB869M"&gt;Opera, another rival to Microsoft Edge, is also unimpressed with Microsoft’s changes to Windows 11 default apps. “It’s very unfortunate when a platform vendor is obscurifying a common use case to improve the standing of their own product,” says Krystian Kolondra, Opera’s head of browsers in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We would like to encourage all platform vendors to respect user choice and allow competition on their platforms. Taking away user choice is a step backwards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGNnk3"&gt;We also reached out to Google to comment on Microsoft’s changes to Edge, but the company did not respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lw_-QJBtN2ck0NgMlDKHaSs6v-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789643/windows11defaultapps.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to change default apps on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zR4z19"&gt;Default app choices aren’t the only issues affecting browsers in Windows 11, either. Microsoft has been ignoring default browser choices in its search experience in Windows 10, and the company introduced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397237/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature-available-now"&gt;taskbar widget&lt;/a&gt; that also ignored a default browser and forced users into Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sHPrP"&gt;Windows 11 continues this trend, with search still forcing users into Edge, and now a new dedicated widgets area that also ignores the default browser setting. “It appears that Windows 11 widgets will ignore a user’s default browser choice and open Microsoft Edge for the content instead,” says a Brave spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Brave puts users first and we condemn this Windows 11 approach, because the choice of a default browser has many implications for individuals and their privacy. Users should be free to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXvmz2"&gt;It’s not clear yet whether Windows 11 will also continue Microsoft’s trend of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;forcing Edge onto people&lt;/a&gt; through Windows Updates, with regular prompts to switch. It all seems rather unnecessary, as the Chromium-based version of Edge is a great browser that many probably won’t need or want to switch away from in the future anyway. Microsoft wouldn’t be happy if Google or Apple ignored browser defaults like this with iOS or Android, so this blatant disregard is troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5undw1yQ6lvAoOwgffN-E42WZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679283/windows11stock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 widgets also ignore browser defaults.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CrVDvF"&gt;Microsoft justifies these changes as allowing Windows users to have more control over default apps. “With Windows 11, we are implementing customer feedback to customize and control defaults at a more granular level, eliminating app categories and elevating all apps to the forefront of the defaults experience,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As evidenced by this change, we’re constantly listening and learning, and welcome customer feedback that helps shape Windows. Windows 11 will continue to evolve over time; if we learn from user experience that there are ways to make improvements, we will do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewNeFy"&gt;It’s not long until Windows 11 ships, and competitors are very clear these changes aren’t welcome. Is Microsoft really listening, though? We’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;find out in a couple of months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us devs aren’t happy with Fortnite’s blatant copying</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cC7cAEG-jotqQqw8tibIDSu9-0s=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740795/amongus.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s2Vhc9"&gt;Epic Games launched &lt;em&gt;Fortnite: Impostors &lt;/em&gt;yesterday, a new mode that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;copies the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; game mechanics&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, the multiplayer game that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;soared in popularity&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the pandemic, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456688/among-us-pc-free-epic-games-store"&gt;free on the Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt; recently, Epic didn’t collaborate with Innersloth, the studio that created &lt;em&gt;Among Us, &lt;/em&gt;for the new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; mode. The developers behind &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; are clearly surprised and unhappy that Epic has copied their game so blatantly, with social deduction gameplay and a very similar map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k1YZa"&gt;“It would’ve been really, really cool to collab,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheVTran/status/1427725915870699521"&gt;said Victoria Tran&lt;/a&gt;, Innersloth community director. “Like game mechanics, fine, those shouldn’t be gatekept, but at the very least even different themes or terminology makes things more interesting?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yvFeCQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;     &lt;a href="https://t.co/wTESWQHJZD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wTESWQHJZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gary Porter (@supergarydeluxe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supergarydeluxe/status/1427717779914989569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RNNkxd"&gt;Gary Porter, a developer for &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, also pointed out the similarities between the map that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; uses and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s okay though they flipped electrical and medbay and connected security to the cafeteria,” joked Porter on Twitter. “I wasn’t even around for the development of Skeld [the first &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; map] and I’m still kind of offended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YYIpg"&gt;Calum Underwood, another developer on &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, tweeted and deleted what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevRelCallum/status/1427787105674145792"&gt;he referred to&lt;/a&gt; as “spicy tweets,” before then &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevRelCallum/status/1427756105380339721"&gt;inviting other game makers&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate with &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;instead. &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/among-us-devs-arent-feeling-fortnite-s-new-impostors-1847505281"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku &lt;/em&gt;also spotted&lt;/a&gt; that Adriel Wallick, a programmer at Innersloth, also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MsMinotaur/status/1427717612780367877"&gt;shared a comic&lt;/a&gt; about the theft of art online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LRy0ls"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We didn't patent the Among Us mechanics. I don't think that leads to a healthy game industry. Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?&lt;/p&gt;— Puff (@PuffballsUnited) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PuffballsUnited/status/1427781760692068355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b8p530"&gt;Innersloth co-founder, Marcus Bromander, said the company didn’t patent Among Us mechanics as “I don’t think that leads to a healthy game industry.” Instead, Bromander expected Epic to put more effort into their own spin on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqBUN0"&gt;Epic’s Impostors mode in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has obviously taken the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; team by surprise, even if it’s only a temporary mode in the game. The not-so-subtle hints at copying and art theft here come after small creators have accused Epic of stealing their work in the past. Epic has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184401/epic-games-fortnite-dance-emote-legal-lawsuit-2-milly-carlton-floss"&gt;years of legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; related to emotes that the company copied from children and independent artists without paying for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfhALd"&gt;Epic’s choice to copy &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; also comes just months after the company’s bitter legal battle with Apple. It’s a legal fight that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369622/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ban-basic-freedoms-developers"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has described&lt;/a&gt; as about “basic freedoms of all consumers and developers.” It’s not a great look if Epic is fighting for small developers in one sense, but undermining them elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft Singapore probed by national watchdog after toxic workplace allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49TwPRW63wjnIHXTfyRD6xY34z4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740738/acastro_190528_1777_ubisoft_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qhJDpT"&gt;Ubisoft Singapore, the lead studio on &lt;em&gt;Skull &amp;amp; Bones&lt;/em&gt; and co-developer of &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, is being investigated by a national employment watchdog over allegations of misconduct at the studio. Singaporean newspaper &lt;a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/ubisoft-spore-under-probe-over-workplace-complaints"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the country’s Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) began its investigation after receiving anonymous feedback about conditions at the studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNl2Pe"&gt;The probe follows a wide-ranging &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-stalled-reckoning-at-an-assassins-creed-co-d-1847336158"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last month based on conversations with over 20 current and former employees about the studio’s allegedly toxic workplace environment. Sources said female employees were sometimes subjected to unwanted physical contact, and that subsequent investigations from HR would drag on for months and result in minor penalties. The studio is also alleged to suffer from racial disparities, with local employees unable to progress past a so-called “French ceiling” at the Paris-headquartered company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yA0Ntr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of many Ubisoft studios where misconduct has been reported&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZmiYn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that such investigations usually involve interviews with affected parties, and can result in civic or criminal sanctions. Civil sanctions may include blocking the studio from applying for new work passes for foreign employees, while more serious infractions can lead to a criminal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNeU5C"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Ubisoft said it was aware that feedback had been sent to the TAFEP, but said it couldn’t comment on the probe while discussions were still ongoing. “Every Ubisoft studio, including Ubisoft Singapore, strives to create and foster a culture that team members and partners can be proud of,” the company said. “We do not and will not tolerate discrimination or abuse. We celebrate our international culture and work to ensure our teams are deeply integrated into their respective local communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEbY9E"&gt;In response to last month’s report from &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;, the company said 40 percent of expert and senior expert roles at Ubisoft Singapore are filled by Singaporeans or permanent residents. “Our objective is to continue to increase Singaporean leadership through various programs including a dedicated management learning path to accelerate the development of new leaders,” it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEsJeF"&gt;In an August 6th press conference, Ubisoft Singapore’s managing director Darryl Long, who  took over leadership of the studio said that the company “[needs] to start to change the way we are perceived and the way we act internally as well,” &lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKYoCu"&gt;The allegations of misconduct at Ubisoft Singapore have taken place against a backdrop of widespread reports of toxicity across Ubisoft as a whole. An anonymous survey of nearly 14,000 employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499334/ubisoft-employees-workplace-misconduct-ceo-yves-guillemot-response"&gt;published in October&lt;/a&gt; revealed that as many as a quarter of them have seen or experienced workplace misconduct, with 20 percent saying they didn’t feel “fully respected or safe in the work environment.” However, despite several high profile employees being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368787/ubisoft-fires-former-assassins-creed-valhalla-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-allegations-misconduct"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353197/ubisoft-fires-tommy-francois-allegations-sexual-harassment"&gt;the company&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Yves Guillemot has said that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430738/ubisoft-black-lives-matter-harassment-diversity-inclusion"&gt;real change will take time.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6eQD5"&gt;Meanwhile, competitor Activision Blizzard is currently embroiled in a sexual harassment controversy of its own, having been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;recently sued by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms it’s removing ads from its stock apps later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI on the Galaxy S21 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIC6twemoCU-toVQEoHayEe1l_k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740638/vpavic_210119_4377_0157.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $1,199 Galaxy S21 Ultra, which showed ads in its default apps.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f39xKq"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that it will stop showing ads in default apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme. It follows comments made by its mobile chief TM Roh in an internal town hall meeting &lt;a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210817140800017"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Samsung has made a decision to cease the advertisement on proprietary apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme,” the company said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “The update will be ready by later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ObzCj"&gt;“Our priority is to deliver innovative mobile experiences for our consumers based on their needs and wants,” the company said. “We value feedback from our users and continue our commitment to provide them with the best possible experience from our Galaxy products and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6jD8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Samsung has made a decision to cease the advertisement on proprietary apps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoQ1j"&gt;In our review of this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, we said it was unforgivable that Samsung would choose to show the “kind of ad that’s normally at the bottom of a crappy, overloaded website” in its default weather app. Yes, it’s been possible to dodge or disable these ads and switch to non-Samsung versions of each app, but you shouldn’t be expected to have to do that after spending $1,199 on a flagship smartphone. They’re part of the reason why Samsung’s otherwise clean One UI software has started to feel messy over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2xeRB"&gt;Samsung did not share a specific date for when the ads would be removed from its software, but &lt;em&gt;Yonhap &lt;/em&gt;previously reported that the change will be made via a forthcoming One UI software update. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/samsung-ads-removal-report/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has published&lt;/a&gt; a collection of screenshots if you want to see just how bad Samsung’s apps currently look.&lt;/p&gt;
