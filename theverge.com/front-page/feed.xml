    <title>Huawei Mate X2 teaser hints at new folding screen design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Opn_LzVdsY-ozdAuEUQo8VEKXec=/0x0:1035x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68835165/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wb4L6R"&gt;Huawei has posted another teaser for its upcoming Mate X2 folding phone &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K2tgLpqKW?from=page_1006061839167003_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1613632260891"&gt;on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, offering the strongest hint yet that it’ll move away from the original Mate X’s design. The first Mate X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;refreshed in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, had a single large screen that folded in half so that the display was on the outside of the device. The follow-up phone, however, looks like it’ll fold the other way, more like Samsung’s Galaxy Folds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvXmab"&gt;Making reference to a new design for the Mate X2, the teaser image shows the phone from the side open at an angle, with a glow on the inside of the hinge. The picture is also a reference to the timing of the event, which will take place at 8PM China time (7AM ET) on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mMWdo"&gt;Here’s the full teaser image:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rp9DtGl3_dMvfOUHNHq15oYYg_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311866/0020sXlVgy1gnrgbvs0qrj60u01hck6502_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpwj9e"&gt;The announcement will coincide with Mobile World Congress Shanghai next week, which has swapped its traditional summer slot with the larger Barcelona event. As of now, the GSM Association still plans for MWC Barcelona to take place in person from June 28th, but  those plans could of course change depending on the pandemic situation, and phone companies are likely to have planned new device launches for around February and March as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s One UI 3.1 update brings some S21 camera features to last year’s flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S20" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLpsb-IWvpqOFNhWf4n8j5FV0xk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68834359/bking_200303_3928_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3yWys"&gt;Samsung has announced that its &lt;a href="https://smsng.news/2ZmI4EW"&gt;latest One UI 3.1 software update&lt;/a&gt; is rolling out to some of its older phones. The update will trickle down some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 lineup’s&lt;/a&gt; newer software features to last year’s Samsung flagships, including the Galaxy S20, Galaxy Note 20, Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Z Flip phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZRYHR"&gt;Most of the new features are focused on bringing some of the software enhancements that Samsung debuted for the camera on the S21 lineup back down to its older devices. Those include the “enhanced single take” option that automatically captures and generates a variety of still images and videos with just one click, the smart object eraser tool for quickly removing unwanted parts of your photos, and the option to use both your phone and a separate Bluetooth microphone to record audio simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLI8uJ4Oj5nqsV1hhBokHiPwmX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311071/One_UI_3.1_Update_Object_eraser.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung’s object eraser feature&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jTrQvk"&gt;The update brings the S20 / S20 Plus and S21 / S21 Plus models — which already shared virtually identical camera hardware — even closer together in terms of overall functionality, although there are still some features that remain exclusive to the newer device, like the director view feature for easily previewing and switching between different lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbDE5o"&gt;Also being added to the 2020 devices is Samsung’s “Eye Comfort Shield,” which automatically adjusts the blue light output on the phones based on the time of day. There’s also Private Share, Samsung’s blockchain-based encryption option for more securely sending files and photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8cXz"&gt;The One UI 3.1 update will begin rolling out tonight “in select regions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s campaign app was suspended from the Google Play Store because it didn’t work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-TRUMP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1xsOYP1nzIkQYaEJqthMVeX1uw=/16x0:2716x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833887/1221046780.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjT9Ft"&gt;Google removed former president Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign app from Google’s Play Store earlier Wednesday. It wasn’t removed for any of the many other reasons that Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;has been removed from the world’s largest platforms&lt;/a&gt;, but rather because it just didn't work, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/17/donald-trumps-official-app-has-been-suspended-from-the-google-play-store-no-longer-works/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUtFBm"&gt;Prior to its suspension, the app provided campaign news, an event schedule, and ways to donate to the campaign, but at some point, it stopped working, prompting Google to take it down. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that the app was non-functional before Google removed it. When &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; tested the app, it was “unable to load content, reporting a network error or simply spinning a loading ‘T’ circle endlessly.” The iOS version of the app is still on the Apple App Store and still working, however.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yNxIo_sRyDHGT9dXb3-OqPbV0MU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311132/chrome_2021_02_17_14_30_25.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Official Trump 2020 app page in the Play Store, prior to its removal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ILMd9j"&gt;It might not be surprising, but apps do need to maintain “minimum functionality” as part of  of the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9898783#zippy=%2Cexamples-of-common-violations"&gt;Play Store’s policies&lt;/a&gt;, which means they should both load and be responsive. Google provided a statement to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; about why it removed the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kz6oc1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trump 2020 campaign app recently stopped working and we reached out to the developer multiple times in an attempt to get them to address the issue. People expect that apps downloaded from Google Play provide a minimum level of functionality and our policy is to remove non-working apps from the store if they are not fixed.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="x7nHGL"&gt;While there could be a desire to connect the app’s removal to larger political motives like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22223972/trump-impeached-house-senate-trial-former-president"&gt;Trump’s second impeachment&lt;/a&gt; or even earlier instances of the former President getting removed from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook, Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218757/youtube-trump-account-video-deleted-uploads-suspension-indefinite"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, this is simple app store moderation at work: when an app doesn’t function and the developers don’t update, it gets removed until further notice. Since the 2020 campaign is over, don’t expect the app to get updated — at least until 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HV8vIq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome OS now has a built-in screen recorder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxxAdeuDg-lwcLzWTy5IhVRE7GM=/297x0:1284x658/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833756/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CotvHx"&gt;Google has announced that a built-in screen recorder is coming to Chrome OS in March. Google hopes the tool will make it easier for students and teachers to record virtual lessons. “Teachers have long recorded lessons to help students do homework and study for tests, but in the past year it’s become downright critical for virtual learning,” reads Google’s &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/learning-with-google-chromebook/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyI5t"&gt;It looks pretty simple. Once you’ve pressed the appropriate button on your Chromebook, you’ll see a countdown in the center of your screen. While your Chromebook is recording, a red circle will appear on the right side of the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJZ6cvTTrahRisjg1GPrW7cvG0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311214/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fFMCfA"&gt;A few other tools for Chromebook learners are in the works as well, and some have already arrived. Chrome OS’s screen reader, ChromeVox, has some new features: The voice now changes based on the language of the text it’s reading, and you can now search its menus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emt0PZ"&gt;Additionally, parents can now use &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9900467?hl=en"&gt;Family Link&lt;/a&gt; (Google’s parental-control app) to manage their children’s school accounts in addition to their personal accounts. This means screen-time limits, bedtimes, and other restrictions parents place on their children’s personal accounts can apply to their school accounts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuWhvc"&gt;On the hardware side, Google has announced that it’s launching over 40 new Chromebooks this year. It claims every model is “equipped to deliver exceptional Google Meet and Zoom experiences”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wot6kp"&gt;To help schools navigate the new releases, the company has put out &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15MBdfJTqKZaqymPKYV8JMBxneqshFT7OGpolxFbHiL8/edit#slide=id.gb78f293965_1_464"&gt;a list of available Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt;, which includes configurations from Samsung, Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Acer, and tips for selecting the right one. The company recommends a number of basic models, such as Acer’s Chromebook Spin 511 and Lenovo’s 300e, as well as fancier devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s top Chromebook pick) and Samsung’s $1,000 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOC9pL"&gt;A number of these units include LTE connectivity — Google is referring to these as “Always Connected” devices, and emphasizes their importance for students with limited internet access (though buying a device with LTE can bump the price up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RcnI2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Equipped to deliver exceptional Google Meet and Zoom experiences”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOZ79i"&gt;Chromebooks are big sellers in the education market, due in part to their affordability and districts’ widespread use of Google Classroom, Google’s online education portal. 2020 was the Chromebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256873/chromebook-best-year-ever-double-yearly-sales"&gt;best year ever&lt;/a&gt;, due largely to increased demand from schools providing at-home instruction for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gksHUR"&gt;Google has been building out its services for remote school and meetings since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;early months of remote schooling&lt;/a&gt;, Google made Meet meetings with up to 100 participants available to anyone with a Google account. It’s added a number of features to Meet as well, in an effort to keep up with large competitors Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The company has rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21543261/google-meet-custom-backgrounds-video-calls-zoom"&gt;custom backgrounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/27/21305434/google-meet-background-blur-captioning-video-microsoft-teams-zoom"&gt;blur effects&lt;/a&gt;, real-time captioning, low-light mode, and hand-raising in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 20 biggest announcements from today’s Nintendo Direct </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-iWGptzv1FpWw4OQqTGzOn3AVXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833726/acastro_190530_1777_switch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRFJUh"&gt;For the first time in over a year, Nintendo hosted a full-fledged Direct presentation. The latest presentation was focused mostly on games slated to hit Nintendo’s hybrid gaming console, the Switch, sometime during the first half of 2021, though there were a few announcements for games that will hit later than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94ET2C"&gt;The nearly hour-long event included a slew of titles slated to hit the Switch before the year is half over, including ports for indie games such as &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; and new installments in franchises like &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Splatoon&lt;/em&gt;. Here are the biggest news announcements and trailers from today’s Nintendo Direct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9UBAd2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GUYDXVDLmns?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NESyIL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288279/splatoon-3-nintendo-switch-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3 inks its way onto Nintendo Switch in 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PByR6X"&gt;The third installment in the &lt;em&gt;Splatoon &lt;/em&gt;franchise is slated to launch in 2022. Not much is known about the game, aside from a new desert locale, but game appears to feature the same paint-shooting action from previous entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tBYc9v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X27t1VEU4d0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="POcoAs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD slashes onto Nintendo Switch July 16th &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylym4X"&gt;Nintendo announced &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, &lt;/em&gt;a re-release of the 2011 Wii U exclusive. The game will launch alongside a new pair of &lt;em&gt;Zelda-&lt;/em&gt;themed Joy-Cons. Nintendo also said it would share more information about the sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;later this year&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdsYim"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aucAzFWpvMc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KSVWDQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288222/mario-golf-super-rush-nintendo-release-date-june-25"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Golf Super Rush is the latest installment in the Mario Golf Series and it arrives June 25th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lJrJl1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Golf Super Rush&lt;/em&gt; is the first &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf&lt;/em&gt; title for Nintendo’s hybrid console. The game will feature motion controls, new modes, and a story campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Australian media ban is taking down official government pages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2AjOXW13-ZnPJP5BnBLm7czXXbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833668/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AJ1zNQ"&gt;The Facebook pages of many Australian government agencies seem to have been caught up in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;social media network’s ban on news posts by users and media organizations in the country&lt;/a&gt;. Users on Twitter have reported that the pages of agencies like the Bureau of Meteorology, Department of Fire and Emergency Services Western Australia, and Queensland Health have no posts available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzMPDq"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff in the US tried to access the pages, some saw them as having no posts. Other &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers saw posts appearing as normal, however, though were often viewing pages without logging into Facebook. Still, the volume of Twitter concerns makes it clear that, for at least some users, posts from those pages are inaccessible. It’s unclear whether the different results were the result of a ban still rolling out or Facebook retracting the enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03rB8h"&gt;Crucially, none of the listed Facebook accounts are Australian media organizations, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;which are not allowed to post at all&lt;/a&gt;, and thus should not be subject to the ban. Instead, the accounts are either government agencies or landing pages for public service announcements and warnings. In some cases, removing the posts could post a significant risk to the public, as some of the departments use Facebook as a method to warn of imminent risks to public health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmUBEu"&gt;When reached for comment, Facebook said the ban shouldn’t impact government pages, but acknowledged there was some confusion in how far the restriction would reach. “As the law does not provide a clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted,” a Facebook representative said. “However, we will reverse any Pages that are inadvertently impacted.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas has work to do to avoid another energy crisis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Winter Storm Uri Brings Ice And Snow Across Widespread Parts Of The Nation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AeiVe86f1ZVDv88bXMuQYIIu2zU=/64x0:4437x2915/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833566/1231204418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transmission towers and power lines lead to a substation after a snowstorm on February 16th, 2021, in Fort Worth, Texas. Winter storm Uri has brought historic cold weather and power outages to Texas as storms have swept across 26 states with a mix of freezing temperatures and precipitation.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Ron Jenkins / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hqwMYw"&gt;Texas’ massive energy crisis didn’t have to happen, experts say — and it doesn’t have to happen again. Authorities can start working on solutions now that could prevent future blackouts. But unless the state gets to work fast, its energy system will be vulnerable to the next shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3c9BMD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Unless the state gets to work fast, its energy system will be vulnerable to the next shock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pf11MN"&gt;For starters, Texas’ grid needs to prepare for more blows from extreme weather, and the change can’t stop there. Upgrading homes and buildings is a straightforward way to keep people safe during catastrophic conditions like this week’s cold snap. Emergency response efforts need an update, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDBBYC"&gt;Michael Bates, general manager of Energy at Intel, lives in Austin where he and his mother have not had power for three days. “She’s 86 years old and living like a pioneer woman in front of the fireplace,” Bates says. “To me, it’s unnecessary. There is technology today that, if we deploy properly, the next time this goes around, the pain will be much less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWGfHj"&gt;Bates is working to develop smart grid technology at Intel that can figure out where energy is being wasted so that power can be deployed where it’s actually needed in a crisis. There was &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/texas-suffers-power-outage-photos-downtown-houston-lit-1569573"&gt;outrage&lt;/a&gt;, for example, over empty brightly lit skyscrapers that loomed over downtown Houston on Monday night while more than 1.3 million people around the city &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/downtown-skyscrapers-turn-off-their-lights-after-complaints-during-power-outages/285-ab56790c-0758-485f-84ab-2aff33440f34"&gt;faced imminent outages&lt;/a&gt;. Utilities said that some neighborhoods &lt;a href="https://thewire.oncor.com/Pages/Article.html#Oncor__Emergency_Operations_FEB_15_Afternoon_Update"&gt;avoided blackouts&lt;/a&gt; because they were near hospitals or other critical infrastructure that needed to keep power. That uneven distribution of outages wouldn’t be an issue with a smart grid, says Bates. “In laser, scalpel-like precision, you can turn the building lights off or down … and avoid having to do the rolling blackouts by being able to connect in real time to those assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCPzAm"&gt;That kind of upgrade to the grid can also make it easier to tap energy from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523976/virtual-power-plants-solar-energy-grid-resilience-climate-change"&gt;distributed resources&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403271/virtual-power-plants-california-apartment-buildings-solar-energy"&gt;residential solar panels&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451642/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-energy-grid-battery-day-elon-musk"&gt;electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. When connected to batteries and smart grids, renewable energy sources can provide consistency on par or even better than the system we have now that relies on fossil fuels. “The industry might see it as it’s highly disruptive, but the solutions and the technology are not that complicated. They exist today, it’s just how do we apply them to this problem?” says Bates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5gQJsC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The solutions and the technology are not that complicated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="abw1Bb"&gt;Other fixes rely on rethinking Texas’ energy and infrastructure policies rather than on adopting new technologies. The state’s &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-grid-again-faces-scrutiny-over-cold-15955392.php"&gt;energy system could still do more&lt;/a&gt; to weatherize their system against the cold — something that was recommended after similar cold-induced blackouts in 2011 and 1989. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;Frozen gas wells and pipes&lt;/a&gt; were a big culprit behind current outages, even though authorities knew they were vulnerable to frigid temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsMon4"&gt;The Lone Star State also lives up to its moniker when it comes to its energy infrastructure. Other states’ grids are interconnected, so one state can draw on power from another state when needed. &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/texas-power-grid-electric-tribune-explainer-trib/10344231/"&gt;That’s not the case for most of Texas&lt;/a&gt;. “There are parts of the grid on the East Coast or the West Coast that have excess power right now that they could be selling to us, but we just don’t have any way of getting into it,” says Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at The University of Texas at Austin. “Maybe we should be better interconnected with other parts of the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSYylz"&gt;Any makeover of Texas’ power grid — whether it involves making it smarter, or connecting it to the rest of the country — needs to start happening soon. “If we had another storm like this in two weeks, we’d probably have the exact same thing happen. It takes years and decades sometimes to build infrastructure,” Rhodes says. “We should start now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0mAT7"&gt;Disaster management plans, on the other hand, can shift a lot faster and could achieve some of the same goals as efforts aimed at upgrading the grid. “Focusing on how you deal with emergencies, in terms of actually providing services to people is maybe more productive than thinking about specific upgrades to the grid, sometimes,” says Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrV8yp"&gt;Some of those are simple and already underway. During this storm, communities &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-power-outage-help-warming-shelter/"&gt;opened up “warming centers”&lt;/a&gt; where people can take shelter in a place with heating if their power is out at home. It’s similar to a strategy that a lot of cities use during heatwaves; they open up “cooling centers” where people can gather for free air conditioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7LVoMM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s always going to be something that we didn’t prepare for&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CBFXUd"&gt;Weatherizing homes is another easy way to keep people safe in future weather disasters Grubert and Rhodes say. The added benefit is that better insulation protects against extreme temperature swings in either direction. That’s an important consideration since, overall, climate change is steering Texas toward more extreme heat, not extreme cold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOaxXo"&gt;Ultimately, protecting people from devastating power outages in the future will require anticipating new catastrophes — not just responding to the prior ones. “We tend to see this a lot with infrastructure systems where we have one emergency and we start to want to react to basically prevent this particular emergency from happening again,” Grubert says. “I think what I would rather see us focus on after this event, is really thinking about how we respond to emergency conditions. There’s always going to be something that we didn’t prepare for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dihftr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWTCNt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox cult classic Stubbs the Zombie is getting remastered for modern consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oNNnS-KUNUv0kPKuRyUOptPYOJ0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833376/Stubbs_KeyArt_Xbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Aspyr Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k2Vyqy"&gt;If you ever wanted a zombie game where you played as the undead instead of fending off against it, you’ll have another chance soon. &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse&lt;/em&gt; is being rereleased on March 16th for PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One and will be playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S via backwards compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8Dgr5"&gt;Aspyr Media, the company that originally published &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie,&lt;/em&gt; is handling the port. The studio recently worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301436/star-wars-episode-1-racer-ps4-switch-release-price"&gt;porting &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Episode I: Racer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to modern consoles, so it’s safe to say this remaster is in good hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjJcXK"&gt;Originally released in 2005 on the Xbox, &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie &lt;/em&gt;has players control the titular character with the main goal of wreaking havoc and devouring human brains. It’s a third-person action title developed by the now-defunct Wideload Games. The game also came to Windows and Mac OS X roughly a month after its original release date, with a release on &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/1041/"&gt;Steam coming nearly two years later&lt;/a&gt;, which was later removed from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3slmw"&gt;The announcement is good news for fans who played the 2005 original. In recent years, &lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie&lt;/em&gt; has become one of the rarest games to own on the original Xbox. Microsoft made the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080520083014/http://majornelson.com/Default.aspx"&gt;game available digitally for the Xbox 360 in 2008&lt;/a&gt; as an Xbox Originals title, but the company &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_gapp/stubbs-the-zombie-gone-from-the-marketplace-why/9131cced-77ca-4fb4-b60f-40a649004c7b#:~:text=Yes%2C%20Stubbs%20the%20Zombie%20is,keep%20an%20eye%20on%20it."&gt;pulled it from the Xbox Live Marketplace in late 2012&lt;/a&gt;. With no other ways to play the game in nearly a decade, your only option was to own an original Xbox console and a physical copy, which is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3DStubbs%2BThe%2BZombie%2Bin%2BRebel%2BWithout%2Ba%2BPulse%2B%26_sacat%3D0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22280459%2Fstubbs-the-zombie-remaster-release-date-pc-playstation-switch-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pretty pricey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Knockout City is a new dodgeball game from the makers of Mario Kart Live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpCvpSfuThybOmLddWWphrLKLY0=/19x0:3259x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833380/KOC_Key_Art_Standard_Horizontal_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Velan Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SLeiHC"&gt;Velan Studios, the studio behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;mixed-reality racer &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed its next title: &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a team-based online dodgeball game. And it’s launching soon, as the game will be released on May 21st on Origin, Steam, the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, with enhancements for the PS5 and Xbox Series X. EA is publishing the game under its EA Originals label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipAUZl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;’s take on dodgeball is similar to what you probably played in gym class. You and your team are trying to hit your opponents with balls while simultaneously avoiding and catching the balls thrown at you. In addition to straight-on throws, you can curve your shots, lob balls over obstacles, and even fake throws to try to catch your opponent off-balance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C7CUnJUcd9ZOGbcpqjS8dY0EjpU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307605/KOC_SCREENSHOT01_ACTION_13c.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Velan Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sEzk7H"&gt;But there’s quite a bit that you probably didn’t have to deal with when you played dodgeball as a kid. There are balls with special powers, like a bomb ball that will blow up (hopefully not in your hands). You can also turn &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; into a ball, and your teammates can pass you around, chuck you at enemies, or even use your balled-up form for a special attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQTEWK"&gt;You’ll automatically lock onto nearby opponents, meaning that you won’t have to worry as much about aiming as you would in other team-based games. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; seems to be more about strategically timing your throws or coordinating with your teammates to get a good angle on someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVJqJG"&gt;The game also has a slick street-inspired style that’s aided by the huge variety of in-game cosmetics available. You can unlock new cosmetics through completing certain tasks or by buying them with Holobux, &lt;em&gt;Knockout City’s &lt;/em&gt;in-game currency. And from what I could tell, the game seems to have a great soundtrack. During a preview event, I heard a jazzy big-band song that would feel right at home in an &lt;em&gt;Incredibles&lt;/em&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1Me6FIccO4f609xJDvJpsXFk9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309109/KOC_SCREENSHOT02_CREWS_03.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Velan Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cyV0DL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City’s&lt;/em&gt; approachable-looking take on dodgeball and its distinctive style all reminded me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Splatoon, &lt;/em&gt;which put a Nintendo spin on the team-based shooter genre with great results. I haven’t been able to try &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; myself yet, but I’m looking forward to giving it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRIDMd"&gt;The game will cost $19.99, and that flat fee will give you access to all of the game’s nine-week seasons. Velan Studios plans to offer a free trial of the full game when it launches, but it hasn’t announced how long that trial will last. There will also be a closed beta on PC on February 20th and 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8t2iHf"&gt;The game will also have crossplay and cross-progression between platforms, but you’ll have to buy &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; for each platform on which you want to play it. That might be a tough pill to swallow if you’re used to playing games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; on whatever device you happen to be using at the time without having to buy the game outright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Splatoon 3 is coming to the Nintendo Switch in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Splatoon 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7iTEhFIjGMh2AFzhzjY0ZO3C2fs=/1x0:1357x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833372/splatoon3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Txkrtg"&gt;Nintendo ended its Direct live stream on Wednesday with a surprise announcement of &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoJrNa"&gt;Very little about the game was shown in the introduction trailer beyond customization options for a player’s inkling and what at first glance appears to be a more narrative-focused approach, showing the inkling traveling by train from a desert location to a large Tokyo-style city. Nintendo has this to say about the game in its YouTube trailer description: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZmywaH"&gt;Splatoon 3 arrives on Nintendo Switch in 2022! In the wake of chaos, enter the sun scorched Splatlands and the new city, Splatsville, inhabited by battle-hardened Inklings and Octolings. New weapons, moves, and more await, so be sure to keep an eye out for updates in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EjXW1L"&gt;It’s not clear what else &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3 &lt;/em&gt;will offer, though the trailer did eventually show off what looked like the series’s signature multiplayer gameplay in which players are tasked with splattering as much colored ink across the environment as possible to overtake their opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErSCBP"&gt;Nintendo did confirm that &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3&lt;/em&gt; will be coming to the Switch in 2022, so there’s plenty of time for the company to reveal more details about the game in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
