  &lt;p id="oe9ohF"&gt;TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/share-sounds-and-login-with-tiktok-through-all-new-developer-kits"&gt;announced two new integrations&lt;/a&gt; for its app on Thursday: sharing audio back into TikTok using the new Sound Kit, and using your TikTok account to log in to other apps with Login Kit. Developers can apply to use the new SDKs to insert the short-form video app’s content in even more places, but they may open the company and its users to new privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00nlu6"&gt;The basic features of Login Kit will sound familiar. Facebook, Twitter, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17407334/snapchat-snapkit-ar-camera-developer-kit-login-platform"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; already offer similar integrations to speed up the logging in process. Like those other versions, TikTok says that using Login Kit will allow users to securely log in to other apps, but also let developers offer TikTok content inside those apps, like adding videos to a dating profile. Using Login with TikTok also requires you to allow whatever app you’re using to view your public profile and videos in order to work but doesn’t currently extend to the other information TikTok may know about you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ONCWPC37eoPhVQzeBEL0T3TVh2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496319/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.15.03_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the Login with TikTok experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6NmS6t"&gt;Logging in with another social media account is convenient, but it comes with some baggage. Facebook in particular has been criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17148726/facebook-developer-data-crackdown-cambridge-analytica"&gt;for the data that gets collected with Facebook Login&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the sources of information at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;the Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok has also been scrutinized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;for its surveillance potential&lt;/a&gt; and a previous version of the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature"&gt;that accessed users’ clipboards&lt;/a&gt;. In regards to Login Kit, TikTok says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DygHs5"&gt;Similar to other platforms’ SDKs, the only data TikTok can collect through Login Kit is the app’s name and associated events on our platform (i.e. event tracking for logins and authorizations). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPKDn8QP2PUwWgn955ye0MWrKww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496321/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.15.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing audio from outside apps to TikTok using Sound Kit and Login Kit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TnbfNe"&gt;One of the things that makes TikTok so compelling is all of the music it licenses for use in videos. With Sound Kit, that library of music could theoretically become even bigger, without TikTok having to strike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546323/tiktok-sony-music-licensing-deal-labels-app"&gt;new deals with the big music labels&lt;/a&gt;. Sound Kit allows developers to share audio between their apps and TikTok, so if you make a particularly great mix in one app, you can start using it in your videos. To enable audio sharing, developers will have to integrate Login Kit and the accompanying permissions into their apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O52i0L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok’s audio library could grow even larger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ocNuEr"&gt;Developers have to apply to use TikTok’s tools and SDKs and abide by the company’s guidelines, but it’s easy to imagine some potentially sketchy use cases for Sound Kit, like sharing audio without a creator’s permission or pirating music. TikTok says the sounds shared through Sound Kit are treated like any other kind of audio on the platform. Audio clips can either be private or publicly shareable, and TikTok says&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CUlOI6"&gt;When a sound is shared to TikTok, we scan it for attribution to ensure it is original audio - if it’s identified as professionally generated content we label it as such in the music detail page &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFJf5"&gt;TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok"&gt;already incredibly popular&lt;/a&gt; just by being a social media app with great video tools, but SDKs like Login Kit and Sound Kit show the app is maturing. With the new SDKs, there’s an even greater possibility TikTok’s features could become as ubiquitous as embedding a Tweet or sharing your Facebook friends list. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The chip shortage is making cars more expensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A General Motors Car Dealership Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9O1-SPHS0W_yvs7WBk9jb0aebQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252331/1232684258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RhPA4E"&gt;New cars are getting more expensive thanks to the global semiconductor shortage. And the price of used cars is going up, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAjNEc"&gt;About 13 percent of people who bought a new car in the US in April paid above sticker price, according to Jessica Caldwell, director of insights at Edmunds. Last year, only 8 percent of buyers paid more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMBU97"&gt;New vehicle prices have been on the rise for a while now, but the shortage is only worsening the trend. Automakers are &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-chip-shortage-set-to-worsen-for-car-makers-11619708393"&gt;temporarily shutting down production lines&lt;/a&gt; around the world. The chips they &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;able to source are going into the most popular new vehicles — the ones that make the most money. To make matters worse, demand for new cars and trucks is increasing, leading to markups. This has pushed more consumers to the used vehicle market, which is… driving up prices there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21Dvni"&gt;General Motors &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-first-quarter-profit-jumps-despite-chip-shortage-2021-05-05/"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; that its new full-size trucks cost 10 percent more than they did last year, and its full-size SUVs cost more than 20 percent more. Ford’s new vehicles shot up in price by $1,900 &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than the average industry increase in 2019. But overall &lt;a href="https://wardsintelligence.informa.com/WI965651/April-US-LightVehicle-Sales-Top-18-MillionPlus-Annualized-Rate-Second-Straight-Month"&gt;sales are way up&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e8RN34"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Prices are just soaring.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GO8vXv"&gt;“Prices are just soaring,” Caldwell says. “And as high as the prices go, it seems like it doesn’t really deter people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG2lne"&gt;Prices will likely keep climbing as the chip shortage keeps thinning supply. Automakers like Ford and Volkswagen have said they expect to take an even worse hit to production this quarter. Ford will only make half as many cars as it originally expected, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;said this week during its quarterly investor call&lt;/a&gt;. “We are, for sure, in crisis mode,” Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess said &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/05/06/vw-chip-shortage-profit-projection/"&gt;about the next few months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3QVBn"&gt;Some, like GM, have said they think &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-first-quarter-profit-jumps-despite-chip-shortage-2021-05-05/"&gt;lower output won’t be a huge problem&lt;/a&gt;. But the supply of new cars will further dry up for other reasons. Up until now, dealers were working with a cushion of inventory that was built up before the production halts began. The summer months are typically when seasonal demand for new cars really starts to rise, Caldwell says, and this is also no typical summer. Millions of people received stimulus checks, and vaccines for the coronavirus have finally been widely rolled out. “I imagine this year [demand] will be even higher because people are itching to go out, go places, go on road trips, go back to school,” Caldwell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URxTHV"&gt;The price of a new car was already increasing in the US as consumers flocked to larger SUVs and trucks with more advanced features, so the chip shortage has supercharged the trend. There are other contributing factors, too. Higher sticker prices became easier to swallow once automakers and banks &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/84-month-auto-loans-are-becoming-more-common-because-yo-1825414883"&gt;started offering loans&lt;/a&gt; with 84-month and 96-month terms. Those extra-long financing options got even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; palatable when automakers started offering zero-percent financing deals to boost sales early in the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqHn7s"&gt;The high demand for new cars could be tested as more automakers are starting to &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-to-strip-out-high-tech-features"&gt;sacrifice certain features due to the chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. Some Dodge Ram pickups will no longer have an intelligent rear view mirror as a standard feature, and Nissan is eschewing navigation systems in many of its vehicles. GM decided in March that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;would keep making its most popular trucks&lt;/a&gt; without a particular module that normally increases fuel economy, meaning the trucks will pollute more &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;guzzle even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hon4RI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Low supply, high demand, and it’s only going to get worse near term&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yS2sYJ"&gt;But there is already such an inventory crush, and so many people buying, that these changes might not matter much, Caldwell says. “I think [those features] can delight you and probably move you closer to a vehicle purchase, but people don’t drive different cars all the time and may not be savvy enough to know what should or shouldn’t be there,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syKdYr"&gt;With wages relatively stagnant, Cox Automotive executive analyst Michelle Krebs says she worries this will make it even harder for average buyers to get into newer, safer cars. “The average household income used to be enough to buy a new car, but it’s not anymore. It’s more like a 14 year old used car,” she says. “It’s the opposite of what Henry Ford envisioned — people who make the car can’t afford the new cars, right?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04i5g9"&gt;But used car prices are going up, too, aided in part by the chip shortage. Higher average selling prices for new cars paired with increasingly low inventory means more people are turning to the used car market, which is causing more competition between buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3P2pam"&gt;Used car prices were already on the rise for a few other reasons. Rental companies typically sell into the used car market, but they dumped much of their inventory last year as the travel industry flatlined. Now, with travel recovering as more people get vaccinated, rental companies are &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/05/04/rental-car-companies-crash-used-car-auctions-to-find-scarce-vehicles/"&gt;bidding against used car buyers&lt;/a&gt; to get some of those vehicles back, which is pushing up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cem290"&gt;Newly off-lease cars are another usual source for the used car market, but automakers have been encouraging some customers to extend their leases because of winnowing new car inventory, says Krebs. A decline in repossessions during the pandemic has also weakened the supply of used cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vayGtN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sedans actually rebounded a bit, but it won’t last&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhf43k"&gt;The chip shortage has exacerbated many of these pricing trends, but it may have temporarily reversed one that previously seemed irreversible. According to data compiled by &lt;a href="https://wardsintelligence.informa.com/WI965651/April-US-LightVehicle-Sales-Top-18-MillionPlus-Annualized-Rate-Second-Straight-Month"&gt;Ward’s Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, sedans actually picked up a few percentage points of overall market share in the US in April. Karl Brauer, executive analyst at &lt;a href="http://iSeeCars.com"&gt;iSeeCars.com&lt;/a&gt;, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; his team sees the same thing. That could mean some buyers are considering a much different middle-ground option between fighting to buy the new trucks and SUVs that are in demand and scouring the used market: settling for a smaller, more traditional new car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXzAUY"&gt;While that trend would be better for pedestrian safety and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/01/suv-conquered-america-climate-change-emissions"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; in the long run, it’s not likely to stick. US automakers have all but abandoned sedans, and even the foreign automakers who’ve been happy to fill that vacuum for the last few years are also focusing more on pickup trucks and SUVs. Long term, Krebs says, consumers are just willing to pay more for bigger, more well-equipped vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgxS7i"&gt;“The one thing they are not willing to do, they will not go from a sport utility vehicle to a car,” she says. “That is just dead on arrival.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp relaxes deadline for accepting its new privacy policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7PdduIZi0XFNZQ3SthvyFQq7iM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252305/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h10lMi"&gt;In a new statement posted on its website, WhatsApp says users won’t lose any functionality if they fail to accept its new privacy policy by May 15th. “No one will have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of WhatsApp on May 15th because of this update,” the &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/?lang=en"&gt;FAQ now reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRh0ow"&gt;That’s different from what the page originally said when it was posted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294919/whatsapp-privacy-policy-may-15th-messaging-calls-limited-functionality"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, when it warned that failing to accept the new terms by the May deadline would mean users would lose functionality. “We’ve extended the effective date to May 15th,” the page &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210220081302if_/https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;. “If you haven’t accepted by then, WhatsApp will not delete your account. However, &lt;em&gt;you won’t have full functionality of WhatsApp until you accept.&lt;/em&gt; For a short time, you’ll be able to receive calls and notifications, but won’t be able to read or send messages from the app [emphasis added].” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pC59Fi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No one will have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of WhatsApp on May 15th because of this update”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60lIBz"&gt;Although WhatsApp has relaxed the deadline for accepting the new policy, it’s still coming into force, sources with knowledge of WhatsApp’s plans confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll still be effective from May 15th for new users and for people who’ve already accepted the policy. The difference is that anyone who doesn’t accept the policy now won’t lose full functionality immediately. Instead, they’ll be shown a reminder to accept the new policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4pMK1"&gt;That’ll change after a period of several weeks when this reminder will become what WhatsApp is referring to as a “persistent reminder.” It’s at this point that the app’s functionality will become limited. Although users will still be able to answer incoming calls and respond to messages by tapping on notifications, they won’t be able to access the standard chat list from within the app. Finally, after a few additional weeks, users will lose this “limited functionality” entirely. WhatsApp says it &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-inactive-account-deletion"&gt;generally deletes inactive accounts&lt;/a&gt; after 120 days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bGkIie4B96DDw-tsO9z0rBctJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498538/ezgif_2_509a7a0a2543.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s explanation of what “limited functionality” will mean for users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cMW4tx"&gt;“We’ve spent the last several months providing more information about our update to users around the world,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement. “In that time, the majority of people who have received it have accepted the update and WhatsApp continues to grow. However, for those that have not yet had a chance to do so, their accounts will not be deleted or lose functionality on May 15. We’ll continue to provide reminders to those users within WhatsApp in the weeks to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teVHpT"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy has faced fierce backlash over worries that it weakens the chat service’s encryption or allows it to share more of users’ personal data with parent company Facebook. However, the policy doesn’t change the fact that personal messages between users are end-to-end encrypted, meaning only each recipient can read them. Instead, it relates to messages sent to businesses on WhatsApp. These may be stored on Facebook’s servers, and their data may be used for advertising. WhatsApp already shares some user data with Facebook, like phone numbers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;has done so since 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKQDCm"&gt;This information hasn’t done much to calm the controversy, which resulted in rival messaging apps Telegram and Signal reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surges in new users&lt;/a&gt;. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk got involved, tweeting “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153"&gt;Use Signal&lt;/a&gt;” to his millions of followers at the beginning of January. In response to the outcry, WhatsApp said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delay the introduction of its new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; by three months from February to May. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Xbox testimony, Apple tells Microsoft to put up or shut up</title>

  &lt;p id="JQl1bQ"&gt;As the first week of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial comes to a close, Apple is picking a fight over one of Epic’s witnesses. The fight centers on testimony from Lori Wright, Microsoft’s vice president of Xbox business development, who testified about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;the distinction between “general purpose” and “special purpose” devices&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday in favor of Epic’s claim. Wright’s testimony set off a day of confusion over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;whether Microsoft actually makes money selling Xbox hardware&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is now asking the judge for an “adverse credibility finding,” basically a determination that Wright’s testimony can’t be trusted because of irregularities in document production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPwu96"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700170-epic-apple-strike-lori-wright-microsoft-testimony"&gt;In a new filing&lt;/a&gt;, Apple argued that some of the documents referred to in Wright’s testimony weren’t produced in advance, and the entire testimony should fall under a cloud. Apple’s lawyers zeroed in on Wright’s claim that Xbox hardware was sold at cost in order to subsidize game sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyOqrG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft really does not want to give Apple sensitive financial data about the Xbox&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gwZDZ"&gt;“Ms. Wright testified about the supposed unprofitability of Microsoft’s console business without providing the P&amp;amp;L statement from her files that could have substantiated (or disproven) her testimony,” Apple’s filing argues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KWLaI"&gt;Apple has actually made this case before, arguing back in April that Wright’s testimony should be stricken from the record because of irregular document production in the weeks leading up to the trial. Now, they’re arguing that Wright stepped outside of the preset parameters of her testimony, and her entire testimony should be deemed not credible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc4lCL"&gt;And at the center of it all is Microsoft’s profit-and-loss analysis for the Xbox hardware, which no one on the Apple side has seen. It’s worth remembering here that Apple and Microsoft have been locked in heated competition for decades now, and while Apple doesn’t have a product competing specifically against the Xbox, the broader companies are tied up in a delicate balance of fierce competition and business cooperation. As a result, Microsoft really does not want to give Apple sensitive financial data about the Xbox — and Apple sees the P&amp;amp;L statement as a way to punch back at Microsoft for getting involved in the App Store fight in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDhWoP"&gt;From the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, documents have been an issue — and it’s likely to continue being a problem as long as the proceedings go on. Both sides agreed in advance to upload exhibits to a public Box folder (&lt;a href="https://app.box.com/s/6b9wmjvr582c95uzma1136exumk6p989/folder/135953042066"&gt;it’s here&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to follow along), but the actual use of that folder has been extremely chaotic. On the first day of the proceedings, more than 100 different filings were uploaded to the general exhibits folder, only to have a handful clawed back as sealed — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;some of the Sony docs we published here&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly every day, documents have been added to the Box and then pulled back, to the point where we’ve had to mirror the whole thing just to make sure we don’t miss anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhxlRy"&gt;Some of this is normal. A big part of the legal fight is over which documents can be used in the trial and which parts of those documents can be blacked out to conceal trade secrets or other information the companies would rather not get out. The companies’ lawyers have been going back and forth on these tiny details for months; it’s just what lawyers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrNmuS"&gt;But it’s fair to say this case has been unusually chaotic — either because of the remote nature of the trial or the sheer volume of different companies involved. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of information has come out of the discovery in this case, and not all of it was supposed to. Now, Microsoft is caught between giving up information that could help in court and giving up business secrets to a longtime rival. Microsoft wants Epic to win this case, and it’s willing to talk about Xbox profitability if it helps to make that happen. But giving up that information in open court might be a bridge too far.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Longing is deliberately slow and tedious, but I can’t stop playing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaojRGJjCb53ExVomm_dUyKgwAI=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252223/EzCYq3jVEAAFuWD.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mKCmMN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt; feels like a troll. It’s a game that takes 400 real-world days to finish, and it moves at a pace that could only generously be described as glacial. The first word that ever appears on screen is “Wait!” Simple tasks, like walking up some stairs or opening a door, drag on forever. And yet, here I am, a month after I first started, and I can’t seem to stop playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jelzgw"&gt;The game puts you in the role of a “shade,” a small creature who lives in service to an ancient king. At the outset of &lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt;, the king tells you he must go into a kind of hibernation and leaves you to, well, wait. The towering king sits in a giant throne, occasionally snoring, and you’re left alone in a dark, twisting, subterranean world. You have 400 days until he wakes up. What are you going to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mojBxm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zwrk5K74-Cg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W7Rtmk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt; is, at its core, a game about killing time. There’s no explicit goal other than to wait, as the clock ticks down whether you’re playing or not (you can actually see the countdown at all times, an ever-present part of the game’s interface). The game takes place in the crumbling remnants of a long-forgotten underground kingdom. You have a small room beside the king’s throne — one you can customize by hanging pictures, building a bed, or digging out an extra room — but the rest of the place is one giant maze. You’ll come across stairs leading in every direction, and tunnels that end with multiple doors to walk through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRaSCw"&gt;Your main obstacle in exploring is the pace. The shade moves almost comically slow, shuffling along as if it’s not in any rush at all. There’s definitely no run button. Sometimes you’ll come across areas that are inaccessible for weeks. You might have to wait for a dripping ceiling to fill in a hole so you can swim across, or for a patch of moss to grow to break your fall after jumping off a cliff. To make things even more challenging, there’s no map, so it’s easy to get lost or struggle to find your way back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDBC0F"&gt;Moving through &lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt; becomes almost meditative. For the most part, nothing happens, but every so often you’ll come across something really cool, like an ancient library where you can raid all of the books, or a waterfall splashing on to crystals, or maybe a room filled with a bright light that never seems to end. I’ve made “friends” with a spider and talked to a stone wall. As you explore, the shade will talk to itself in tweet-worthy missives like “this seems like a great place to be lonely” or “I have never understood life.” If you don’t feel like wandering, you can always just sit down and read &lt;em&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/em&gt; or spend time drawing sketches to decorate your home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Longing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZ59HZyvfi9CKKzwdbi2f9v8k64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498320/E0KyegaVgAAZTzh.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rEQ5I8"&gt;In some ways, &lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt; almost plays like an idle browser game, something you set in the background and return to when something interesting happens. Those games are often about watching numbers increase over time, like in a roleplaying game, but in &lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt; you simply get a quiet space for contemplation. Some aspects can be automated: you can ask the shade to go for a walk to a random place or head home without any player input. There have been times when I’ve set the shade to do a task — like digging a new room in its hovel or using a pickaxe to knock down a shiny jewel — before heading off to do something in the real world, like wash the dishes or vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJSXOk"&gt;Much of the time &lt;em&gt;The Longing&lt;/em&gt; is boring, though that’s by design. It makes the moments of discovery all the more thrilling. It’s become a habit for me, spending an hour or so each day making my way through its winding halls, in hopes of finding something new or interesting. Sometimes I stumble across a wall covered in ancient symbols. Other times I climb a huge set of stairs that lead to nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hrv6C"&gt;Is it worth all of that time and effort? I’ll tell you in 353 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbNsXE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Longing &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on PC and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Amazon union vote is being appealed, and the hearing begins today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmRUxncFmtMm2wGJ96FaGz9IvTI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252169/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppIMib"&gt;A new phase of the historic union vote by Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama begins today. The news kicks off with an appeals hearing where the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) will contest the results of the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnFCAz"&gt;“Things are not over,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings. “We all need to be continuing to pay attention to this part.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ5WOE"&gt;Earlier this year, after a months-long union busting campaign, workers voted 1,798 to 738 against forming a union. The decision was hailed as a crushing blow to the labor movement. But experts say the election was always going to be hotly contested. Even if RWDSU won, Amazon would almost certainly have fought the results, and the process would still have ended up in an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9npu3U"&gt;That wasn’t clear from the media coverage, which treated the election as the apex of the labor movement. “I think that it’s fair to say that very few people in labor actually thought that this was going to be a win,” Dubal says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPqDE1"&gt;Witness testimony begins Monday, with RWDSU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391761/union-objection-amazon-election-bessemer-layoffs"&gt;presenting evidence on each of its 23 objections&lt;/a&gt;. These range from Amazon installing a ballot collection box at the warehouse (allegedly giving the illusion that it controlled the vote) to threatening workers with pay cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnqupd"&gt;If RWDSU is successful, there would likely be another election, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/union-appeals-amazon-election-in-complaint-claiming-misconduct?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. But regardless of the outcome, Dubal says the campaign has already succeeded in spreading awareness. “The role that the Bessemer drive played was in part an attention getting campaign and a way to get America to look at the conditions in these warehouses,” she says. “It was still a very, very important drive, representing a cultural shift in people thinking about and talking about Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3DPC5"&gt;The campaign also laid bare Amazon’s union busting tactics — typical for many companies — like bombarding workers with anti-union messages and requiring them to attend captive audience meetings. “Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees,” RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391761/union-objection-amazon-election-bessemer-layoffs"&gt;which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. “We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP083M"&gt;Many of the tactics Amazon used are legal under current labor law. While the National Labor Relations Act is supposed to protect workers’ rights to organize, companies rarely face significant consequences for union busting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wI4M0I"&gt;That could change if the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (also known as the PRO Act) passes. The legislation would ban companies from holding captive audiences and it would establish fines for those that violate workers’ rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVgHJw"&gt;Dubal says that’s partly why the appeal hearing matters. “It’s imperative that we continue to pay attention to this,” she says. “It’s a learning moment. We are learning what is legal and illegal. We’re learning what companies do to suppress organizing. This needs to be public knowledge so that we understand why a law like the PRO Act is so important.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h27UDP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9gZKm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reportedly shelves Windows 10X, its Chrome OS competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tv1mWCa9KzUt2EO19400LtFVVeA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252153/akrales_190930_3649_0349.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c7Fr1C"&gt;Microsoft has been trying to build a lighter version of Windows for more than 10 years without success. The latest effort, Windows 10X, has reportedly now been shelved, in favor of improving Windows 10 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi0dPB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://petri.com/microsoft-shelves-windows-10x-it-is-not-shipping-in-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Petri &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Windows 10X will no longer ship this year, and the OS will likely never arrive in its current form. Microsoft had originally been planning to deliver Windows 10X, a more lightweight and simplified version of Windows, alongside new dual-screen devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;. That was before the pandemic hit, and Microsoft decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;prioritize Windows 10X for single-screen laptops instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcFMPevTNZw1fOQabEDKCqhp0RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19247635/akrales_190930_3649_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Neo was supposed to ship with Windows 10X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fzdKuz"&gt;The switch was designed to position Windows 10X as more of a Chrome OS competitor. Windows 10X included a simplified interface, an updated Start menu without Live Tiles, multitasking improvements, and a special app container for performance and security. Microsoft’s overall goal with 10X was to create a stripped-back, streamlined, and modern cloud-powered version of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPEjZq"&gt;Microsoft has always seen Chromebooks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15794404/microsoft-scared-chrome-os-schools-businesses"&gt;as a big threat in businesses and schools&lt;/a&gt;, but over the past year there has been a big increase in demand for regular Windows laptops. Despite a global chip shortage, the PC market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380920/pc-market-q1-growth-year-over-year-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;hasn’t slowed down&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Microsoft has directly benefited with increased Windows revenue. Windows OEM revenue grew by 10 percent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406254/microsoft-q3-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;in the recent quarter&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting strong consumer PC demand. Windows non-pro OEM revenue also grew by 44 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzWJwT"&gt;There are now 1.3 billion active Windows 10 devices, according to Microsoft. That’s a huge amount of existing devices, and it appears Microsoft is now focused on improving the core of Windows instead of delivering a new variant. Microsoft has been gradually working on improving the user interface of Windows 10, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52XmxAfkJfUlgfCesc_0hq6pVyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235018/windows10xhandson.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 10X Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wyPb2M"&gt;All of these visual changes are part of a broader effort codenamed Sun Valley. Microsoft has not yet officially detailed this work, but a job listing earlier this year teased a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.” We’re expecting a lot of visual changes to arrive in the Windows 10 21H2 update that should appear in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLskcK"&gt;Elsewhere, Microsoft is also focusing on improving Windows for those who rely on it daily. The software maker is finally fixing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, adding the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt; and even improving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHHqKL"&gt;It’s clear Microsoft is getting back to the basics, after more than a decade of trying to simplify Windows. Windows RT first debuted in 2012, and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15506378/microsoft-windows-10-s-os-operating-system-announced-features"&gt;Windows 10 S arrived in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Both failed to simplify Windows, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X had some interesting changes&lt;/a&gt; that will undoubtedly make their way to Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla privately admits Elon Musk has been exaggerating about ‘full self-driving’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="chpoPG"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been overstating the capabilities of the company’s advanced driver assist system, the company’s director of Autopilot software told the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The comments came from &lt;a href="https://www.plainsite.org/documents/28jcs0/california-dmv-tesla-robotaxi--fsd-notes/"&gt;a memo released by legal transparency group PlainSite&lt;/a&gt;, which obtained the documents from a public records request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWalHR"&gt;It was the latest revelation about the widening gap between what Musk says publicly about Autopilot and what Autopilot can actually do. And it coincides with Tesla coming under increased scrutiny after a Tesla vehicle without anyone in the driver’s seat crashed in Texas, killing two men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A116Zj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Elon’s tweet does not match engineering reality per CJ”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7DGYEN"&gt;“Elon’s tweet does not match engineering reality per CJ. Tesla is at Level 2 currently,” the California DMV said in the memo about its March 9th conference call with Tesla representatives, including the director of Autopilot software CJ Moore. Level 2 technology refers to a semi-automated driving system, which requires supervision by a human driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDeOEj"&gt;In an earnings call in January, Musk told investors that he was “highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.” (It would appear the DMV was referring to these January comments, which Moore misunderstood as a tweet from Musk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSOSr2"&gt;Last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527577/tesla-full-self-driving-autopilot-beta-software-update"&gt;Tesla introduced a new product called “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta&lt;/a&gt; to vehicle owners in its Early Access Program. The update enabled drivers to access Autopilot’s partially automated driver assist system on city streets and local roads. The early access program is used as a testing platform to help iron out software bugs. In the DMV memo, Tesla said that as of March 9th there were 824 vehicles in the pilot program, including 753 employees and 71 non-employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egkgDf"&gt;Musk has said the company was handling the software update “very cautiously.” Drivers still are expected to keep their hands on the steering wheel and should be prepared to assume control of their Tesla at any time. But he has also offered lofty predictions about Tesla’s ability to achieve full autonomy that conflict with what his own engineers are saying to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyF4T6"&gt;Tesla is unlikely to achieve Level 5 (L5) autonomy, in which its cars can drive themselves anywhere, under any conditions, without any human supervision, by the end of 2021, Tesla representatives told the DMV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="eAOeiY"&gt;The ratio of driver interaction would need to be in the magnitude of 1 or 2 million miles per driver interaction to move into higher levels of automation. Tesla indicated that Elon is extrapolating on the rates of improvement when speaking about L5 capabilities. Tesla couldn’t say if the rate of improvement would make it to L5 by end of calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hyhoCo"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Tesla’s private communications with the DMV have contradicted Musk’s public declarations about his company’s autonomous capabilities. In March, &lt;a href="https://www.plainsite.org/documents/242a2g/california-dmv-tesla-robotaxi--fsd-emails/"&gt;PlainSite published&lt;/a&gt; communications from last December between Tesla’s associate general counsel Eric Williams and California DMV’s chief of the autonomous vehicles branch, Miguel Acosta. In it, Williams notes that “neither Autopilot nor FSD Capability is an autonomous system, and currently no comprising feature, whether singularly or collectively, is autonomous or makes our vehicles autonomous.” In other words, Tesla’s FSD beta is self-driving in name only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uTL6G0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tesla couldn’t say if the rate of improvement would make it to L5 by end of calendar year”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9losaY"&gt;(Al Prescott, associate general counsel at Tesla, was also involved in the December meeting with the DMV. Prescott has since left Tesla for LIDAR maker Luminar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqIkDF"&gt;Tesla and Musk have long been criticized for overstating the capabilities of the company’s Autopilot system, which in its most basic form can center a Tesla vehicle in a lane and around curves and adjust the car’s speed based on the vehicle ahead. The use of brand names like Autopilot and FSD has also helped contribute to an environment in which Tesla customers are misled into believing their vehicles can actually drive themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZGd5N"&gt;There have been a number of fatal crashes involving Tesla vehicles with Autopilot enabled. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;The latest took place in Spring, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, in which two men were killed after their Tesla smashed into a tree. Local law enforcement said there was no one in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash, leading to speculation that the men were misusing Autopilot. Later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;Tesla claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Autopilot was not in use at the time of the crash and someone may have been in the driver’s seat, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mQmTk"&gt;The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;both investigating the crash&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to dozens of other incidents involving Tesla Autopilot. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: you’ve only got a few more weeks to upload unlimited pictures to Google Photos for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TtIxvtarQWoUrN9nRsKMK-Coc5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69251716/1BEB77B1_EB2C_4E1F_A9C1_1B863908E956.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YBFsWJ"&gt;Google Photos’ free, unlimited storage is going away on June 1st — which means that you’ve only got a few weeks left to upload all your pictures and videos before the company’s new 15GB cap kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODAbiA"&gt;As the company had previously announced last fall, Google Photos’ beloved policy of allowing users to back up an unlimited number of  “high quality” photos and videos will be ending next month, replaced by a 15GB limit before customers will have to pay for more storage space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6RKQsa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Photos will end its free unlimited storage on June 1st, 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jDEzrm"&gt;But everyone gets to start fresh with that 15GB (minus whatever you’re already using with your Gmail and Google Drive accounts, which might be a lot for some users) starting on June 1st: anything you’ve uploaded beforehand won’t count toward that cap, meaning that if you’ve got a pile of pictures on your camera or hard drive, it’s a good time to upload them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFTfO3"&gt;There are a few catches, of course: the unlimited storage still only applies to “high-quality” photos, which are compressed down to 16-megapixel stills. Anything uploaded with the “original quality” counts toward your storage cap — although, unless you’re a Pixel owner, that’s already been the case for years, so that’s not much of a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXWcVr"&gt;Similarly, current Pixel owners — who get unlimited original quality pictures under the current policy, before getting downgraded to unlimited “high quality” pictures on June 1st — should take the rest of May to upload any pictures they haven’t put on Google Photos before the lower quality limit kicks in. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562908/google-future-pixel-phone-no-unlimited-photos-storage-confirmed"&gt;Google has already confirmed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that future Pixel phones won’t get the same perks, unfortunately.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IK68Tv"&gt;You can, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22286339/google-drive-storage-more-space-how-to-photos-files"&gt;always pay more for Google’s storage&lt;/a&gt; once June 1st comes along (prices start at $2 per month for an extra 100GB). But why not make the most of Google’s free space now before the deadline comes up?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These art collectors are making their own metaverse through games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAVqT7HLLxkMjXrZHtOePf7rqUQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69251656/ss_856dc0a7fdf8bffb04cff24a3c9176e628879ff5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Dslcollection is using technology to explore new ways to show off works of art&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5YicZt"&gt;Sylvain Levy just co-produced his first video game, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1499990/Forgetter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which launched on Steam on April 17th. Sylvain Levy has also never played a video game in his life. “I’m not kidding,” says the 67-year-old art collector on a Zoom call from Paris. “The three games that I know are &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; football game because my son plays it, and the &lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTQyic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt; isn’t Levy’s first foray into the digital world, but it’s his first time working with game designers. In this case, Hong Kong-based Allison Yang Jing and &lt;a href="https://www.kwanalan.com/"&gt;Alan Kwan&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an acerbic take on sanitizing creativity: the player works for a startup that scrubs dysfunction and trauma from dead artists’ brains and sells the clean brains to parents who want gifted, untroubled babies. While obliterating these intimate memories, you can also find real artwork by Chinese artists — all from Levy’s collection — and smash them into bits. It’s also a quasi-janitorial sim, so you get paid extra for vacuuming up the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIYZpR"&gt;After 10 months of development, Yang and Kwan made a walkthrough video of the game for Levy to watch. “I don’t think my hands are agile enough to be efficient in a game,” he says, turning over his palms. “But I love video games, and I love to look at people playing video games.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8sRTG"&gt;Levy isn’t just a collector. He’s a new type of video game patron, eager to explore what he calls our “digital twin” — our evolving online personae that have different appetites and behaviors. “It’s really important to understand that we have this double personality,” he says, especially as tech drives more human transformation. As digital spaces continue to define our post-COVID lives, the closer we come to what a metaverse could really offer. Commercial games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have long been pegged as forerunners for the idea of a shared virtual universe where we live, work, and play. But Levy’s work with games could spur deeper conversations about what we want (and need) in a metaverse that will inevitably be shaped by corporations and mainstream culture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfxBK6"&gt;In 2005, Levy and his wife Dominique created &lt;a href="http://www.g1expo.com/v3/dslcollection/"&gt;Dslcollection&lt;/a&gt;, an influential collection of Chinese contemporary art that never exceeds 350 objects. Their daughter Karen also helps run the collection, which includes work by Chinese art stars like &lt;a href="https://theallureofmatter.org/artists/gu-dexin/"&gt;Gu Dexin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/73-yang-fudong/"&gt;Yang Fudong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gagosian.com/artists/jia-aili/"&gt;Jia Aili&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gagosian.com/artists/zeng-fanzhi/"&gt;Zeng Fanzhi&lt;/a&gt;, and Ai Weiwei. The couple started out in fashion and has collected art and design pieces for the last “36 or 37” years. Things changed after Levy’s brother-in-law moved to Shanghai, inadvertently introducing the Levys to contemporary art in China and nudging the family business into a new era. “We said okay, since art is a mirror for society, let’s collect Chinese contemporary art and try to find the energy… we are experiencing in the city,” says Levy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZrIIE"&gt;Using the internet and YouTube, the Levys also decided to make their new collection public — something they’d never done before. As an early advocate of new technology, Sylvain Levy remembers making a Dslcollection iPad app at the end of 2010. “It was very funny when I was showing my app when walking into fairs,” he smiles. “The galleries were turning to me, ‘you don’t have enough money to print the catalog?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tu5VvbqtlT59x_bk3dNUsvi3_zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496666/ss_83f453bd2c3562bb238ad6958a05ee130b136c7c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgetter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jrsTtj"&gt;It wasn’t a far stretch for Dslcollection to reimagine how they wanted to share their art with the world. In 2009, they created a &lt;a href="https://rhizome.org/community/15150/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; museum&lt;/a&gt; with new media artists &lt;a href="http://lilyhonglei.com/"&gt;Lily and Honglei&lt;/a&gt;. A few years later came a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x5yNEdiFKA"&gt;virtual exhibition&lt;/a&gt; in a hacked re-creation of the Grand Palais museum in Paris, which required stereoscopic glasses to fully enjoy the artwork. And not long after that came &lt;a href="https://arts.vive.com/us/articles/projects/art-photography/the_dsl_collection/"&gt;virtual reality&lt;/a&gt;. “Very quickly, we learned that immersion and gamification were becoming very important in the experience of art, and especially with VR, we were trying to reach missing audiences,” Levy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U26fT4"&gt;When Allison Yang mentioned &lt;em&gt;Forgetter&lt;/em&gt;’s art “patron” to other game developers, they seemed surprised. Levy had initially approached her about a VR project, but she countered with the idea of a game. “A lot of people who might be either intimidated by a museum, or not interested in contemporary art, would be forced to see your art in a game without knowing it beforehand,” she told him. After working on a few demos, Yang and Kwan held monthly meetings with Levy, who also supplied part of the production budget. “[Sylvain] is a very bold person,” she says. “He gave us total creative freedom to do whatever we felt to be appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vq934m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were trying to reach missing audiences.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qM9RXN"&gt;Kwan, who has been making art games for almost a decade, sees this new patron-producer partnership as a potential financial model for experimental games. After all, public art funding isn’t a gold mine. “So what we are trying to do is explore, apart from crowdfunding, apart from getting a publisher, other alternative models to support experimental indie game projects,” he says. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-collectors-art-market-2021-report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; valued the global art market at around $50 billion. Of course, the fine art world is mostly a playground for the wealthy looking to spend money, and collectors like Levy are rare. But it’s thrilling to imagine a scenario where more progressive minds in the art world contributed their capital — financial, cultural, and otherwise — to the vision of a fuller and richer shared universe. (No, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t mean you.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUF14c"&gt;“We have deliberately chosen people not from the video game industry to make these games,” says Levy of his new endeavors. “When you look at [the games], you feel that this has been done by an artist, people molded by art or culture, and not only molded by technology or marketing. You can feel the soul… you can feel it’s done by people more related to the art world, than to the leisure industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTmePk"&gt;According to designer Calin Segal, Dslcollection is one of the first (if not first) art collectors to help develop games. Segal co-founded the multidisciplinary group &lt;a href="https://www.childrenofcyberspace.com/"&gt;Children of Cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;, which is working with the Levys on a game called &lt;a href="https://junethegame.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;June&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve seen...collections that have rented or borrowed artwork for video games, but it was always in the form of a gimmick,” Segal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGgmBQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;June&lt;/em&gt; traces the evolution of a child in cyberspace and will feature more conventional platforming elements. The game unpacks the artist’s journey of self-discovery, using everything from direct artwork scans and digital reproductions to hints of textures and visual Easter eggs. It’s also forged new connections between the game designers and the artists whose work is being featured. One of the team’s biggest inspirations is the performance artist &lt;a href="http://www.zhanghuan.com/"&gt;Zhang Huan&lt;/a&gt;, who was part of Beijing’s avant-garde &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/inside-a-vanished-hub-of-beijings-experimental-art-scene"&gt;East Village&lt;/a&gt; art community — a photograph of his discomforting piece &lt;a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/291672#:~:text=12%20Square%20Meters%20was%20a,during%20the%20heat%20of%20summer."&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 Square Meters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is part of the Dslcollection. The character of June will endure her own version of Zhang’s grueling performance, with his blessing. “[Zhang] is super open,” says Segal. “He’s the one who’s actually encouraging us to think more and more outside the box.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdwXDz"&gt;But it’s virtual reality where Levy seems most comfortable — he uses it at home, and it’s easy on his hands. It’s the most intuitive way to dip into the future while “staying human,” something that Levy believes will be the most difficult thing to do in a metaverse where millions of users interact in thousands of different ways. It’s even more vital to stay human as our current reality veers into dystopia. “If you look at what’s happening all over the world, the world is looking a little bit like &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt;,” he muses. “We have to bring back humanism in the core of all technologies… and the best way to do that is through culture, through art, and I do believe that more and more, art can be a way to counterbalance this new world which we’re entering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RbD1qApP8SobZbhwpeJg6oCE6IE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498375/m.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="29HB44"&gt;With his old &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; collaborators Lily and Honglei, Levy is now working on an &lt;a href="https://lilyhonglei.net/vr-art-village/"&gt;ambitious VR project&lt;/a&gt; to re-create the East Village, where several of Dslcollection’s artists honed their craft. Lily and Honglei considered several platforms for the VR Art Village: VRchat, Sinespace, and &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;/ Linden Lab’s Sansar, eventually going with Sansar for its capability to host several hundred people at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gKK1L"&gt;A short clip of the project shows a semi-armored virtual avatar jogging around a rural village on a cloudy evening. An abandoned cement factory looms large in the background. Players will be able to take part in events, watch live performances, and meet artists in the space. There’s even a transport system to get around. There will be artists’ workshops and storefronts — a barbershop and a bookstore — and a countryside school that houses a cinema, stemming from Lily and Honglei’s memories of growing up in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWKAjc"&gt;Beyond bringing the fine art world into one small corner of the metaverse, the VR Art Village is also a living homage to one of the significant periods in Chinese contemporary art history, of which little historical material survived. “To everyone’s surprise, systemic documentation about 1980s and 1990s society in China is surprisingly scarce and scattered, you just can’t find things,” says Lily. Born from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the East Village was a short-lived haven for political discourse through art in a particularly volatile era. “I think if we can provide the social context for the Dslcollection, that will be something special,” Lily says. “When you look at artwork in museums and galleries, they’ve somehow lost context with the society and environment which produced or influenced those artworks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rK2kxM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a fictional place that we have created to give meaning to our times.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lI7xPh"&gt;The designers are also opening up the village to the Grand Palais, which will have a sculpture garden for their collection. The ultimate plan is to keep adding more spaces and connect them together, and Lily eventually hopes to include the art community in New York. “This platform is a bit like the game of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,” says Levy. “I think this will be the next level, and we will release this platform by the end of the year.” Lily estimates that the village is about 70 percent complete; they’re just waiting for the art to arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSXiIW"&gt;Of course, art games and virtual reality experiments are not new. Independent designers have been working on their craft for years, often without the resources available to larger studios. But Levy’s enthusiastic embrace of games — small, experimental games made by tiny two-person teams — is a beacon for more artists and collectors to meaningfully participate in our shared digital universe, using the language of our times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8pTin"&gt;So far, popular perceptions of the metaverse are so vast, so intimidating, that only billion-dollar corporations like Facebook or Epic could afford to develop and implement the necessary infrastructure. As a distinctly commercial space,&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lets all our favorite celebrities and brands hang out together, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to the NFL and Major Lazer. At the end of the day, it’s all business — a business that will continue to thrive on gimmicks and cultural capital. But however our impending metaverse unfolds, it won’t be one monolithic, monocultural world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="fzp8GE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQCHNbwkihI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Upc6k2"&gt;“There’s always a bleak vision of how capitalists can manipulate things, but I still think there are some opportunities... like for Sylvain, a patron, to work with artists and designers like us, and to generate something interesting,” says Kwan. “Of course, the scale is much smaller, but I think they can still be interesting collaborations that make things work in between those two worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPxCRI"&gt;There’s plenty of room for artists to bring truth and empathy, even within the confines of a corporate or capitalistic world; some might even argue it’s an artist’s duty. “[The metaverse] at the same time is a real and an imaginary place, because what we consider the metaverse or cyberspace, at the end of the day, it’s a mythical land,” says Segal. “It’s a fictional place that we have created to give meaning to our times, and in the practical sense… it will never be a centralized system, but it will have pockets of resistance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6R8NdJ"&gt;For now, Levy’s vision for the family collection is an adventurous new conduit between fine art and games. He’s very happy if what he does encourages other art collectors to go into games and VR, not for the money, but to create humanistic experiences and bring fresh experimentation to a notoriously profit-driven space. “I’ve only had one principle,” he says. “It’s better to have a shop in the street where there are many shops, than in a street where nobody is. But we have to be the best shop in the street.” &lt;/p&gt;
