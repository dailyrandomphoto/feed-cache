    <title>Tesla allows drivers to play video games in moving cars, raising safety concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwCV64p7GydX-hI2pjeCNmL8oRY=/0x140:3341x2367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244439/IMG_0832.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJxKd8"&gt;Tesla updated its software allowing vehicle occupants to play video games on the center touchscreen while in motion, raising questions about safety and driver distraction. Previously, video games were only playable while the vehicle was in park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoGkWt"&gt;But according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an over-the-air software update was pushed out last summer enabling the ability to launch some games regardless of whether the car was stationary or not, raising serious concerns about safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8v2mEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the ability to play video games while the vehicle is in motion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ddgqmY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed in a Tesla Model 3 that &lt;em&gt;Sky Force Reloaded&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Solitaire&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Battle of Polytopia&lt;/em&gt; are playable on the center touchscreen while the vehicle is in motion. A notification asks the player to confirm they aren’t the driver before launching the game, but the message is hardly a deterrent. A driver could easily tap “I AM A PASSENGER” and play a complex action game like &lt;em&gt;Sky Force&lt;/em&gt; while in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying the warning prompt on a black background to confirm you are a passenger, allowing you to tap a button to continue the game." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4E5Ol-Le2meNHOodGTXhStJrVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071674/IMG_0834.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-check if you’re a passenger﻿&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BUYLPd"&gt;Some interactive apps in the car worked in motion even before the update, including the drawing pad and the Karaoke mode in music — which also warns the driver not to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RD8nUn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf9TAl"&gt;A Model 3 owner told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that he had filed a complaint to the NHTSA upon discovery of the games being playable while driving in his car. That complaint won’t be a first. Tesla currently has &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/AWD"&gt;59 complaints&lt;/a&gt; from owners regarding the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo6OMY"&gt;A spokesperson for NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-safety-agency-discussing-video-game-feature-with-tesla-2021-12-08/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was “discussing” the issue of playable video games in moving cars with the company. “Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. “We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying a video game running with a jet craft flying over an ocean, while also displaying the status of the Tesla vehicle in drive and running on autopilot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyfET7aS2WUCIt62fHZa8k-RSn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071692/IMG_0828.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Force running while on Autopilot. Don’t try this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9mX3H"&gt;Tesla has a reputation for regularly skirting safety rules and ignoring regulator recommendations for improvements. The company offers a version of its Level 2 advanced driver assist system called “Full Self-Driving,” which does not make its vehicles autonomous and requires drivers to stay vigilant while in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Wwdc"&gt;The US government has taken a renewed interest in Tesla, recently announcing that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSSz0"&gt;NHTSA is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;seeking more information from Tesla&lt;/a&gt; about the growing public beta test of FSD, the recently launched “Safety Score” evaluation process for entering the program, and the nondisclosure agreements Tesla was making participants sign up until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center display is showing a list of games in stacked squares that can be selected, and a button to play the game is visible on the screen though cannot be activated." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmJ1ASdjBz8EeB-dT7O0JKk9OoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071721/IMG_0831.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously released games like Cat Quest block the ability to launch the game while driving, a better way for Tesla to discourage unsafe behaviors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6mGj"&gt;Touchscreens in vehicles are quickly becoming the norm as manufacturers continue to remove tactile buttons and knobs from their vehicles. Many vehicles are becoming more dangerous as a result. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, drivers can get distracted and look away from the road for up to 40 seconds per task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HpDh0"&gt;Tesla has pioneered the use of over-the-air software updates in the auto industry, using smartphone-style updates to add features like improved driver assistance to silly Easter eggs like “James Bond mode” to its electric vehicles. The company has also rolled out a whole suite of video games it calls Tesla Arcade (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;we tried it out on a Model 3 back in 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3meHK9"&gt;Tesla has started using an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457430/tesla-in-car-camera-driver-monitoring-system"&gt;interior camera&lt;/a&gt; to monitor drivers for its Full Self-Driving beta program, which allows drivers to use automatic steering, lane-keeping, and adaptive cruise control on local, non-highway streets. But the vast majority of Tesla vehicles do not use any cameras to track driver eye movements to ensure they are keeping their attention on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Masahiro Sakurai on the future of Smash: ‘I’ve been doing too much of the work myself’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iG8jRTHYwWLgzAJGWcPHz1hllNU=/0x118:1339x1011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244366/Sakurai_pic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZsja8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; is finally complete. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;launching in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;a roster that included every single character from the series’ long history&lt;/a&gt;, it has since been steadily updated with new fighters, culminating in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;the addition of Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The game’s last major update &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/1466218355262697472"&gt;came on December 1st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIDzTg"&gt;Three years and countless charming video presentations later, series creator Masahiro Sakurai — &lt;a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/sakurai-on-smash-bros-ultimate-his-health-choosing-bosses-and-spirits-new-stages-much-more/"&gt;an infamous workaholic&lt;/a&gt; — seems to finally be taking it easy. “I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over email. That career has been tightly intertwined with &lt;em&gt;Smash, &lt;/em&gt;a series he has not only led but also been a key developer on for more than two decades.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other,” he says of his time working on the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fni5Sw"&gt;With development on &lt;em&gt;Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; wrapping up, there’s been much discussion on the future of the franchise — and particularly whether Sakurai would still be involved. I had the chance to ask the director a few questions over email, and we talked about working on new fighters, taking time off, and where &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5n7Dg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxlw7L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the game was first announced at E3 2018, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you told me how daunting the prospect of creating such a large roster was&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How did the post-launch development, and adding all of these new fighters, compare to that initial development process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62dN6i"&gt;You may have already noticed, but DLC fighters tend to be more uniquely made compared to standard fighters on the roster. Some sort of new in-game system is implemented, their Final Smash is accompanied by a visual sequence, they have a relatively elaborate stage setup and guests, and their battle tactics and in-game systems clearly set them apart from other existing fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl8sKW"&gt;Fans are paying extra for these additional characters, so we tell ourselves that we need to strive and do our best to deliver content that is more than worthy. Given that, adding one piece of DLC fighter and their accompanying stages, music, and other content proved to be a greater challenge than adding one piece of content in the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cov4Lp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that it’s finished, how does the final product compare to what you originally envisioned for the game? Are there elements you are particularly proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxpwj1"&gt;We envision the finished product and aim for that as we work on the game, so where we landed is certainly not too far from that initial vision. Even so, I feel that there are still some shortcomings, which I took as lessons learned. I have a feeling the notion of “being proud of” differs between Japanese and English, but I do not wish to boast about what we have accomplished with this project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="29iso0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. “&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3bUAXU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After working on it for so long, was it hard to finally step away from the game? What was it like when you realized work was complete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oGLGd"&gt;I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. This was a large-scale project that spanned many years, but even for a project like this, we still apply the same amount of effort to each step as with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s1Ehf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you managed to take any time off since Sora launched? What does a break for you look like (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1459390846709551112"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aside from riding horses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx26dx"&gt;Usually, I like to go on drives. I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development, so I occasionally go on short trips, overnight or just a day trip. My itinerary gets fairly packed since I like to make stops here and there. Also, it is fortunate that the COVID-19 situation in Japan has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKXxC9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever have regrets about not being able to work on projects outside of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; over the last few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ydSwd"&gt;I do sometimes look back and think about the fact that there may have been other opportunities had I not been working on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; However, I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other, and this was an opportunity that I could not have gained with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Moks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would convince you to come back to make another &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? Do you think, if you did return, your role would be different or reduced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XXd7m"&gt;I think we’ve reached the limit, at least in terms of volume of content and fighters. Basically, if I were to have the opportunity to work on another &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; game, that means we would have to shrink the roster, but we need to think about whether fans would be pleased about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVOTnx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The current ‘Super Smash Bros.’ has too much of my personality poured into it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo6vO1"&gt;Also, I’ve been doing too much of the work myself, so I’d need to resolve that, too. The current &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; has too much of my personality poured into it. In order for a long-time series to continue thriving today, we need to think about eliminating the series’ dependence on just one person’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxXQHy"&gt;Of course, this is the way it is now because we weren’t successful in splitting the vision between multiple people before. This would be a challenge for the future and something that needs to be discussed with Nintendo, if there were to be a next installment in the &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ5gAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07Z9W0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GTA Online’s next big update brings back Franklin and adds Dr. Dre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49uatkgJhC3aPXBvHyv_Zycqqzk=/117x37:1137x717/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244297/gta_online_contract.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CuByLA"&gt;Rockstar Games is releasing new story content for &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; featuring Franklin Clinton, one of the key characters from &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;. In lieu of releasing standalone single-player expansions, the company is &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51ko98182a41o9/introducing-the-contract-a-new-gta-online-story-featuring-franklin-cli?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_the-contract-20211208"&gt;weaving new story-focused missions&lt;/a&gt; into its massive online mode on December 15th. Despite what sounds like a more low-key approach, Rockstar seems to be going big with this one, including Dr. Dre’s likeness, as well as new, unreleased music from the legendary rapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3ZarM"&gt;The story apparently picks up in the years following the events that transpire in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;, and Rockstar got Franklin’s voice actor, Shawn Fonteno, to reprise the role. Aside from new missions, the content drop will include lots of new music. There will be a new radio station, as well as “huge first-of-their-kind updates to existing radio stations including a ton of new and unreleased exclusive tracks from Dr. Dre and a heavy-hitting line-up of artists,” says Rockstar. There will also be new side missions, weapons, and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cQKg3ve3CW9LnCui1kYzL-QJnJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23072822/gtaonlinedec15thupdate.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4K3ijH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dr-dre-new-album-detox-2021-grand-theft-1248754/"&gt;Snoop Dogg claimed that Dr. Dre was making music for &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; in late October&lt;/a&gt;. Many took that to mean it would debut at a much later date in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto 6&lt;/em&gt; (which itself has yet to be confirmed by Rockstar Games), but players will be able to listen to Dr. Dre’s latest songs sooner than they might have expected. This new content will arrive as a free update that’s available to all &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram head Mosseri to face questions about child safety in Senate hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7Hav0GIvwIV9pZjTigHfpX9FGY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244271/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5W6XR"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, head of Instagram Adam Mosseri will appear before a Senate Commerce subcommittee to answer questions about whether the photo-sharing app is harmful to children’s health. It’s Mosseri’s first appearance before Congress and the first hearing to specifically address Instagram separately from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li0m6S"&gt;The hearing, titled Protecting Kids Online: Instagram and Reforms for Young Users, will be &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/12/protecting-kids-online-instagram-and-reforms-for-young-users"&gt;streamed live from the Senate&lt;/a&gt; beginning at 2:30PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bECky1"&gt;Instagram has been the focus of growing concern from lawmakers and parents, following a bombshell &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Those documents suggested that Facebook was well aware that Instagram is “toxic” for its teenage users and that its algorithms could direct them to content that may encourage self-harm. Lawmakers have said they want to toughen child privacy laws, including updating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and are seeking broader reforms aimed specifically at Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QloKUN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parents ... have a right to know the truth about the safety of Instagram.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bcyvd1"&gt;In October, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding the company explain how Instagram plans to protect children. He later extended the invitation to Mosseri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbg0SJ"&gt;“Parents across America are deeply disturbed by ongoing reports that Facebook knows that Instagram can cause destructive and lasting harms to many teens and children, especially to their mental health and wellbeing,” &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf"&gt;Blumenthal wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Those parents, and the twenty million teens that use your app, have a right to know the truth about the safety of Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eD1Wo"&gt;Blumenthal has called for new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747330/snap-tiktok-youtube-facebook-papers-blumenthal-coppa-kids-child-safety"&gt;online child safety measures&lt;/a&gt; to address concerns around the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezwu63"&gt;Pressure is also mounting from anti-tech groups outside of Congress. On Tuesday, the Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/xanax-ecstasy-and-opioids-instagram-offers-drug-pipeline-kids"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; claiming Instagram’s algorithms are recommending drug dealers’ accounts to underage users on the platform. Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Instagram parent company Meta, said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/instagram-pushes-drug-content-teens-rcna7751"&gt;to NBC News&lt;/a&gt; that the platform does not allow drug sales, and that it would “continue to improve in this area in our ongoing efforts to keep Instagram safe, particularly for our youngest community members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhACCm"&gt;Concerns about Instagram became particularly relevant in March, when news &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; that parent company Facebook was planning a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;version of Instagram for children under age 13&lt;/a&gt;. Reaction was &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22385570/instagram-for-kids-youtube-facebook-messenger"&gt;swift and mostly negative&lt;/a&gt;, with public health experts urging the company to reconsider, &lt;a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/instagram_letter.pdf"&gt;saying in an April letter&lt;/a&gt; that such a platform would “put young users at great risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9ktBi"&gt;Facebook said in September it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;“pausing” work on the kids version of Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, with Mosseri insisting that the pause was not “a concession that the project is a bad idea.” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUU3AM9AaIx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;ig_rid=af386193-8761-41af-b94b-e78d8f4c528a"&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt; at the time that he believed “parents would prefer the option for their children to use an age-appropriate version of Instagram — that gives them oversight — than the alternative. But I’m not here to downplay their concerns, we have to get this right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HHAdk"&gt;Instagram has already made some minor product changes aimed at addressing concerns around unhealthy usage in advance of the hearing. On Tuesday, the platform rolled out the “Take a Break” feature it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;started testing last month&lt;/a&gt;, to users in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The feature prompts users to pause using the app after they’ve been using it for a certain time period. Take a Break is opt-in, but the company said a test of the feature showed that 90 percent of users will leave the reminders on once set. More parental controls over their teenagers’ use of Instagram will be released next year, &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/raising-the-standard-for-protecting-teens-and-supporting-parents-online"&gt;Mosseri wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post announcing the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPK2r1"&gt;Mariana Ruiz Firmat, executive director of nonprofit advocacy organization Kairos Action, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that she remained skeptical of Instagram’s motives. “They don’t want to move young people off the platform,” Firmat said, “because they’re making so much money from young people on their platforms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anfJ31"&gt;Firmat added that she’s not encouraged by any of the new regulations Instagram announced Tuesday and doesn’t see the Take a Break feature as all that impressive. “They’re looking at young people as a primary target for their profit margin, so it’s hard to imagine they’re going to really change anything right now,” she said. “The platform is way too enticing and addictive to young users.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku settles YouTube dispute and locks down apps in ‘multi-year’ deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44iguyJWJvPtvclOTEijl986rw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244236/DSCF3621_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cnZz6h"&gt;Roku has reached a deal with Google to continue distributing the YouTube and YouTube TV apps on its platform. The two had been at odds over a contract extension, sparring over what Roku described as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;onerous demands&lt;/a&gt; by Google for more data and more prominent placement on its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfIeay"&gt;If they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22820988/roku-google-youtube-december-9-deadline"&gt;hadn’t reached an agreement by tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, Google planned to pull the YouTube app from Roku — a loss for basically everyone involved, but especially Roku users who would have no longer been able to download a key video service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmEijN"&gt;“This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform,” Dallas Lawrence, a Roku spokesperson, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Google confirmed the deal to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and said both apps will be available through the Roku store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7cjso"&gt;Roku described the deal as a “multi-year extension” for YouTube and YouTube TV. YouTube TV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;pulled by Roku from its channel store&lt;/a&gt; in April as tensions between the two parties escalated. After months of stalled negotiations, Google said in late October that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;it would pull the YouTube app on December 9th&lt;/a&gt; if a deal hadn’t been reached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japanese billionaire launches to the International Space Station while waiting for SpaceX Moon ride</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RUSSIA-JAPAN-SPACE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwCPvg-FqlcAnj0wvEeP3fJ-RFI=/0x143:3716x2620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244129/1235877589.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(From L to R) Yusaku Maezawa, Alexander Misurkin, and Yozo Hirano&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by SHAMIL ZHUMATOV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNbe1u"&gt;Three new spacefarers launched to the International Space Station this morning, a crew consisting of a Russian cosmonaut and two Japanese space tourists. One of the tourists on board was Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;announced his intention a few years back to fly around the Moon on SpaceX’s future Starship rocket one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NxSdO"&gt;The trio lifted off on top of a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan at 2:38AM ET, docking with the space station around six hours later at 8:40AM ET. Maezawa’s crewmates include Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin and Japenese tourist Yozo Hirano, who is Maezawa’s producer and manager. The group is slated to spend roughly 12 days on the ISS before heading back to Earth on December 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GDJpzt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;part of Russia’s reemergence into the world of orbital space tourism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TysFHG"&gt;Their trip is part of Russia’s reemergence into the world of orbital space tourism. The flight comes just two months after Russia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709501/russia-soyuz-launch-actress-producer-filming-movie-space-station"&gt;launched a Russian actress and director to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; to film scenes for an upcoming movie called &lt;em&gt;The Challenge&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, Maezawa and Hirano are flying to the ISS through a partnership with Space Adventures, a company that brokers trips to space for interested tourists. The company helped orchestrate trips to the ISS for seven people in the early 2000s on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. However, it paused flights after the retirement of NASA’s Space Shuttle in 2011, as the space agency needed seats on Russia’s Soyuz rockets to get US astronauts and international partners to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WySRAk"&gt;With the help of Space Adventures, Maezawa went through training in Russia’s Star City to help prepare for his flight. Maezawa plans to film his time on the ISS with the help of Hirano and post videos of his adventures on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3gOWCjoz9aeXdSUt6Fhmw"&gt;his YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Before his flight, Maezawa also came up with a list of “100 things to do in space,” &lt;a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20211016/p2g/00m/0sc/014000c"&gt;according to Space Adventures&lt;/a&gt;. One of the items he hopes to do on his list is play badminton with Misurkin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yusaku Maezawa standing in front of a Falcon 9 rocket at SpaceX’s headquarters, ahead of his Dear Moon announcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zQmQyg"&gt;Maezawa, who made his fortune through an online fashion retail business called Zozotown, has already made his interest in spaceflight well known. The billionaire announced in 2018 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869990/elon-musk-spacex-lunar-mission-ticket-moon-passenger-bfr-falcon-yusaku-maezawa"&gt;he had purchased a trip around the Moon on SpaceX’s future Starship rocket&lt;/a&gt;, a vehicle the company is building to take people to the lunar surface and Mars someday. For that mission, dubbed Dear Moon, Maezawa plans to bring up to eight people with him along for the journey. Originally he had hoped to bring all artists with him, but in March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309546/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-dear-moon-spacex"&gt;he launched a contest to allow anyone around the world to apply to fly with him&lt;/a&gt;, “to give as many talented individuals as possible the opportunity to go.” Maezawa also announced plans in 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/12/21062584/spacex-yusaku-maezawa-japan-billionaire-starship-girlfriend-contest-moon"&gt;film a dating reality show to find a girlfriend to go to space with him&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114712/yusaku-maezawa-space-girlfriend-not-happening"&gt;that idea was eventually abandoned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUmtPJ"&gt;In July, Maezawa posted a video of some of the filmed applications sent to him by people who were interested in flying around the Moon with him. In the video, he said his team was in the final stages of screening to pick the finalists. Meanwhile, SpaceX’s Starship rocket has yet to fly to orbit. The company has flown prototypes of the rocket to high altitudes above the Earth and attempted to land them back on the ground. Only one of those prototypes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421845/spacex-starship-sn15-successful-landing"&gt;has been able to stick the landing without exploding afterward&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX is working toward its first orbital launch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da3iF2Np51A"&gt;in either January or February 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Even if that is a success, there are still plenty of milestones the company must achieve before it can safely fly people to the vicinity of the Moon and then land them back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZV8RB"&gt;With Starship’s timeline somewhat dubious, this trip to the ISS is a much speedier way for Maezawa get his space fix while he waits. Maezawa and his crew will join two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, and a German astronaut from the European Space Agency who are already living on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat is even more affordable today </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rikk4ve-Dbaex2opcFzYLFT5Tg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244108/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Alexa app to control Amazon’s Smart Thermostat, which is currently enjoying its first discount.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="85aJOu"&gt;Even without a discount attached to it, Amazon’s surprisingly great Smart Thermostat is a good deal in itself. After our reviewer spent a decade testing almost every smart thermostat since the launch of the Nest Learning Thermostat, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it to be one of the best yet. That’s saying a lot, and it’s pretty impressive given this is an affordable smart thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJWOjc"&gt;The thermostat is discounted for the first time today, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $47.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — a 20 percent discount on its typical $59.99. Built in collaboration with Honeywell Home, this gadget is capable of learning and adapting to your schedule, just like more expensive thermostats out there. With the price in mind, it does lack some features. Perhaps the most egregious omission is that it doesn’t integrate with platforms or voice assistants besides Alexa. Yet, if you’re looking for a good basic thermostat with which you can control the temperature of your home (even while traveling), this is definitely worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="took9t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0OPc"&gt;Sonos is offering great deals on its refurbished products through December 31st. You can buy, for example, the latest generation of the Sonos One for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeDeals120821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fone-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $100 less than its full $219 retail cost when purchased new. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16490866/sonos-one-speaker-review-alexa"&gt;first-generation&lt;/a&gt; is also on sale for $129, but lacks Bluetooth Low Energy support, has a slower processor, and comes with less memory than the second-gen. Meanwhile, the first-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt; soundbar is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8532386-11556673?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-white-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$259&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the price when purchased new. While it lacks Dolby Atmos support like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZAD3l"&gt;All of the discounted refurbished products will arrive in a box with the original accessories and cables. They’ve also been certified directly from Sonos, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. Each product also comes with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N3fELm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="TMUytT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDSO0B"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to bulkier headphones, you might want to grab the second-gen Apple AirPods at Amazon since they’re just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt;. That matches its second-lowest price after we saw the earbuds drop to $89 during early Black Friday sales. It’s also a lower price than what we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. Typically around $129, this model offers excellent wireless performance, reliable battery life, and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zVYh9F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y89YAm"&gt;If you’ve got a little more cash to spare, and you’re in the market for a pair of excellent over-ear headphones, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals120821"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling Sony’s WH-1000XM4 with Mophie’s Power Boost XXL 20,800mAh battery power bank for just $248. That matches the Black Friday and Cyber Monday price many retailers sold the $349.99 headphones for just by themselves. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95 itself, so this bundle is valued at around $390. Plus, the bundle also includes a small microfiber cleaning cloth to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6501a"&gt;As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; (and as you’ve probably read in our deals coverage many times before), Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM4 boast the company’s best noise-canceling capabilities yet. We gave the headphones a 9/10 partly because of it, along with their stellar comfort, sound quality, and the fact they also let you connect to two Bluetooth sources simultaneously (this was missing in the XM3). Meanwhile, Mophie’s portable power bank comes with two USB-A ports so you can charge your headphones and phone simultaneously, and it charges via Micro USB. The company claims as well that its 20,800mAh battery offers up to 77 hours of extra battery life, but note we haven’t tested this product, so we can’t confirm if this is truly the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfWTW"&gt;Of course, if you prefer to just buy the headphones by themselves, many are still selling them for just $248, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gyfQV3mV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="90yl6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezhNoP"&gt;Govee’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt; are fun, colorful lights that can make watching movies and gaming look more immersive. They sync to the colors on your screen (it supports 55- to 65-inch TVs) to make it appear as if its bezels have disappeared and the colors are expanding onto your walls. In other words, they’ll make for some pretty cool holiday gifts. Govee’s backlighting kit released in 2020 is back on sale at Amazon. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $63.99 once you clip the $20 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the product’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsGMEZ"&gt;Govee is also selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $62.99&lt;/a&gt; as a part of its holiday sale, which is a little cheaper. Still, if you prefer to shop from Amazon or are a Prime member, the Amazon deal could be the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="plsQMm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zH8SZ"&gt;For those still trying to nab a PlayStation 5 — or for those lucky enough to already have one — one of our picks for the best SSDs compatible with the PS5 is currently at its best price ever. Normally $229.99, Amazon is selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s 980 Pro for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169.99&lt;/a&gt; instead. That’s a $60 discount on Samsung’s blazingly fast SSD, which is one of the few kinds of drives on the market that meet Sony’s performance requirements. It’s also compatible with PC, though you’ll only get its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds if you have a compatible motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyhOxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="NPAcho"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PlayStation 5 will be available for Walmart Plus members on Wednesday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821037/ps5-playstation-5-restock-available-walmart-plus-queue-deal-sale"},{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VzJPoI"&gt;Shifting away from SSDs to gaming controllers, Razer’s Kishi is a great gift for gamers on the go traveling this holiday season. You can clamp it onto your Android phone and easily transform it into a Nintendo Switch lookalike. It’s also compatible with many games available on a variety of cloud-based gaming platforms, including Google Stadia, Microsoft xCloud, and more. It’s typically a bit pricey at $79.99, but right now both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9PMTEDGaM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are taking nearly 50 percent off, selling it for $44.99 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;If you’re an iPhone 12 Mini owner, Amazon is selling Apple’s black MagSafe leather case for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$23.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $59 — a 59 percent discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CUE8yB"&gt;Right now, PayPal is selling a $100 GameStop gift card for &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/gifts/brands/gamestopdecgood"&gt;$90&lt;/a&gt; that you can also use at ThinkGeek, EB Games, Babbage’s, and Planet X stores. It’s a good chance to save a little on a holiday gift or while treating yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OKgxx0"&gt;Amazon’s also offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/epicdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of deals&lt;/a&gt; on gift cards, like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vudu-Gift-Cards-Email-Delivery/dp/B09J7SKH8N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Vudu card for $40&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VUDU&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>How to keep some of your Twitter data away from advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KO2UsiRk_sylLL1GCQvDsU23Fq0=/1x0:2040x1359/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455393/VRG_ILLO_4902_SECURE_TWITTER.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can’t keep Twitter out of your data completely, but you can lessen the damage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HDn6QQ"&gt;In April 2020, Twitter began sharing more of your information with advertisers. Notice came via a rather weird notification that said “your ability to control mobile app advertising measurements has been removed” — which basically meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213593/twitter-data-sharing-pop-up-mobile-app-advertising-settings"&gt;Twitter was now sharing data&lt;/a&gt; such as which ads you looked at or interacted with, as well as the tracking identifier for your phone. Previously, you could turn that off — no longer. (Unless you live in the European Union or the UK, where there are extra protections.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter removed some of its privacy protections back on April, 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeS_u0XJB0UY1SerbX0c2VJ_59g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659847/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.25.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter removed some of its privacy protections in April 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrg9J2"&gt;While that protection has been removed, there are still a few privacy tools available that can give you at least some measure of say over how much of your data is shared with advertisers. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth it to take a few minutes to find them and turn them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXpKGc"&gt;There is a single page on the web where you can find a lot of the settings, called the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account/personalization"&gt;Personalization and data&lt;/a&gt;” page. Unfortunately, that page no longer seems to be available on the mobile app. So while we’ll initially discuss the settings as found on the web page, I’ll also tell you how to get to each feature on mobile. (To get to any of the mobile settings, you’ll always start by tapping on your personal icon in the upper left corner.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZZUCLB02fnkc5Cg51cBnkbMINI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025630/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses advertisers have to your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qtz9zr"&gt;Disabling ad personalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lVRFAY"&gt;On the “Personalization and data” page, you’ll find several advertising settings that give Twitter permission to “further personalize” your advertising by using information based on your “inferred identity,” location, or other factors. (Go ahead and read all the descriptions — they’re worth knowing about.) You can choose to enable any of these settings if you wish, but otherwise, use the toggle at the top of the page to disable all of the settings on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNsoti"&gt;If you’re using the mobile app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bou6OE"&gt;Find “Personalized ads” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Ads preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zJi3kO"&gt;Find “Personalize based on your inferred identity” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ajPoAd"&gt;Find “Personalize based on places you’ve been” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NZfBbK"&gt;Find “Allow use of where you see Twitter content across the web” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9vXMOx"&gt;Find “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Data sharing with business partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M6gpp3"&gt;Find “Personalize based on precise location” (which is not available on the web settings) by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="O5scKT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dayz7F"&gt;See your Twitter data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzZHy"&gt;If you’d like to go a little further, and check the other data that Twitter knows about you (and possibly remove at least some of it), go down to the bottom of the “Personalization and data” page and click on “See your Twitter data.” Check all of these topics out; you may be surprised by some of the info that’s there. Here’s a short summary of each (along with directions if you’re using the mobile app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e6mcaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account. &lt;/strong&gt;This is all basic stuff, like your name, age range, whether you have a verified account, and what other languages you speak. (I was amused to find that Twitter thinks I speak German. Okay, Twitter, whatever.) In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Account information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hwclF3"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account history. &lt;/strong&gt;This contains two separate areas: a listing of other accounts that have access to your account, and a listing of places you have been. It’s a good idea to check the former to see if there are any services that have access to your account and shouldn’t; you can revoke permission on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"&gt;Connected apps&lt;/a&gt; page. If you don’t want Twitter to know where you are or where you’ve been, use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location_information"&gt;Location settings&lt;/a&gt; to turn off access. In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OzGMLr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apps, devices &amp;amp; information.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sections here. “Apps, devices &amp;amp; information” is where you might find some of the devices and browsers that Twitter gets info from — assuming you allow it to. This is what Twitter meant when it asked to “Personalize based on your inferred identity” on the “Personalization and data page,” and it is one of the permissions that can be revoked there. The second, “Connected apps,” is another way to access several of the pages already mentioned here. This info can also be found in your mobile app under: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyjvtP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account activity. &lt;/strong&gt;This&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lets you see what accounts you’ve blocked or muted. On your mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Mute and block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLh0uFDEVnMduIatE8w4GIZbzT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025633/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Jnfnqh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interests and ad data. &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s a section you may spend a lot of time with, especially with “Interests from Twitter,” which tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity. If you plan on reviewing this thoroughly, put aside a few minutes: one of my Twitter accounts had 742 interests listed, including quite a few weird ones. As someone who has no interest in sports, I’d love to know how Twitter came up with “NBA videos” as an interest of mine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s8g5Hl"&gt;The other two categories here, “Inferred interests from partners” and “Tailored audiences,” can be disabled using the “Personalization and data” page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t find anything similar using the mobile app, but you can go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Content you see &amp;gt; Topics. There you’ll see some of the topics you’ve followed and that Twitter suggests you might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KeiiPf"&gt;Finally, “Download archive” lets you download the archive of your account history and activity. In your mobile app, go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Your account &amp;gt; Download an archive of your data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WcYWPm"&gt;Want to be really safe? You may want to just bite the bullet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete your Twitter history &lt;/a&gt;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Zylrk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 8th, 2021, 9AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on June 15th, 2021, and has been updated to accommodate changes in the web and mobile apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="080Iwj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create an NFT — and why you may not want to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkKWEwsQSLqb8kGv8XvL5IqIVVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244016/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fPTC9c"&gt;NFTs have been a cultural phenomenon throughout 2021, constantly making headlines as celebrities dabble in the space and as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;shenanigans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787216/miramax-pulp-fiction-quentin-tarantino-nft-lawsuit"&gt;legal fights&lt;/a&gt; ensue. With some creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;making millions off NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, though, it’s understandable why you’d want to try your hand at it or play around with the tech to get a better feel for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhOagU"&gt;We’re going to go over how to create an NFT using two of the most popular marketplaces, but before we get to that point, let’s cover some of the basics of what an NFT is and the decisions you may have to make before deciding to sell one. (If you’re relatively up to speed, you can go to Step 3 to begin the journey of actually creating a token.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H0qHxS"&gt;Step 1: Figure out what an NFT is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LraD0i"&gt;Listen, there’s no judgment if you’ve arrived here without much understanding of what NFTs are. Maybe a friend said, “Hey, you should sell that picture of your cat as an NFT.” But before you go through the process of creating and selling one, it’s probably best to have some idea about what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OnNA0i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MdUSlV"&gt;We have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;entire explainer going into NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and the culture around them, as well as an explainer on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;the blockchain technology that NFTs use&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t have to study every word in them, but the rest of this guide will make references to things like Ethereum, proof of work, and other similar concepts that you’ll get a better understanding of by reading our explainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aro9V1"&gt;Here’s a quick TL;DR, though. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital tokens stored on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies, where each coin is the same (there’s no reason to prefer one particular Bitcoin over another), each NFT is unique and can be sold as a way to prove ownership over some sort of digital file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3Dj6YF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFT artwork is almost never actually stored on the blockchain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GhUhwa"&gt;In almost every case, the files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;aren’t actually stored on the blockchain itself&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, a link to the file is stored, along with the token that acts as proof of ownership over whatever that link points to. There’s also no rule saying that two or more NFTs can’t exist for the same file — you can have NFTs with editions, kind of like trading cards. For example, an NFT can be rare because there are only 10 copies or common because thousands of the same NFT have been “minted,” or written to the blockchain. There’s also nothing to stop someone from taking the file you’ve used for your NFT and creating their own NFT with it (though the blockchain entry will show that it came from their account, not yours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuOLLp"&gt;You can technically sell any digital file as an NFT, but if you’re looking to use a marketplace’s easy minting tools, you’re going to be limited to the formats they support. We’ll touch on that a bit more later, but it’s worth keeping in mind that your first NFT should probably be an image, video, or audio clip of some sort. If you don’t know what you want to sell as an NFT yet, those kinds of restrictions could help you narrow down the possibilities. With that said...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RBq1rT"&gt;Step 2: Make sure you actually want to sell an NFT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZI5YKH"&gt;If you just have the vague idea that you want to make an NFT because seemingly everyone is doing it, there are a few considerations you may want to take into account. The first big one is transaction fees. While the platforms that we’ll cover today will let you create NFTs for free, selling them could be a different matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E34Y4R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can end up sinking a lot of money into the business before selling a single NFT&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2h8qL"&gt;Most NFTs are sold on the Ethereum blockchain (we’ll touch on ones that aren’t in the next section), and every transaction on the Ethereum blockchains costs fees that are paid to the miners. These fees &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp"&gt;are called “gas,”&lt;/a&gt; and the amount of gas you need for a transaction (and therefore how much that transaction will cost) can vary significantly. Almost everything you do on the blockchain, from minting an NFT to transferring it to someone else to bidding to purchase one, will cost gas (though there are some ways around this for creating NFTs, which we’ll go over in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxxKFQ"&gt;It’s also worth noting that paying gas &lt;strong&gt;does not 100 percent guarantee your transfer will go through&lt;/strong&gt;. You can pay more to give yourself a higher chance, but it is never a sure thing. To be clear, most transactions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; likely to go through. However, if something does happen and your transaction isn’t completed, you &lt;a href="https://legacy.ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit/"&gt;won’t get the gas fees you paid back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ttvg1"&gt;Then there’s the environmental aspect of NFTs. The most popular (and easiest to use) NFT marketplaces mostly run on the Ethereum blockchain, which uses an energy-intensive “proof of work” system (you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;more about what that means here&lt;/a&gt;). While there’s debate on whether individually selling NFTs &lt;a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/nft-carbon-environmental-impact-1234589742/"&gt;has an effect on the overall energy use of the blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, if your NFTs are built on Ethereum, you are making use of a system that has a big carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5monsi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The climate controversy swirling around NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="i0mPUZ"&gt;There are blockchains that use alternate systems that don’t use as much energy, and Ethereum has plans to move to a more efficient proof of stake system at some point in the future. However, that’s not the case yet, which is one of the reasons people might get upset when others decide to sell NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dq3EzB"&gt;Step 3: Choose a platform to sell your NFT on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1ftzWN"&gt;There are dozens of platforms that let you sell NFTs across a wide variety of blockchains, so it’s almost impossible for any single guide to cover them all, much less tell you which one is the right one for your project. We’ll be covering two of the more popular marketplaces in this guide, but do know that there are alternatives if neither of these platforms fit what you want to do, like &lt;a href="https://wax.atomichub.io"&gt;AtomicHub&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the Wax blockchain, or the &lt;a href="https://solsea.io"&gt;Solana-based Solsea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDP3mv"&gt;It’s also worth noting at this point that our guide will show you how to do things the basic way. Even with NFT markets, there are deep rabbit holes you can go down that won’t be covered in this guide (things like selling an NFT minted with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723092/opensea-nft-vulnerability-gift-security-researchers-wallet-hack"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; on Rarible, programmatically generating collections like Bored Apes, and so on). Just know that this isn’t meant to be a comprehensive compendium on selling NFTs — it’s just getting you to the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAVMFL"&gt;Both OpenSea and Rarible let you create NFTs on Ethereum without paying anything, thanks to what they call &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-collection-manager/"&gt;“lazy minting” systems&lt;/a&gt;. Lazy minting lets you create an NFT and put it up for sale without it actually being written to the blockchain, thus avoiding any fees. When someone actually buys it, the fees for writing your NFT to the blockchain will be bundled with the fees to transfer it to the buyer. That helps you avoid the situation where you pay $10 to $30 (or more!) to mint an NFT that no one ends up buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XXz9QA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it comes to minting NFTs, most options have some sort of trade-off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBVDns"&gt;There can be catches — with OpenSea, listing your first Ethereum NFT for sale &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500003246262-What-fees-do-I-pay-for-my-first-listing-"&gt;will require initializing your account&lt;/a&gt;, which can be an expensive transaction (during testing, I saw prices in the $300 to $400 range). It is a one-time fee, and after paying it, you’ll be able to lazy mint NFTs without having to pay anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0RyQd"&gt;With Rarible, I didn’t have to pay this sort of fee during my testing. However, trying to remove your NFT from sale will cost a fee (I saw prices around $20 to $30). Both Rarible and OpenSea will take a 2.5 percent fee from any sales you make — if you sell an NFT for 0.025 ETH, you’ll actually receive 0.024375 ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnal9w"&gt;There are, however, alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain. Rarible &lt;a href="https://rarible.medium.com/rarible-com-and-rarible-protocol-integrate-flow-blockchain-for-streamlined-nft-experience-80b624364c37"&gt;lets you sell NFTs using the Flow blockchain&lt;/a&gt; (the same one used by NBA Top Shot) if you sign up for it using the Blocto wallet, and OpenSea will &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404029357587-How-do-I-create-and-sell-NFTs-on-Polygon-"&gt;let you sell using the Polygon blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. Both options have much lower fees than those you pay for using the Ethereum blockchain, if any fees at all, so we will at least touch on using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQu0oT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heads up! The Polygon blockchain has nothing to do with &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.polygon.com" target="_blank"&gt;Vox Media’s gaming-focused outlet &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw8dOX"&gt;As you might have guessed, if there were no catches or downsides to these low / no-fee blockchains, everyone would be using them. At the time of writing, choosing to use Flow on Rarible will limit you to single edition NFTs (one of ones), and you won’t be able to sell them with an auction. Additionally, when you’re using non-Ethereum blockchains like Flow or Polygon, people &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012889322-How-do-I-purchase-NFTs-on-Polygon-"&gt;can’t use Ethereum to purchase your NFTs&lt;/a&gt; (at least, not without going through extra, fee-inducing steps). While both platforms do let buyers add funds to their wallet to complete a purchase, having to convert or outright buy another cryptocurrency to nab your NFT may put some collectors off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQEkpy"&gt;(Note: while Polygon does let you use Ethereum, it’s actually Polygon’s version of Ethereum. You can directly transfer Ethereum from its main blockchain over to Polygon and transfer back, but doing so will incur gas fees.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kREX7g"&gt;Do I have to use a marketplace site to create an NFT?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AZeRTt"&gt;Technically, no. You can &lt;a href="https://dzone.com/articles/steps-to-create-test-and-deploy-ethereum-smart-con"&gt;create your own smart contract&lt;/a&gt;, deploy it to the blockchain of your choice, and then mint your own tokens using it. That’s jumping into the deep end, though, and probably not the route you’ll want to go unless you’re very technical. Most people will want to use one of the platforms discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bvxeYQ"&gt;Step 4: Set up a wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lzoKda"&gt;Wallets are the applications you use to store your cryptocurrencies, as well as any NFTs you end up minting or buying. Coinbase has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Flearn%2Fcrypto-basics%2Fwhat-is-a-crypto-wallet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22809090%2Fnft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a more in-depth explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how wallets work and the different options that are available, but if you’re just getting started, there’s really one main thing you need to worry about: using a wallet that’s compatible with the blockchain you’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsyeCO"&gt;MetaMask’s wallet is one of the wallets that’s widely supported by Ethereum-based applications like OpenSea, Foundation, and others and can be used either as a &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; extension or as an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask/id1438144202?_branch_match_id=969078228885309776&amp;amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz00tScxNLM7WSywo0MvJzMvWL8529DB2SnSztAQA5G46IyQAAAA%3D"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;ref=producthunt&amp;amp;_branch_match_id=969078228885309776&amp;amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz00tScxNLM7WSywo0MvJzMvWT6ooz3a1yHeztAQA%2FOIqTSQAAAA%3D"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; app. Coinbase also has its own wallet that you can use as an extension or an app, and it’s supported by most platforms. You may want to consider Coinbase’s wallet if you’re planning on getting into crypto more broadly, as it has support for blockchains not based on Ethereum, like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WLbPF"&gt;MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet’s setup processes are similar. Once you have the browser extension or app installed (MetaMask can be &lt;a href="https://metamask.io/download.html"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase Wallet &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fwallet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22809090%2Fnft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), click or tap the “Create new wallet” button. Coinbase will ask you for a username, and both will ask you for a password, which you’ll want to make sure is secure (preferably by generating it with and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;saving it in a password manager&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cfTvZhiA6igBqhw06Q8plgIk-JE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069608/Screen_Shot_2021_11_30_at_16.51.49.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep your seed phrase as secure as you possibly can — both from prying eyes and the possibility of loss. Do not post it, even a blurred version of it, on the internet (as I am doing).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ur8ux"&gt;Finally, both MetaMask and Coinbase will give you what’s known as a “seed phrase,” which is 12 random words. It’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important not to lose this, as it will let you recover your account if you, say, uninstall the app or need to set up your wallet on a new device. It’s a good idea to copy it and store it in a very safe location, such as a physical safe or password manager (or both). MetaMask will ask you to repeat the phrase back, while Coinbase Wallet will ask you if you want to store an encrypted copy of it on the cloud if you set it up using the app. If you’re setting Coinbase up with the extension or you choose to manually back it up instead of saving it to the cloud, it’ll be the same process as MetaMask, where you’ll have to re-enter the phrase manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRa1AJ"&gt;If you lose your password and / or security phrase, you’ll be out of luck with both MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet — neither company can do anything to help you. That means you’ll lose access to any cryptocurrency or NFTs stored in that wallet, as well as the accounts that you’ve set up using it. So seriously, &lt;strong&gt;keep your password and secret phrase safe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suoJc4"&gt;Finally, you’ll have access to your wallet, which won’t have anything in it yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kd78Vw"&gt;Step 5: Connect your wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dKro9h"&gt;After you’ve got your wallet set up, you’ll want to connect it with the NFT marketplace you plan on using. OpenSea and Rarible make this easy — clicking the Create button in the top left prompts you to connect your wallet. You’ll then be presented with a list of compatible wallets, and choosing yours will prompt you to go through the connection process. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwroWfIAHTWnuNoOmbxEh0yM_Gk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069609/Screen_Shot_2021_11_30_at_16.54.11.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connecting an account with MetaMask is simple if you have the browser extension installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="busXzQ"&gt;If you have Metamask or Coinbase’s extension installed, you’ll see a pop-up asking you if you want to connect your wallet, which can be done with a few button clicks. If you’re using the Coinbase Wallet app, you can also connect to the marketplace by using the QR code scanner (which you can find to the right of your balance on the main wallet screen).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gxpOEBzgYNEjO05I01hqhLShk9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069622/Untitled_Project_5_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QR button in the Coinbase Wallet app lets you scan a QR code to connect to NFT marketplaces or other apps that require a wallet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z9bGoj"&gt;A word of caution for the future: be careful if you see a request to connect to your wallet when you don’t expect it, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723092/opensea-nft-vulnerability-gift-security-researchers-wallet-hack"&gt;scammers could be trying to access your funds or NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. As long as you’re on a trusted site, you should generally be okay (at least, as long as something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814849/badgerdao-defi-120-million-hack-bitcoin-ethereum"&gt;isn’t very wrong&lt;/a&gt; — be sure to check transactions to make sure they’re kosher). But if an unknown site asks to connect to your wallet, you should probably think twice before accepting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HufqcB"&gt;Step 6: Create an NFT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j87Fmz"&gt;After you’ve connected your wallet, you’ll arrive at the page you use to create an NFT (and if you don’t end up there, you can get there by clicking the Create button that both platforms put in the upper right-hand corner). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxWL1V"&gt;Before we start creating our NFTs, a word on collections — both platforms support collections, which are pretty much what they sound like. If you want to create a series of NFTs, you can use a collection to do so — on Rarible, you can create one right from the NFT creation screen, which the NFT you’re making will be added to. On OpenSea, you’ll have to go to your profile picture in the top right, then go to My Collections &amp;gt; Create a collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOChYA"&gt;We won’t cover collections in this guide, but OpenSea will automatically place the NFT you create into an unnamed collection if you don’t specify one (you can either edit the collection later or move the NFT to another collection), and Rarible lets you sell an NFT as a Rarible Single without a collection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCNUY3"&gt;Now, let’s finally get started on our NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e5ljot"&gt;Listing an NFT on OpenSea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jvqbMQ"&gt;After clicking the Create button, you’ll be brought to the create new item page. To start, click the box with an image icon in it, which will let you upload the file you’ll be selling as an NFT (though, do make sure to take note of the file size and type limitations noted above the selector). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mImeyM"&gt;After you’ve added your file, give it a name, or title. You can also use the External Link field to add a URL pointing to, say, your website or Twitter account, and you can use the Description field to give potential buyers a better idea of what your NFT is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_o3q2c2wCUBmrw6n-BFCVC7TdQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069597/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.12.12.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some file types, like videos or music, will ask for a second “preview” image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88mM63"&gt;Underneath those fields, you can choose a collection for your NFT if you’ve set one up, as well as add properties, levels, or stats that can basically act as metadata. If you’re selling an NFT that could act as a video game character, for instance, this is where you’d put in their information. If you’re selling a piece of art, you could use the properties panel to add information about it, such as the medium, year, etc. However, all these fields are optional, so a lot of people will probably be able to ignore them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpgi1e"&gt;OpenSea also lets you add text that acts as unlockable content, which the buyer / owner of the NFT will be able to see. You could use this toggle-able field to include something like an invite link to a private Discord, a code to redeem something on an external website, or even just a message thanking them for buying. You can also use the explicit and sensitive content toggle if your NFT is NSFW in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHAM78XaxMd7cJtilNz_Z7ezi9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069599/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.12.26.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure to pay close attention to which blockchain you’re minting on — you can’t change it later, and it could have a drastic effect on the fees you pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3HVUEJ"&gt;After those toggles and fields is the dropdown you use to select which blockchain you’re minting your NFT to — the Ethereum chain or the Polygon one. You can see Step 3 for more information on the pros and cons of each, but we’re going to go with Polygon for our example, as it &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404029357587-How-do-I-create-and-sell-NFTs-on-Polygon-"&gt;currently doesn’t require paying any fees&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re minting with Polygon, you’ll also have the option to mint multiple copies of your NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7X9JS"&gt;After you’ve chosen your blockchain, you’ll want to double-check everything. OpenSea lets you change the metadata afterward as long as you haven’t put it up for sale, but it’s good practice to make sure everything’s shipshape before doing anything blockchain-related. And note that you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be able to change which blockchain the NFT is on after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFR7zU"&gt;After you’re good to go, you can click the Create button. Depending on the options you’ve selected and what kind of file you’re selling as an NFT, there might be a bit of a wait as things upload. After it finishes, you’ll see a screen saying that your NFT was created.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiiDVNMNaOLFZZdjG5rUJ3_XUmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069596/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.17.15.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our NFT is on OpenSea but not written to the blockchain yet — that won’t happen until someone purchases it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aL9PdB"&gt;However, your NFT isn’t actually up for sale on OpenSea yet — to do that, you’ll have to click off of the congratulations screen to get to your NFT’s page (you can also get to it by clicking on your profile picture, clicking on the Created tab, and selecting the NFT). On the NFT’s page, there’ll be a Sell button. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VWR5dzyh8ZRo3iR38b_ipf4Hdo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069628/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_00.00.31.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This NFT has been created, but isn’t for sale — to list it, click the Sell button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YaGGNp"&gt;With NFTs listed on Ethereum or Polygon, you’ll have the option to create a listing for a fixed price, and on Ethereum, you’ll have the option to create a timed auction as well. For a fixed price listing, you’ll simply put in the amount that you want to sell the item for (listed in Ethereum, but it’ll give you an approximate dollar amount below) and choose how long you want the listing to be available for. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imEt8ti0WIYvOWZhbsfROVHjygc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23068156/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.20.38.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenSea’s Polygon implementation only supports fixed-price sales at time of writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KsmBG1"&gt;Since the NFT will be available to purchase as soon as you list it, you can also make it only available to a specific buyer using the “More options” dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj2AcP"&gt;To list your NFT for sale, click the “Complete listing” button. You’ll have to confirm, or sign, a few transactions with your wallet, either using the browser extension or the app. On Polygon, the transactions are free, and you’ll get a screen saying that your item’s been listed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fNSQJCN-TPLfllUDiODGd_L4vaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069594/IMG_3285.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example signature request in the Coinbase Wallet app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F5i0Z5"&gt;On Ethereum, if it’s your first NFT, you’ll have to do a one-time approval transaction to “initialize” your wallet, which we discussed above. To do so, you’ll need to have Ethereum in your wallet. Buying crypto could be its own separate explainer, but &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/how-to-buy-ethereum-a-beginners-guide-to-buying-eth"&gt;here’s a guide to get you started&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICra7f"&gt;The money for this transaction is only going towards gas, not a fee for OpenSea, so how much it costs depends entirely on how much Ethereum’s gas fees are at the moment. In my tests, I saw prices from around $240 to $450, so if it’s very high, you may want to wait until the price drops — you can use &lt;a href="https://ethgasstation.info"&gt;a site like Ethereum Gas Station&lt;/a&gt; to monitor transaction costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9k5NpF01ta1lH_dqZJTAeF8Dlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069595/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.29.35.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Registering to use Ethereum with OpenSea can be expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kGNOeV"&gt;After you’ve approved and signed all the transactions, your NFT will be listed for sale on OpenSea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hX5cp3"&gt;Listing an NFT on Rarible&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/duw1kGEIj4fhMwnWMskzv4O4z_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069629/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_00.02.11.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rarible starts you with an option right off the bat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TSgqDh"&gt;The first question Rarible will ask is whether you want to create a single-edition NFT or a multiple-edition NFT — in other words, whether you want to create a one-of-one NFT, or one that’s limited edition but can be purchased by multiple people. The screens you’ll end up on are largely similar (though you can only use Ethereum if you’re creating a multiple-edition, and you’ll have to specify the number of copies you want to sell), but for this example, we’ll choose single. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gcso5y"&gt;After choosing single on Rarible, you’ll end up on the NFT creation screen. The first thing to do is upload the digital file you’re hoping to sell as an NFT, using the Choose File button. Eventually, it’ll end up on &lt;a href="https://ipfs.io/#why"&gt;the InterPlanetary File System&lt;/a&gt;, or IPFS, which is a decentralized way to store media, making it so that your NFT won’t disappear off the internet if one company decides to stop hosting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugmQss"&gt;Like OpenSea, Rarible may ask you for a separate preview image for certain types of media, like videos or music — think of this as a video thumbnail or album art, which will display whenever your NFT shows up on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YT6us33UkNq_LlDScpdx8Mm-G8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067542/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.48.41.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rarible gives you a few options for how you’ll sell your NFT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YjB10M"&gt;Next, you’ll want to set your selling options. If you don’t want to sell your NFT just yet, you can flip off the “Put on marketplace” switch, which is on by default. If you do want to sell your NFT, though, you’ll have options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LNHdiz"&gt;“Fixed price” is like creating a store listing — you set a price for your NFT, and if someone wants to pay that price, they can just buy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="brazxJ"&gt;“Open for bids” lets people submit offers to buy your NFT, which you can either accept or reject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WnrI4m"&gt;“Timed auction” is an auction — you can set a minimum price and choose when the auction will start and how long it will last. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jBvx3z"&gt;For this example, we’ll go with listing our NFT for a fixed price, which we can enter into the field. You can also choose which currency you’d like to receive (people can, however, send offers in different currencies). When you’re setting your price, remember that Rarible will take 2.5 percent if your NFT sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUPeOr"&gt;After you choose your selling method and details, you’ll have the option to add unlockable content, which will be provided to the buyer. This could be something like an invite link to a private Discord, a code to redeem something on an external website, or even just a message thanking them for buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrfC5k"&gt;The next two options let you use choose your collection (we’ll go with Rarible Singles for our example), and the Free Minting option, which lets you choose whether you want to use Rarible’s lazy minting system, which we went over in Step 3. If you turn it off and are using the Ethereum blockchain, you’ll have to pay a gas fee to mint your NFT at the end of this process — when I was testing, the fee was around $120.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFN_zK5W8UTOmQL4yeqcJFRrAAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067546/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.49.15.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name and description will be important to help you stand out. Most people will want to leave the free minting option on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8m3aJs"&gt;You then give your NFT a name — or title — and a description if you want. Finally, you can choose the royalty percentage. This will change how much of each subsequent sale goes back to you in the future. For example, if someone purchases your NFT for 0.2 ETH and then sells it for 1 ETH in the future, you’ll get a percentage of that sale as well — by default, it’s 10 percent (so 0.1 ETH in our example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lY4abx"&gt;The last option is the Advanced Settings, which lets you add properties to your NFT (which is completely optional but could be useful if you were creating a series of characters with different properties) and alternative description text, which will help make your NFT more accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLlSsB"&gt;Double-check that everything is exactly how you want it, as it could be expensive or impossible to change later. Then, when you’re sure your NFT is good to go, click the “Create Item” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36O0g4K7iFD6MwFxExzJm_Ic14M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067549/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.58.25.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your wallet, in this case MetaMask, will ask you to sign a few transactions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FxJ4xv"&gt;Doing this will kick off a series of actions, during which you’ll have to approve some transactions with your wallet. If you’re using a browser extension, you should get a pop-up when Rarible asks for your signature (if not, you can click on the extension’s icon in your browser, and it should present you with any requests). If you’re using an app, you’ll want to open it on your phone, where you’ll be presented with the request.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_W9_a31bC-lrJN_UIyFgiJQ3cs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067551/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.58.31.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your NFT has been created!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4gZe4u"&gt;After approving a few wallet requests and a moment of waiting, you’ll get a message saying that your NFT has been created. You can click the “View NFT” button to see it, and you can see your collection by going to your profile picture in the top right and clicking “My Profile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1ZfUX"&gt;If everything’s gone well, you’ll now have an NFT listed for sale on either Rarible, OpenSea, or both. However, as sellers have told me, that’s not likely to get you very far — as you’ve seen, the process is relatively complicated, but the gold rush-esque environment around NFTs has led many to try their hand at making one. If you want your creation to actually sell, you’ll likely have to find some way to rise above the noise, either through snazzy marketing or making your art absolutely exceptional (and then probably doing some snazzy marketing). That task, however, I’ll leave in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNL0u5"&gt;PS: Don’t worry if your wallet has an NFT section, the NFT you made using this guide doesn’t show up in it. Your wallet reads entries from the blockchain to figure out what it should display, and lazy minted NFTs aren’t actually written to the blockchain until someone buys them — thus, they won’t show up in your wallet after you create them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos announces plans to make its products more efficient and repairable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A group of Sonos wireless speakers, including Arc, Sub, Move and One models taken on September 28, 2020.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLUygZKBxA8ruFWeWvJuzxjGR4E=/0x545:6017x4556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244008/1234776902.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qsCPX"&gt;Sonos announced plans today to make its speakers and other products last longer and use less energy. It’s part of the company’s larger plan to make itself more sustainable, with a focus on minimizing e-waste and the pollution that drives climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pe2VYp"&gt;A big part of Sonos’ new plans is to extend product lifespans by making its devices easier to repair and recycle.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This year, the company started a “Design for Disassembly” program that it wants to guide the development of all of its&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;new speakers starting in 2023. That includes changes like swapping out adhesives for fasteners, which can make it easier for consumers to take apart Sonos products for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wsxBFy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Minimizing e-waste and the pollution that drives climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci4Aev"&gt;There isn’t much information out on this program yet, however. When asked, Sonos did not tell The Verge whether it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will also make replacement parts and repair manuals available — details that will determine how repairable its products are in practice. But the program is intended to “make it easier to repair, refurbish and, eventually, recycle future Sonos products,” Deji Olukotun, Sonos director of policy and corporate social responsibility, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Biwkgk"&gt;The company also plans to start using post-consumer recycled plastic in all of its products by the end of 2023. This might prevent some plastics from winding up in landfills, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226655/microplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-ocean"&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;animals’ bellies&lt;/a&gt; — but recycling overall has been a pretty &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712435/recycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution"&gt;paltry solution for the world’s plastic pollution problem&lt;/a&gt;. Plastic degrades each time it’s re-hashed, which is why most tech companies have to mix recycled plastics with virgin plastics to make new products. That has some experts worried that a hot market for recycled plastics could actually lead to more demand for new plastics as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zO0aN"&gt;By 2023, Sonos says that all of its products will include “sleep mode,” a feature that cuts down on power consumption while the device is idle. Some companies already have sleep mode on their speakers,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but Sonos just debuted the feature this year on its Roam speaker. The goal is for Sonos products to ultimately use less than 2 watts while idle&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KhedUd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s biggest source of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ivCSDh"&gt;By making its speakers more energy-efficient, Sonos is tackling the company’s biggest source of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions. According to Sonos, about 75 percent of the company’s carbon footprint comes from the energy its products’ use over their lifetime. That differs from consumer electronics more broadly, of which &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/greener-electronics-2017/"&gt;up to 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; of CO2 emissions typically come from manufacturing, according to a report by Greenpeace. Between Sonos’ supply chains and consumers’ energy use, Sonos says it was responsible for CO2 emissions equivalent to 267,528 cars driven over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL4tlI"&gt;The company is setting more long-term goals for addressing climate change, too. It wants to cut emissions from its products’ energy use by 45 percent by 2040, and Sonos wants to essentially cancel its entire footprint by that date by relying on a mixture of carbon offsets and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;technologies that remove CO2 &lt;/a&gt;from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nirXcq"&gt;But offsetting climate pollution by paying for forests to naturally soak up carbon dioxide has a &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;checkered track record&lt;/a&gt;. And technologies capable of pulling CO2 out of the air haven’t scaled up to meet the needs of all the companies promising to use them to erase their legacy of pollution. That makes it all the more urgent for Sonos to focus on reducing its environmental footprint in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
