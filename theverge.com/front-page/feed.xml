    <title>Spotify is paying podcasters tens of thousands of dollars to buoy its own sponsorship tool</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Anchor promised to find sponsors for small podcasts, but Spotify is footing the bill&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GtV77X"&gt;John Newman is the type of person companies like Spotify want to get involved in podcasting. He has a niche interest — collecting sports playing cards — and is passionate and knowledgeable about the topic. When he went looking for a way to start his own show, &lt;em&gt;Sports Card Nation&lt;/em&gt;, in 2018, Anchor stood out. The podcast creation app, now owned by Spotify, makes it easy to record an episode, and it offers a novel feature for new podcasters: sponsorship opportunities for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voS030"&gt;What Newman didn’t expect, however, was that the main advertiser using Anchor’s sponsorship feature would be Anchor itself. Newman says over the course of two and a half years on the platform, he’s had only three sponsors through Anchor: Anchor, Pocket Casts, and a company called The Black Tux. One of those companies, Pocket Casts, didn’t even pay for its sponsorship, a source close to the company confirms — instead, Anchor covered its costs to promote the feature. Newman says both the Pocket Casts and Black Tux sponsorships lasted less than a month and netted him no more than $50 total. Anchor, on the other hand, has paid him around $2,500 to advertise its own service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReDBus"&gt;“It’s just a blip compared to Anchor,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1kdpgd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just a blip compared to Anchor.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gsq41H"&gt;Nine podcasters tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the same story: Anchor’s sponsorship feature seems to be seriously lacking in sponsors, and they’ve received few, if any, opportunities beyond Anchor or Spotify itself. Three people say they’ve earned thousands from Anchor and Spotify alone. Three also say they have now left or are looking to leave Anchor’s platform because they’re not receiving new sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZ883F"&gt;Anchor’s software is designed to let anyone start a podcast just by recording into their phone. It promised to help podcasters monetize those shows through a feature called Anchor Sponsorships, which launched &lt;a href="https://medium.com/anchor/introducing-anchor-sponsorships-the-podcast-advertising-platform-for-everyone-512870baa32b"&gt;in November 2018&lt;/a&gt; in the US, just months before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;Spotify acquired the company&lt;/a&gt; for $140 million. The functionality is akin to something like YouTube ads — advertisers are automatically matched with podcasts that fit their target demographic, and the hosts can then do ad reads for the sponsors and make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDmleC"&gt;It’s a radical idea, especially for smaller creators. Typically, advertisers only work with shows that reach tens of thousands of listeners. With Anchor’s approach, sponsors can distribute their ad impressions across many shows, rather than focusing on one or two in a specific network. The hosts can always pass on a sponsorship opportunity, too, if they’re not interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oyq0Kk"&gt;“We’re determined to level the playing field for podcast monetization by enabling new creators to get paid and new brand dollars to enter the market,” Anchor said when it announced the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="W1t2k5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smaller podcasters say they’ve lost their Anchor sponsorship in recent months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoI8MC"&gt;But it now seems that the grand vision isn’t panning out, and it may in fact be costing Anchor money to keep running. Sponsorships is becoming more of a marketing avenue for Spotify to entice new creators to join its platform and to keep them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxMg5I"&gt;Most of the podcasters &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with signed up for Anchor’s sponsorships feature last year and received Anchor itself as their first sponsor. They received $15 for every 1,000 people they reached. These podcasters say their Anchor sponsorships ended in the second half of 2020, and they weren’t offered a possible renewal date or a new sponsor to replace it. Three hosts say they only made around $50. Newman said his sponsorship briefly ended around three months ago, but he emailed with the company, and Anchor switched it back on at a different CPM, or cost per 1,000 listeners. It’s unclear why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxI7wy"&gt;Newman says he hasn’t had a sponsor other than Anchor for the past two years, even though his show has grown and now reaches anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 people per episode. He estimates Anchor has paid him around $2,500 over his nearly two and a half years on the platform. He currently still runs his Anchor sponsorship at a $17 CPM, along with other ads he obtained on his own outside of Anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oSmPWZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anchor is paying some podcasters thousands of dollars to advertise the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="emnIX1"&gt;Blake Chastain, a podcaster who creates two shows including one called &lt;em&gt;Exvangelical &lt;/em&gt;about “coming to terms with the messed up subculture of evangelicalism,” says both his shows lost their Anchor sponsorships last year. His spirituality podcast reliably reaches 2,000 or more people per episode, he says, while the other is nascent. He says he and five other podcaster friends haven’t been matched with a sponsor in months, since the Anchor sponsorship ended, and they’re now looking to move over to Megaphone, a hosting company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;recently acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOz4qh"&gt;Megaphone costs money to use as a hosting provider, but in exchange, it offers an &lt;a href="https://www.megaphone.fm/megaphone-targeted-marketplace"&gt;advertiser marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, which allows companies to have their ads inserted into shows that fit their target demographic, similarly to Anchor’s offering. Hosts don’t read the ads, however. The main barrier to entry is that Megaphone only offers its services to shows or networks with 20,000-plus listeners &lt;a href="https://www.megaphone.fm/pricing"&gt;per episode&lt;/a&gt;, which is why Chastain would have to coordinate with other podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D1dfF"&gt;“I feel like Spotify is well-positioned to offer things to indie podcasters, just as much as they are to develop their own in-house stuff by buying outlets like Gimlet, but it just hasn’t materialized yet,” he says. “So that’s sort of why when you’re smaller, you’re just doing stuff on your own, just sort of keep your options open. That’s why we’re exploring that [move to Megaphone].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="26D2bc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anchor wants to spread the wealth in podcast advertising, but money is seemingly only going to top shows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DqSmRs"&gt;Two other podcasters mentioned receiving sponsorships, in addition to Anchor’s own, including one for a sleep podcast called &lt;em&gt;Deep Sleep Sounds&lt;/em&gt; and one for Spotify itself. The podcaster who received the Spotify sponsorship, Dalton Trigg, says he and his co-host made $1,700 from Anchor and $900 from Spotify while on the platform for approximately a year and a half. They’ve since left Anchor and joined the Blue Wire podcast network with their basketball show, &lt;em&gt;Mavs Step Back&lt;/em&gt;, and use Simplecast for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIwLCy"&gt;“We made the switch because after nearly two years of having somewhat consistent ad money, we went two to three straight months at the end of last year where we had no sponsors at all,” he texted &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And the NBA offseason is our busiest time of the year for the pod, so that was frustrating for us — that it just all of a sudden cut off. Anchor support kept preaching patience and saying that they’d keep trying to pair us with new sponsors, but it got to the point where we had to make the move so we could continue to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSseMe"&gt;The fact that Anchor seems to be bankrolling its own sponsorship feature doesn’t bode well for Spotify, especially considering the critical role Anchor plays in the company’s growth strategy. Anchor offers its software and hosting service for free, which brings new podcasters into the field. It also beefs up Spotify’s own show catalog. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21755151/spotify-podcasts-anchor-stats-data-wrapped-2020"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Anchor launched 1 million new shows in 2020 alone and powers 70 percent of Spotify’s podcast catalog. Spotify has signed Anchor creators to exclusive deals, too, and a spokesperson said last month that 100,000 creators had generated revenue through Anchor’s sponsorships product to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SJdQOk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anchor Sponsorships is only available in the US, and 100,000 podcasters have made money through it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UwMGbt"&gt;Still, the situation all these podcasters depict suggests that while Anchor is attracting creators, it might not be making much money through selling advertisements. In fact, it’s seemingly just spending it. Plus, the success some of these podcasters have had in attracting outside advertisers demonstrates that once they reach a certain audience threshold, they’re sometimes willing to leave Spotify behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0zebh"&gt;We reached out to Spotify for information about which other advertisers currently use Sponsorships, as well as how much money the company has spent on these ads, but it declined to comment on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhdYH9"&gt;Spotify did put us in touch with the podcast &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone&lt;/em&gt;, however, which launched in March 2020 and is distributed through Anchor with most ads coming from Anchor Sponsorships. The hosts, Jason Stewart and Chris Black, say the majority of their ads market Spotify, Anchor, and Anchor-made shows. Spotify and Anchor have paid them “tens of thousands” of dollars in ad revenue in less than a year, they say. (They also host a separate, Spotify-exclusive show that highlights Anchor’s newest feature — the ability to include music in shows — called &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone Radio&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKZs5M"&gt;“It’s kind of like an interesting ecosystem,” Stewart says. “It’s like a garden that waters itself, as long as you have the good ol’ Spotify deep pockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAxBdH"&gt;They’ve had three other sponsors over the show’s existence that came from Anchor Sponsorships, including Manscaped, Solaray, and Roman. All three, they say, ran for around a month each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LctTNm"&gt;“It’s good to just be able to have that Spotify and that Anchor as your baseline to where even if you’re making a dollar a day off of it, or whatever, at the beginning, it’s nice to just see that,” says Stewart. “It’s kind of like gambling or something like that. You look into your wallet, and you get to see every day how much more money you’re making, and then it helps you kind of track your growth and your goals, and having Spotify and Anchor there throughout the entire time was an amazing foundation to build on top of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15vujx"&gt;Analysts at Citi &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/spotifys-big-bet-on-podcasts-is-failing-citi-says.html"&gt;sent a note&lt;/a&gt; to clients last week advising them to sell their Spotify stock, particularly because its podcasting endeavors hadn’t yet resulted in a meaningful uptick in premium subscribers or app downloads. Anchor has, so far, been a creation success story for the company. Even these podcasters, when asked, all say they don’t regret using the app and found it made podcasting approachable. Receiving money from Anchor didn’t hurt, either, and was like a cherry on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mC2V1T"&gt;But did Spotify enter the podcasting space to subsidize creators in making new shows, or to help itself make more money? Anchor’s sponsorship situation seems to be testing that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These wireless gaming earbuds deliver less lag but not much more</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Almost a great gaming gadget&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3jd5gG"&gt;The $199 GTW 270 Hybrid earbuds from audio company EPOS are, to my knowledge, the first truly wireless earbuds made for gaming — but the buds themselves aren’t the biggest selling point. The USB-C Bluetooth receiver that comes with the earbuds gets that distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPafR5"&gt;It’s much more compact than the standard flash drive-sized USB dongles included with many headsets. It’s more capable, too, operating with the aptX low latency (aptX LL) codec that delivers good-sounding audio with no perceivable lag. Using the receiver, the GTW 270 Hybrid can be especially great for fast-paced games where sound cues count for success; but really, it’s nice to have for any title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5srGRy"&gt;However, there is one problem: the microphones don’t work when you’re listening to audio via the USB-C receiver. (The earbuds’ built-in microphones do work, however, when they’re paired to a device via Bluetooth.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORFC4K6Lezv5xKvsviZb60aZ_6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247792/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the star of the show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qbrj5B"&gt;This falls more on the technical limitations of aptX than EPOS’s decision-making. In an effort to prioritize bandwidth for sound quality and responsiveness, only the playback channel is active when you’re listening using the USB-C dongle. That’s a potential deal-breaker for some gamers who might want to be able to jump into a voice chat with friends on their consoles. But to EPOS’s credit, the latency between the dongle and the earphones &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;does seem&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzjl72"&gt;These gunmetal-colored buds have a simple, understated design so that they don’t poke out too much from your ear. They aren’t too heavy, and the fit is comfortable, thanks to swappable silicone ear tips that help to get a good seal in your ear. As for controls, they have just a single multifunction button that handles pausing and resuming music, changing tracks, as well as picking up phone calls. In other words, without the USB-C dongle, these aren’t that special. (EPOS does make a $169 version sans dongle.) For general use — such as phone calls or music — you can get more by spending less if you check out some of the options in my colleague Chris Welch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;affordable wireless earbud buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pcSqcm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10294264"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7EfIqn"&gt;Outside of gaming, these earbuds can be used like any other wireless set to connect to your phone, tablet, or laptop via Bluetooth. They support Bluetooth 5.1 (with the SBC or aptX codec, depending on the device you connect to) for music, videos, games, and phone calls, and EPOS says you can pair them with up to eight devices. Pairing is done by holding down the button on the charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-2LUh-JKNl-S0bF430gIO1vIbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247789/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GTW 270 Hybrid’s only button is on the left earbud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c3R2Rt"&gt;Speaking of the charging case: it has an all-metal design that’s unfortunately very easy to scratch. It charges via USB-C; with a full charge, EPOS says it can deliver up to 15 hours of extra battery life to the earphones. During the review period, the GTW 270 Hybrid earbuds made it to the five-hour mark for battery life, which matches the company’s claim. And if you’re someone who goes on the occasional sweaty jog or just doesn’t want to get caught in the rain, these are IPX5 water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYhNVH"&gt;I’ve spent the past few weeks using the earbuds to play games alternately on my PS5, my Switch, and my work laptop several times each day. (In case you’re curious, there’s an adapter included that lets you plug the dongle into a device that has USB Type-A ports.) The GTW 270 Hybrid works like any wireless gaming headset, but the truly wireless form factor has some obvious advantages. I like that they let me move around uninhibited by wires, and using them doesn’t isolate me (or mess up my hair) as much as bulky over-ear cans. The receiver is pre-paired to the buds, and they connect almost instantly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__j7V3C7h9-P_C1JzfzGzEAB-b4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247791/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each earbud charges via contact points, and the LEDs indicate remaining battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nRmKDf"&gt;I also love the convenience of being able to use just the right earbud (the right one controls the Bluetooth transmission, so listening through the left earbud alone doesn’t work), so I can keep an ear available to listen for packages being dropped off. This, of course, is nothing new for people who already use truly wireless earbuds. It just feels new to experience this freedom with a gaming headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2bp8q"&gt;I sampled the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remake, 2018’s &lt;em&gt;God of War, Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;, along with a few other games, during the review period. While they don’t have the widest soundstage or the clearest frequency separation I’ve heard for listening to music, they shine with game audio — in particular, with surround sound effects and bass delivery. The overall sound quality isn’t explosively robust, and there’s a limit to how immersive the surround sound effects can be, given the earbuds’ small drivers. But the sound isn’t too compromised. Unless you’re a hardcore gamer who needs to hear every detail in crystal-clear presentation, these will likely suit you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8f0cSVrV14pGvIeyGcmkhA82cYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247793/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These work gloriously with the PS5 as well as the Switch. A USB-C to USB Type-A adapter is included to expand compatibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PXUK2C"&gt;The GTW 270 Hybrid would be very close to ideal if the microphones worked while connected using the USB-C dongle. Alas, they don’t, so using the dongle will be next to useless for those who frequently play multiplayer games with friends. (It’s a slightly different story if you play lots of single-player games and don’t mind not having a microphone for gaming.) Since the earbuds are not all that useful for gaming without the dongle, that means you’re making a big compromise, and it’s one that none of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy#:~:text=Best%20wired%20gaming%20headset%3A%20Bose%20QC%2035%20II%20gaming%20headset&amp;amp;text=Despite%20costing%20more%20than%20an,and%20wired%203.5mm%20connectivity."&gt;best gaming headsets I’ve tested&lt;/a&gt; (most of which are cheaper than this) ask you to make. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pebble founder promises iMessage on Android and Windows with universal chat app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1wZFTB046HpKA-ZWB_QfputIBo=/0x0:1715x1143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698998/msedge_cx5MYIw6nR.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s website promises “a single app to chat on iMessage, WhatsApp, and 13 other networks.”&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: BeeperHQ.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vJaaDX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.beeperhq.com/"&gt;Beeper&lt;/a&gt; is a new universal chat app that’s an attempt to unify 15 different chat platforms into a single interface. The app is the work of a team that includes Eric Migicovsky, the CEO and founder of former smartwatch manufacturer Pebble, who announced its launch on Twitter. Beeper’s site notes that the project was previously known as NovaChat, and requires a $10 per month subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3OMhW"&gt;Although Beeper integrates with world’s most popular messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Slack, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, it’s the support for Apple’s iMessage that’s perhaps most interesting. iMessage is only officially available on Apple devices, and it’s often cited by users as something that prevents them switching to Android. Migicovsky says Beeper should allow iMessage to work on Android, Windows, and Linux, but admits that it’s “using some trickery” in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7mXgX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And yes, iMessage works even on Android, Windows and Linux using some trickery :)&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351932357201154048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUzzv"&gt;An FAQ on Beeper’s website gives a more in-depth explanation of exactly what this trickery involves. If you’ve got an always-online Mac, then you can install the Beeper Mac app to act as a bridge, similar to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/imessages-on-android/"&gt;the approach AirMessage uses&lt;/a&gt;. But things get really wild if you don’t have access to a Mac, at which point Beeper says it’ll literally send each of its users a “Jailbroken iPhone with the Beeper app installed” in order to act as a bridge. At this point we should probably mention that using Beeper involves paying a $10 a month subscription, which may or may not include the cost of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5nS9e"&gt;Just in case you thought Beeper was joking, in a followup tweet, Migicovsky said that he currently has 50 old iPhone 4S’s at his desk, ready to be upcycled for use with Beeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DZqpVf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fQ960gU7Xm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fQ960gU7Xm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351936829017083906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcLez"&gt;If the workaround works as Beeper claims, then the result should be a universal chat app that works across MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, offering a unified inbox, and the ability to search across messages from each of the 15 services. It’s built on the open source Matrix messaging protocol (Migicovsky &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#315f:~:text=The%20only%20downside%20to%20Matrix%20is,the%20waiting%20list%20to%20use%20it."&gt;previously described&lt;/a&gt; NovaChat’s relationship to Matrix as akin to Gmail’s relationship with email), and although the client app itself isn’t open source, the bridges connecting it to other chat services are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbZT0G"&gt;Oh, and there’s a dark mode coming in Beeper’s next update, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3taZS3X_tQWFDqp5nn7mbulfSZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249728/6006a93e8082353374b0cd22_beeperSearch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeper&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s interface can include chats from multiple different services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W4JSXX"&gt;While the short-term aim is to make it easier to chat to people across different chat apps, eventually Migicovsky has talked about the prospect of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#e362:~:text=These%20bridges%20are%20actually%20just%20an,need%20for%20bridges%20gradually%20over%20time."&gt;everyone using Matrix itself&lt;/a&gt; to chat with friends and colleagues, rather than simply using it as a bridge between services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOpjih"&gt;Although Migicovsky says he’s been using Beeper as his default chat client for the past two years, it doesn’t appear to be widely available just yet. Instead, Beeper asks prospective users to fill out a form on its website for an invitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpXTUd"&gt;Here’s the full list of chat services that Beeper currently supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WXWYqb"&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qxrw5I"&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vQZ1eg"&gt;iMessage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Phn8Xh"&gt;Android Messages (SMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wa0ikm"&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5dL2i7"&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZnJXG"&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XyQ9da"&gt;Hangouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QvDOmp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="vIljWB"&gt;Signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSr2xk"&gt;Beeper network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Apple’s first VR headset reportedly includes a fabric design, a fan, and expensive price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--mchtKKykT_pIeLMrTf_7Q5150=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698961/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZTva7"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a VR headset that will include a fabric design, a fan, and an expensive price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first VR headset may launch as soon as 2022 as a standalone device that operates through batteries, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on “some of its most advanced and powerful chips” for this unannounced VR headset, with some chips reportedly beating its own M1 Mac processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjaoPC"&gt;Apple has reportedly faced challenges in the development of this headset, with some prototypes ending up too big and heavy. Apple is reportedly using a fabric exterior to reduce the headset weight, but the company is also using a fan — an unusual move for Apple given its emphasis on fan-less design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6dJgivAt5zzei_su0CSzE_T_Fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21869421/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 VR headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tii31X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the size of Apple’s VR headset, which is codenamed N301, is similar to the Oculus Quest, and some prototypes being tested include external cameras to enable some AR features. Apple is also reportedly testing the ability to use these cameras to track hand movements, and include software features like a virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tT2Mk"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when Apple’s VR headset will launch, but it could be as soon as 2022. It will reportedly be an expensive and niche device, with some at Apple rumored to be anticipating that the company may sell only one headset per day at each of its retail stores, or less than 200,000 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frWB0X"&gt;Apple has been working on VR and AR headsets for years, according to various reports. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;detailed look at Apple’s VR and AR ambitions&lt;/a&gt; last year, noting that the company has around 1,000 people working on AR and VR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Linux has been ported to run on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-IpwDW3GHZj5o-3J6zhfJoB6t0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698905/vpavic_4291_20201113_0326.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tKNyW"&gt;A new Linux port allows Apple’s M1 Macs to run Ubuntu for the first time. Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing, has successfully ported Ubuntu over to M1 Macs and released a tutorial for others to follow. The modified version of Ubuntu boots into the regular user interface and includes USB support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yav1NU"&gt;The team at Corellium have &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;detailed exactly how&lt;/a&gt; they managed to get Ubuntu running, and it’s a good in-depth read if you’re interested in the details. While a number of M1 components are shared with Apple’s mobile chips, the non-standard chips made it challenging to create Linux drivers to get Ubuntu running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtsFHk"&gt;Apple hasn’t designed its M1 Macs with dual-boot or Boot Camp in mind. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;has previously ruled out official support&lt;/a&gt; for natively booting alternate operating systems like Windows or Linux. Virtualization seems to be Apple’s preferred method, but that hasn’t stopped people from making their own ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eFKgh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Linux is now completely usable on the Mac mini M1. Booting from USB a full Ubuntu desktop (rpi). Network works via a USB c dongle. Update includes support for USB, I2C, DART. We will push changes to our GitHub and a tutorial later today. Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CorelliumHQ&lt;/a&gt; team ❤️  &lt;a href="https://t.co/uBDbDmvJUG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uBDbDmvJUG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Wade (@cmwdotme) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v56Gaz"&gt;Hector Martin, a developer who regularly gets Linux running on a variety of hardware, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1333459867323957251?s=21"&gt;also porting Linux to M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;. Developers seem to be enticed by the performance benefits offered by Apple’s M1 chips, and the ability to run Linux on a silent ARM-based machine. “I’ve been waiting for an ARM laptop that can run Linux for a &lt;em&gt;long &lt;/em&gt;time,” said Linux creator Linus Torvalds &lt;a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=196533&amp;amp;curpostid=196570"&gt;back in November&lt;/a&gt;. “The new Air would be almost perfect, except for the OS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz7P96"&gt;Corellium CTO Chris Wade describes this new port as “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008"&gt;completely usable&lt;/a&gt;” on a Mac Mini M1, and it works by booting the full Ubuntu desktop from USB. You will need a USB-C dongle to get networking working, though, and the process to get the port running will require some familiarity with Linux and custom kernels. Corellium has posted a &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;tutorial on the process&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in trying this beta project out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmANmX"&gt;Corellium has some experience in working around Apple’s operating system protections. Corellium offers security researchers a virtual iPhone to help with vulnerability exploration. It’s a process that has angered Apple enough to file lawsuits against Corellium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205130/apple-corellium-dismissed-copyright-dmca-fair-use"&gt;Apple lost an early challenge&lt;/a&gt; against Corellium late last year, after initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;filing a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the company on copyright grounds back in August 2019. Apple later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;alleged DMCA violations&lt;/a&gt; in January 2020, and a judge dismissed the copyright infringement claims in December. A ruling on the separate DMCA allegations has been deferred.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter locks out China’s US embassy after ‘baby-making machines’ tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UyByA7wbJWkCFf5PN-MTBqnQmWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698794/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTzSVD"&gt;Twitter has locked the official account for China’s US embassy, over a tweet it said violated its policy against dehumanization, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/twitter-locks-out-chinese-embassy-in-u-s-over-post-on-uighurs?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The tweet, which was originally shared on January 7th, referred to Uighur women as “baby-making machines” prior to government intervention. Twitter removed the tweet and replaced it with a notice saying it’s no longer available. However, Twitter requires account owners to manually delete tweets that violate its rules before unlocking accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7NcFA"&gt;Twitter confirmed the account’s locking in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “We have taken action on this Tweet for violating our policy against dehumanization,” and said the platform prohibits dehumanization of a group of people based on their “religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, or ethnicity.” As of this writing, the last tweet from the Chinese Embassy in US account was from almost two weeks ago on January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6XUc3AXOSIUlZJaFi8Tx7IFrXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249693/msedge_mbKakxD6xa.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Twitter.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jan 7th tweet is no longer visible on the account, but must be manually deleted for the account to be unlocked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xqyQJ"&gt;China has faced fierce criticism of its treatment of minority Uighur Muslims living in the Xinjiang province, with critics alleging that it is forcibly sterilizing Uighur women. The United Nations estimates that as many as 1 million Uighurs may be held in camps in the region, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. On Tuesday, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China’s treatment of the Uighurs amounts to “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/19/mike-pompeo-china-uighur-genocide-sanctions-xinjiang"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwvTss"&gt;At a briefing in Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the embassy was “puzzled” by the account lock, and said the embassy was attempting to correct “fake reports and information related to Xinjiang.” In tweets that are still visible on its US page, the Chinese Embassy has shared reports and infographics relating to population growth and its policies in Xinjiang. The embassy joined Twitter in 2019, as part of a broader effort by China to counter criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4HrlK"&gt;Twitter has previously been criticized by former President Donald Trump and his allies who claimed the social network was unfairly targeting Republicans while allowing foreign governments to violate its policies. In May 2020, in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;warning labels being placed on his tweets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52846679#main-heading:~:text=Twitter%20is%20doing%20nothing%20about%20all%20of%20the%20lies%20%26%20propaganda%20being%20put%20out%20by%20China%20or%20the%20Radical%20Left%20Democrat%20Party.,Until%20then%2C%20it%20will%20be%20regulated!"&gt;Trump claimed&lt;/a&gt; the social network was “doing nothing about all of the lies &amp;amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXUO4l"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52846679"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter had previously removed a tweet by Iranian Leader Supreme Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and suspended accounts associated with Cuban President Raul Castro and members of his government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uplxpd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RAwhJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is mass-producing 90Hz OLED screens for laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csL2IYbtyWjz_9k55HsnJzN7_38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698695/mchin_200402_3957_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung’s 2020 Galaxy Chromebook. | Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZSazv"&gt;Samsung Display has announced plans to mass-produce the world’s first 90Hz OLED screens designed for laptops and says that “several global IT companies” are expected to release models with the new panels this year. Manufacturing will begin in March in “very large quantities,” the company says in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210120005673/en/Samsung-Display-to-Introduce-First-90Hz-OLED-Laptop-Display/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; attributed to CEO Choi Joo-sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwwynE"&gt;The panels are 14-inch in size, though Samsung Display hasn’t given details on specs like aspect ratio or resolution; it’s possible that there will be multiple versions available. Samsung does cite the faster response time of its OLED panels, claiming “practically” the same amount of blurring as a 120Hz LCD when displaying fast-moving content. No potential laptop OEM partners were named in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9WOr5"&gt;OLED displays aren’t unheard of in laptops, but they’re not at all commonplace. While quite a few gaming laptops offer them as an option, the tradeoff there is that you’ve had to give up on high refresh rates. And despite Samsung itself launching an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;OLED-equipped Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; last year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;2021 followup&lt;/a&gt; uses a cheaper QLED-branded LCD display instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="il4SQ9"&gt;Samsung is the world’s biggest vendor of OLED display panels, so the announcement today suggests that OLED laptops are likely to become much more of a common sight this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden cancels Keystone XL permit</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Demonstrators rally near Trump Tower while protesting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline on February 4, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. President Donald Trump had recently signed executive actions to advance approval of Dakota Access and the Keystone XL pipelines, undermining efforts by the administration of President Barack Obama to block their construction. | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ii95so"&gt;In one of his first actions in office, President Joe Biden issued an executive order on a broad range of environmental protections that included stopping construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. This is the second time a president has pumped the brakes on the embattled pipeline. Barack Obama denied a permit for the project in 2015. Then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15047936/trump-keystone-xl-pipeline-decision-climate-environment"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Donald Trump reversed that decision and issued a permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AzaMvE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Back on the right footing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2bnTd"&gt;The order directed federal agencies to review environmental rollbacks made under the Trump Administration, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-cancel-keystone-xl-pipeline-permit_n_60076208c5b6df63a91abf63"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/biden-executive-action.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That includes revisiting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;fuel efficiency standards&lt;/a&gt;, and the boundaries for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16735910/trump-national-monuments-utah-bears-ears-grand-staircase-escalante-cuts"&gt;Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;national monuments.  It also temporarily halts oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofcRFr"&gt;Gina McCarthy, national climate advisor, said Biden’s moves “begin to put the U.S. back on the right footing, a footing we need to restore American leadership, helping to position our nation to be the global leader in clean energy and jobs,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20210120-on-day-one-biden-to-sign-orders-reversing-trump-policies-on-climate-virus-immigration"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmnkNa"&gt;830,000 barrels of crude oil were expected to flow through the $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline every day. In an apparent last-minute attempt to get the project in Biden’s good graces, on January 17th, the company said it would spend $1.7 billion to purchase enough renewable energy to match the pipeline’s power consumption by 2030. Keystone XL developer TC Energy suspended work on the pipeline today and said in a &lt;a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2021-01-20-tc-energy-disappointed-with-expected-executive-action-revoking-keystone-xl-presidential-permit/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it is “disappointed” with Biden’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W9fOQ"&gt;For more than a decade, Native American tribes, activists, and environmentalists have fought to stop the 1,210-mile-long pipeline from being built. Obama backed away from the pipeline just before the adoption of the Paris climate agreement, &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/06/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that approving the project would do little for the US economy and would instead undercut US leadership on climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZAUC9"&gt;The pipeline continued to face opposition and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18078490/keystone-xl-judge-blocks-construction-2018-montana-judge"&gt;legal challenges&lt;/a&gt; after Trump gave it the green light in 2017. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation &lt;a href="https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/"&gt;filed lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against the administration. They say that the administration failed to consult with the tribes and that the pipeline poses a danger to their lands and water sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oZv5O2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Activists are pushing Biden to stop the construction of other pipelines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YdfR9A"&gt;This is just one piece of Biden’s plan to transition the US away from fossil fuels driving the climate crisis. The climate change plan he developed while on the campaign trail includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; to get the US to “100 percent clean energy” by 2050. Biden also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;recommitted the US to the Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt; today, a global pact to avoid that tipping point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpicB9"&gt;Activists are pushing Biden to stop the construction of other pipelines, &lt;a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/keystone-xl-is-out-dakota-access-next-2oGuwLyth0K5eVjG2Uy8-g?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=107179902&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwARR-m4TSrWXeUUAb1t1GoL749iT55M57TVGJHEMVRzw7JaRX4VmbxmrZMc4KuW7LWTT4HMlPqQ9nfkl4QJ-xysQufbAtb5kC4PdCzGFS1iB4z4&amp;amp;utm_content=107179902&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;including the Dakota Access pipeline&lt;/a&gt; — which Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14373858/trump-executive-order-dakota-access-keystone-xl-pipelines-dapl-nodapl"&gt;similarly expedited&lt;/a&gt;, despite high-profile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/4/13836744/dakota-access-pipeline-halt-standing-rock-army-corps-engineers"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; in defense of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s water supply and land. There are also calls to stop the Enbridge Line 3 project, a plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356423/oil-gas-pipelines-abandoned-enbridge-line-3"&gt;abandon an aging pipeline&lt;/a&gt; that runs between Alberta and the Midwestern US and replace it with a new one that can transport more oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dkqKN"&gt;“Suspending one big oil expansion project through Native territory and approving another is the opposite of climate leadership and respect for Indigenous sovereignty,” Tara Houska, a citizen of Couchiching First Nation Anishinaabe and &lt;a href="https://grist.org/briefly/meet-the-fixer-this-lawyer-stands-with-indigenous-activists/"&gt;prominent attorney&lt;/a&gt;, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.wecaninternational.org/PressReleases/Indigenous-Women-Call-Upon-Biden-to-Stop-Pipelines-and-Uphold-Indigenous-Rights-in-the-Wake-of-Escalating-Climate-Chaos-and-Covid-19-Crises"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; penned by Indigenous women leaders on January 14th. “The Biden administration can uphold their climate justice claims by acting to Stop Line 3, Stop Keystone XL, and Stop Dakota Access Pipeline, now.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook gave the first Mac Pro to Trump, apparently</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W169Jq"&gt;Tim Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18253785/donald-trump-tim-apple-cook-ceo-name"&gt;as Trump once called him&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t just give Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;the opportunity to lie about bringing an Apple factory&lt;/a&gt; to the United States. He also gave him a $5,999 Mac Pro, according to Donald Trump’s final financial disclosure report today (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidenrich/status/1352055331376025601"&gt;the NY Times’ David Enrich&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bSjHr"&gt;The computer is described as the very first Mac Pro produced at the Flex Factory in Austin, Texas. That’s also a lie: that factory has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/21/14037030/apple-made-in-america-failure"&gt;actually been producing Mac Pros since 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4h0qLS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Check out the gifts that people –– including the CEOs of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boeing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ford?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; –– gave Trump. (from his final financial disclosure report, released today) &lt;a href="https://t.co/nJYwiIxvAB"&gt;https://t.co/nJYwiIxvAB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/WiZP5HZ3EJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WiZP5HZ3EJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Enrich (@davidenrich) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidenrich/status/1352055331376025601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXNzKx"&gt;Either way, $5,999 would actually make it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/10/21003636/apple-mac-pro-price-most-expensive-processor-ram-gpu"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; expensive version of the 2020 Mac Pro the company currently sells&lt;/a&gt;... with no monitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/3/18651001/apples-mac-pro-xdr-display-monitor-stand-expensive-dongle-not-included-wwdc-2019"&gt;no stand for that non-existent monitor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004965/apple-mac-pro-wheels-optional-cost-price-400"&gt;no $400 wheels&lt;/a&gt; to help Trump lug it out of the White House. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us developers explain why new features are taking a while</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Among Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vOvYEy1zOhxwra3u0GFn1K4QW6c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68697640/ss_a0f2416e11bf5b47788eaa3617e092b73962b145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Innersloth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zZmieB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was one of the smash hits of 2020 — it reportedly had nearly half a billion players &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; — and there are some exciting updates announced for the game, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168243/among-us-innersloth-new-map-airship-early-2021"&gt;new airship map&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/03/among-us-will-soon-get-player-accounts-and-a-massive-new-map/"&gt;account system&lt;/a&gt;. In a blog &lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/202874/the-upcoming-airship-map-consoles-and-whats-next-"&gt;posted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, developer Innersloth discussed how it has adapted in response to the game’s enormous popularity and why new features are taking a while to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dt7Hp3"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; gained incredible traction pretty late into 2020 that we weren’t expecting, and that meant A LOT of change for us,” the developers said. Innersloth, which is comprised of just four employees, had to spend two months restructuring, figuring out processes, and working with new external partners, according to the blog. “It’s all behind-the-scenes work, and while it meant time away from the game, it’ll make it easier for current and future us to develop the game better,” Innersloth said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFiiBf"&gt;The studio has also juggled bringing the game to new platforms — it hit Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt; and is coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S consoles &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/among-us-coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc/"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iubiOk"&gt;There’s a lot to look forward to, though. The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ixfokUG711U"&gt;airship map&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled to come out in early 2021, has new tasks to complete as well as ladders and floating platforms for traversal. Innersloth aims to launch the account system “ASAP” with a focus on moderation. And the studio plans to share a public feature roadmap at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
