    <title>Xbox games aren’t opening for some in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOS0d2"&gt;Xbox games aren’t opening or launching for many across Europe today, with an error message being presented instead. “The person who bought this needs to sign in,” says the error. The issues started at around 1PM ET, and Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live-status"&gt;aware of the problems&lt;/a&gt; and has marked the outage as “major.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAwU6V"&gt;The problems appear to be related to the Microsoft Store, which is also preventing some Xbox owners from purchasing games right now. Microsoft says it’s working on the issues, but it’s not clear when Xbox owners will be able to launch games or access the store again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="blyZof"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;if you're having problems launching Xbox games in Europe right now, you're not alone &lt;a href="https://t.co/uFswmohMnT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uFswmohMnT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1390360674224721922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MinMOv"&gt;The rest of the Xbox Live, or Xbox network, service appears to be functioning, with Party Chat, LFG, and other parts of Xbox still accessible. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362975/microsoft-teams-xbox-live-down-outage-issue"&gt;Xbox Live last went down last month&lt;/a&gt;, alongside an issue with Microsoft Teams. Microsoft blamed the previous issues on DNS problems, but today’s error message suggests there’s an authentication problem somewhere preventing some Xbox owners from accessing their digital games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use YouTube’s gestures to make it bearable on a portrait-locked phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q307eboRfSUaBnFCcv-HVqoUQxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69247427/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAzW1U"&gt;If you use your phone in portrait lock all the time, it can be frustrating trying to get YouTube videos into full screen with the tiny button in the UI. Thankfully, there’s a better way, using the app’s built-in gestures: you can simply swipe up on a video to fill up the screen and swipe down on it to go back to portrait orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pT3nco"&gt;We’ve actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534349/youtube-mobile-app-gestures-swipe-full-screen-closed-caption-autoplay-buttons-update-new"&gt;written about this feature before&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like it’s easy to miss; most of the people I’ve shown it to had no idea it existed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDRctFnkzboC5cruqwsHWl-1woY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496515/DSCF2152_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VEAmmz"&gt;Of course, this feature works on Android phones as well, which I personally like better than having to hit the auto-rotate button built into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8vMAO"&gt;There is one obvious limitation: it only rotates one way. If you want to hold your phone with the left side facing up, you’re out of luck unless you turn portrait lock off. Still, it’s way better than having to tap on the video once to get the UI controls to show up, then trying to hit the tiny full-screen button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZws6q"&gt;Now all we need is this feature to be added to every other app (or for our phones to get smart enough to realize that if I’m watching a video and turn my phone, I probably want to see the video in full-screen, despite portrait lock). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack introduces publication sections for newsletters so writers can ‘grow their media empire’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Substack logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BPaApKRSBvwD-Ny__4Kvb02e_HE=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69247307/Untitled_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lROx7G"&gt;Newsletter publishing platform Substack has &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/new-sections"&gt;introduced publication sections&lt;/a&gt; for its newsletters, which will allow writers “to create and manage multiple newsletters or podcasts within a single main publication,” the company announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0WUQT"&gt;“As your publication grows, you might start to expand what you offer to readers,” Substack explained in a blog post. “For example, you may want to add a separate section for a podcast series, for regional or topical content, or for posts in other languages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZtOCU"&gt;Subscribers can opt in or out of receiving emails for each section. “We’re excited to build more tools that give writers the flexibility to grow their media empire and give readers more agency over what they read,” the blog post states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUfzHe"&gt;Substack CEO Hamish McKenzie &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b9fea53-db83-4cd4-a9bd-10af24aebfea"&gt;described to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; what the new sections might look like: “Maybe you have something on politics for example, and something on sports, and something on religion within the same publication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiCaNa"&gt;Sections aren’t quite a new concept in publishing; many news sites (including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) are usually divided into sections, like tech, science, entertainment, and so on. And before online news sites had sections, newspapers were divided by topic into sections like sports, business, and local news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVEimz"&gt;For those who may not have been following the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html"&gt;news business&lt;/a&gt; as closely as those who are working in it have, online news sites (and the internet in general) are &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/09/what-will-happen-when-newspapers-kill-print-and-go-online-only-most-of-that-print-audience-will-just-disappear/"&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt; for killing newspapers, and there’s been much handwringing &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/04/substack-media-new-york-times-subscriptions-poaching.html"&gt;over concerns&lt;/a&gt; that email newsletters will kill online news sites. Of course, there are &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/14/fast-facts-about-the-newspaper-industrys-financial-struggles/"&gt;plenty of other reasons&lt;/a&gt; newspapers are in decline, but Substack re-creating what is essentially the format of a newspaper is kind of a journalism &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros"&gt;ouroboros&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwOxKy"&gt;And Substack, backed by prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, has been on a tear of late, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/business/media/substack-newsletters-journalists.html"&gt;enticing numerous prominent journalists&lt;/a&gt; with generous bonuses and the promise of greater control over what they write and how they connect with audiences. And Andreessen Horowitz led a &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-andreessen-horowitz-newsletter-36cb98ea-a7b3-43b1-883a-fa45586eaad4.html"&gt;$65 million funding round&lt;/a&gt; for Substack last month, valuing the company at about $650 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esuX9c"&gt;But newsletters that focus on individual creators like Substack and Revue are just one part of the push to get into people’s inboxes; they’re also a big part of how traditional publishers reach their 21st century audiences. Their long-term impact on the news business is still to be determined. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Play’s app listings will require privacy info next year, just like the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJZYiSdA6imu06rXsmq1w0rJMGg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246451/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5pKPQT"&gt;Starting next year, apps on Google Play will show details about what data they collect, as well as other information about their privacy and security practices, in a new safety section in their listing. The announcement comes just a few months after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;started displaying similar privacy information in the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. In the same way Apple’s policy covers both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165959/apple-privacy-nutrition-labels-all-apps-preinstalled-messages-web"&gt;its own apps&lt;/a&gt; and those developed by third parties, Google says its first-party apps will also be required to provide this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIoZrd"&gt;According to Google, the initiative is meant to “help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security.” The section will detail what user data an app has access to (like location, contacts, or personal info like an email address), but Google says it also wants to let developers give context to explain how it’s used and what it means for their apps’ functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r3DBDTG4A_HKRhrJEmQysPpwf94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496255/PrivacyLabels_AdditionalGraphic_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s timeline for introducing the new policy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6kjkoh"&gt;In particular, Google says apps will give information about whether data is encrypted, whether they comply with Google’s &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/families"&gt;policies around apps aimed at children&lt;/a&gt;, and whether users can opt out of data sharing. Google says the information will also highlight whether a third party has verified the app’s safety section, and whether users can request that their data be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s06MWX"&gt;The new policy won’t come into effect for several months, and Google says this should give developers enough time to implement the changes. It says developers will be able to start declaring the new privacy information in the fourth quarter of this year, and that this will start being shown to users in the first quarter of 2022. New apps and app updates will be required to include these new privacy details from the second quarter of 2022, and apps that don’t could eventually see their updates being blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPVW6u"&gt;This new initiative to provide more information about data privacy and security follows Google’s recent announcement that it’s overhauling how apps are allowed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411560/google-play-store-listings-scammy-emoji-deals-misleading-assets-guidelines-policy"&gt;present themselves on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. Although an exact enforcement date is yet to be announced, eventually app listings won’t be allowed to use tricks to try and make themselves excessively eye-catching, like writing words in all-caps, or using emoji in app names. Google says more information on the new policies will arrive in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZsmcH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is trying to make Assistant more useful for your family this Mother’s Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pu2p7DX53-aDxGxmlACnZ3EudDM=/0x62:422x343/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246447/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_8.35.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xlai29"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/plan-perfect-weekend-new-google-assistant-features/"&gt;Google is announcing&lt;/a&gt; some improved Assistant features for families, including improved broadcasts, new bells, and some new stories that can be read to kids. Google says it’s rolling out the features for Mother’s Day, but a few of them could be useful for everyone, not just moms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQDm9H"&gt;The first is an expansion of its Broadcast feature, which lets you send messages to Assistant devices in your house. Using Family Broadcast, messages will now show up on your Family Group’s phones as well, which your family members can reply to. For instance, if you wanted to tell everyone to be quiet when they come home because you’re taking a nap, they’ll now be able to get that message outside of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oxuH7GE7cIerwP7Cmi0qZbNyl-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496171/Copy_of_google_mothers_day_3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting Family Broadcasts on the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1YxwUs"&gt;Google is also adding new reminders to its Family Bell feature, which lets you set up recurring reminders for your family. Google now lets you automatically remind your family that someone needs to water the plants or remind your kids (or spouse) to clean up the house, just in time for spring cleaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFVz9A"&gt;Assistant is also getting a few more entertainment features, from &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; stories that will start appearing this weekend, stories about real-life heroes like Jane Goodall or Ruth Bader Ginsburg for smart displays, and an &lt;em&gt;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&lt;/em&gt; game for the Nest Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEEUpl"&gt;Google also hints that there’s an Easter egg or two included in the rollout: it hints that you should try setting a timer on Mother’s Day. (I can’t imagine what the surprise will be, but my interest is piqued.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 now has a YouTube TV app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25Ntq96TzeZMldyEVsk0uaDDiOo=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246380/vpavic_4261_20201023_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxBn52"&gt;The PlayStation 5 &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129767#zippy=%2Cmobile-devices-computers%2Cstreaming-media-players-smart-tvs-game-consoles"&gt;now has a YouTube TV app&lt;/a&gt;, arriving more than six months after the console launched. That means anyone lucky enough to actually buy Sony’s latest console now has another way to watch live TV on it, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/05/youtube-tv-arrives-on-ps5-just-in-time-to-pick-up-ex-roku-viewers/"&gt;as first spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MSOBJ"&gt;YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;costs $64.99 per month&lt;/a&gt; (not counting additional extras) and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7286228?hl=en"&gt;allows up to three simultaneous streams&lt;/a&gt; within a household, which could be useful if your PS5 is hooked up in another room from your main TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5pLr1"&gt;Having another device that works with YouTube TV could be especially helpful for Roku owners, given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;ongoing feud between Google and Roku&lt;/a&gt; that has seen YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;removed from Roku’s channel store&lt;/a&gt;. (That means new Roku owners can’t install or re-download the app if they don’t already have it on their device.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOOF1t"&gt;Admittedly, the Venn diagram of “PS5 owners who subscribe to YouTube TV and also own a Roku device that didn’t already have the YouTube TV app” is certainly vanishing small. But in a world where corporate disputes can mean losing access to the services you pay for on the devices you already own at the drop of a hat, having more streaming options is never a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scrap new gas infrastructure, says UN report</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FGOIKc"&gt;A major new United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-methane-assessment-benefits-and-costs-mitigating-methane-emissions"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; makes it extremely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;clear that relying on natural gas won’t help the world avoid climate catastrophe. Once seen as a “bridge fuel” that could provide a less-polluting alternative to coal and other fossil fuels, growing &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/186"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that gas is a bigger culprit in the climate crisis than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAifgZ"&gt;Though it’s been attractively&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;branded as “natural” gas, the fuel is primarily plain old&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;methane. When burned, the fuel does&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;produce less carbon dioxide than coal and oil. The problem is that extracting so-called natural gas and bringing it to homes and buildings leads to a lot of methane leaks. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, with more than 80 times more power to warm the planet than carbon dioxide &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;especially in the first couple decades after it’s unleashed on the atmosphere. In fact, methane has been responsible for nearly a third of global warming that’s already taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6USWjt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CPRkmU"&gt;Human-caused methane emissions will need to drop by 45 percent this decade in order to avoid worst-case climate scenarios and meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, the United Nations report warns. Expanding natural gas consumption and infrastructure would jeopardize those targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPny5T"&gt;“One thing the report calls for very strongly is not building any more of this fossil fuel infrastructure,” Drew Shindell, lead author of the report and a professor at Duke University, said in a press conference. “When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KrN6EX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How your gas stove sparked a battle over climate change ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j6aboI"&gt;Fortunately, achieving those methane cuts is affordable and possible with existing technology, according to the report. For starters, fossil fuel industries need to do a better job of preventing leaks. But that alone won’t be enough. In the long run, keeping the current fossil fuel infrastructure would derail efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. And while emerging technologies that capture carbon dioxide from polluting power plants might do some good, “there are multiple risks that this technology will not work, will be too expensive, and/or will have so many side effects that society will not want to use it,” according to the report. Bottom line: the report calls for a sweeping transition to renewable energy, which it says would “remove the bulk of methane emissions” in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW0qwj"&gt;Agriculture and waste are other sectors with major methane footprints, making up 40 percent and 20 percent of human-caused emissions, respectively. So the report also calls for reducing meat and dairy in diets, and cutting food waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KZn608"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Scientists created this seaweed to save the planet|100209" data-volume-uuid="6b92fbb78" data-volume-id="100209" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-936" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oarxr2"&gt;Slashing methane is also good for air quality, since it is one of the pollutants that contributes to smog. So cutting methane by 45 percent this decade wouldn’t just be good for the climate. It could also prevent 255,000 premature deaths and 775,000 asthma-related hospital visits each year, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eOTogt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most immediate benefits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98kURx"&gt;The United Nation’s new findings on methane follow a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report on carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, which called for a similar reduction in carbon dioxide this decade. While CO2 has gained the most notoriety as a greenhouse gas, methane is now in the spotlight. While CO2 can linger in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years, methane is much shorter-lived — it can&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dissipate within a decade. That ultimately means that, while eliminating carbon dioxide emissions is vital, taking on methane could lead to the most immediate benefits for people and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mv63s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLxM35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags have a hidden developer menu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12 and an AirTag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVPzQi3osLLB8rr10SVxtVnh3c0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246227/vpavic_4547_20210421_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p5mLXF"&gt;Apple’s new item-tracking AirTags have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt;, and they come with a surprise addition: a hidden menu in the Find My app that reveals some of the back-end data used by the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymdrEI"&gt;To uncover this menu, open up Apple’s Find My app, select one of your AirTags, then tap your name in the top left corner five times. And just like Dorothy clicking her heels together, you’ll be whisked away to a comforting world of, well, sliders and data. It’s not clear what all the information means, though some of the labels (like “device pitch”) are obvious enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzgAVG"&gt;The menu seems to be an accidental remnant of Apple’s development process, with the information presumably left over from an early beta version of the Find My app. Think of it like builders leaving architectural plans under the floorboards of a house they’re constructing. This is normal stuff, you just don’t usually see it (especially from Apple). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7Fb1OXOOrQ93BE4LM1fBa8o1Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495868/apple_airtags_developer_menu.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can access the menu by tapping in your name five times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IpZDmC"&gt;The menu itself was discovered by a self-described “frustrated” AirTags user on Reddit, who was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/n5vtle/frustration_lead_to_airtag_hidden_dev_mode"&gt;tapping around the app in annoyance&lt;/a&gt; when they uncovered the information. We were able to verify that the menu works with our own devices, as have plenty of people on Twitter, which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robertrosenfeld/status/1390178011920535553"&gt;where we first saw&lt;/a&gt; this accidental Easter egg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGbPWb"&gt;Over on Reddit, one user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/n5vtle/frustration_lead_to_airtag_hidden_dev_mode/gx3xqnd?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the bottom four sliders actually relate to the various colors your screen turns as you approach your AirTagged item. “A=% mixed with view; H=hue; S=saturation; V=value/brightness,” says Redditor pmarksen. “The top two sliders relate to camera blur, and brightness. Not sure what the middle ‘sum’ slider does yet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjS6hl"&gt;The “eco mode” label seems to refer to a battery-saving feature that deploys a smaller screen resolution (the Find My user interfaces includes an AR camera overlay that directs you to your item), while the “dots” options apparently refer to the number of dots that swarm on the screen as part of the animation that shows you approaching your target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVkxFq"&gt;If anyone else has any more hints, clues, or wild speculation about what else the screen shows, please feel free to drop by the comments below. We’ve pinged Apple to ask about this menu and expect to hear only embarrassed silence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will soon switch on two-factor authentication by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWm78hj2lPoo3qANGcE4I5RNOpE=/0x100:2100x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246166/twostep.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lhFBFo"&gt;Google is about to take a pretty significant step that will help keep user accounts more secure: it’s going to enroll people in two-factor authentication by default. Today the company &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it will soon start enrolling customers in two-factor authentication (or “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;two-step verification&lt;/a&gt;,” as Google calls it) if their accounts are “appropriately configured.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuNxkh"&gt;Once enabled, they’ll receive a prompt on their smartphone to verify that an attempted login with their Google account is legitimate. “Using their mobile device to sign in gives people a safer and more secure authentication experience than passwords alone,” said Google’s senior director of product management, Mark Risher. (On-phone alerts are more secure than SMS messages, which can be intercepted.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc0LzB"&gt;If standard two-factor authentication doesn’t cut it for you, you can always use a physical security key like those from YubiKey, or Google’s own Titan, as another way to safeguard your account. Back in 2019, Google also added the option for Android smartphones to serve as a security key, and this has since &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-smart-lock/id1152066360"&gt;been extended to iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc3Tad"&gt;This is all part of Google’s push for “a future where one day you won’t need a password at all,” and the news comes on World Password Day. Distressingly, even after countless enormous hacks and password dumps, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; 66 percent of Americans “still admit to using the same password across multiple sites, which makes all those accounts vulnerable if any one falls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BKcQC"&gt;Google advises customers to go through the company’s quick security checkup to ensure their settings and account protections are where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emGA8ro9D4lNLBPQkh0oh092_xQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66870539/acastro_200323_1777_gamingMouse_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever your budget or grip style is, we’ve found the best gaming mouse for you.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Multiple picks for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IQp8AK"&gt;Finding the right gaming mouse amid all the options available can be a struggle. There are a lot of factors to consider, like how it looks, how it feels in the hand, the button selection and arrangement, the quality of its sensor, and whether you want a mouse that’s wireless or wired. These details, minor as they seem, can have a major impact on your experience with the mouse you choose to buy. On the other hand, sometimes mice have features that get overblown and don’t actually work as well as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOD0oD"&gt;However your taste leans, you almost certainly want the best wireless gaming mouse that your budget allows for. We’re going to make this decision easy for you. The best gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most well-rounded choice if you want comfort, a long-lasting battery, and the best selection and arrangement of buttons. The model’s design accommodates multiple grip styles, and Logitech’s companion software is unobtrusive and a breeze to use. It also has rock-solid wireless connectivity so you don’t have to deal with a wire entangling your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbAxZF"&gt;If you don’t want a wireless mouse and are looking for the best wired gaming mouse, look no further than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;Razer DeathAdder V2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unbeatable in the ergonomics department, with a design that feels like a natural extension of your hand. And while this model has a fairly simple layout and button selection, it’s all just within reach and responsive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBKPjC"&gt;That’s not to say that several mice released more recently haven’t tested the throne, so to speak. Our latest update ropes in a few of the latest wireless and wired models from Logitech, Razer, SteelSeries, and other brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3lO4oA"&gt;The best wireless gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjQweePnmr6NqW900etrvOctA34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219644/akrales_190507_3407_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GenFNF"&gt;The Logitech G502 Lightspeed is a great gaming mouse for discerning gamers who don’t want to compromise, as well as people who have no idea what they should look for in a mouse. It’s comfortable, feature-packed, and even though it’s wireless, it’s a fast and accurate performer that doesn’t feel at a disadvantage against opponents using wired mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJdIHm"&gt;At $150 (though sometimes sold for around $100 these days), the best doesn’t come cheap. But if you’ve tossed around the idea of making an investment in a high-end wireless mouse, no other model that I tested for this buying guide justified its price so easily. The G502 Lightspeed has Logitech’s best features for its gaming and general-use mice rolled into one. The main buttons deliver a satisfying bounce response when you tap them, and unlike some other popular models, they click easily no matter how you grip your hand on the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIq7sZ"&gt;This mouse also features a quick-release button, a feature borrowed from other Logitech consumer-focused and gaming mice. By default, the scroll wheel staggers down a webpage with each step, which is how you expect a scroll wheel to work. Tapping the button releases the mechanism gripping the wheel, allowing it to freely sail to the bottom of a long page. It’s a small feature, but one that gives the mouse more versatility in certain situations, like being able to quickly scroll through your inventory when in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRLAe6Nq6SE9DoYoV5sxbZJTxrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219645/akrales_190507_3407_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Lightspeed may not have the most inviting design, but it’s incredibly comfortable to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q3DLU"&gt;Another nice feature is the inclusion of 16 grams of additional weights you can insert into the mouse to give it more resistance. A mouse’s weight comes down to personal preference, and that could vary from game to game. This mouse is among the few modern wireless devices to give you the flexibility to change up the weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2V6RE"&gt;The fact that the G502 Lightspeed is wireless makes it that much easier to bring along with you wherever you go. But if you just can’t swing the $150 price, I suggest that you check out the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;, which is the wired version of this mouse. It has almost every feature that you’ll find in the wireless model — except, you know, wireless capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBe8su"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SUnjee"&gt;Before moving on, it’s worth mentioning where Logitech’s lineup of wireless gaming mice fits in comparison. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight"&gt;G Pro X Superlight&lt;/a&gt; is a $150 option made for people who want a very lightweight mouse. It has the same Hero 25K sensor, so the tracking is just as good as the G502 Lightspeed, but it doesn’t have any extra features. In addition to being far lighter, it’s more plainly designed, with far fewer buttons. In fact, it’s pricier and has fewer buttons than the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726261308666686391" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;G Pro Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjhWDI"&gt;You’ll likely know if this is something you’d want more than our top pick, but since it’s more expensive than our top pick and less ergonomic, we still recommend the G502 Lightspeed for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1K4jR3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7xlEt"&gt;The runner-up: Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE ($90)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSLoek"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cheaper alternative to the best wireless gaming mouse &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34H4GpKR93Xz1ejL3_3XCarRxQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984098/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="elmLGV"&gt;Corsair’s Dark Core RGB Pro SE high-end wireless gaming mouse comes dangerously close to dethroning our top pick. It has a comfortable, ergonomic build with a high arch that makes it easy to relax with during long gameplay sessions or to power through work. Its design is less angular and sharp-looking than the G502 Lightspeed, so you might take to it more quickly based on looks alone. Though, when I’m not paying attention to how the two mice differ in appearance, they feel equally comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxusJS"&gt;It offers USB-C charging and supports Qi wireless charging if you have a wireless charger. This mouse can switch between 2.4GHz wireless mode via its included USB dongle (cleverly tucked under its removable, magnetic wing), or Bluetooth. Of course, you’ll get better results by using the dongle, but it’s great to have options. I found that the battery life, while decent, wasn’t quite as long-lasting as the G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOpEA3"&gt;Some smaller, but equally welcome, features here come in the form of that removable magnetic wing I just mentioned, which snaps onto its right side to let me comfortably rest my ring and pinky fingers on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYHfoi"&gt;The Dark Core held up nearly just as well in-game as Logitech’s mouse above, though the omission of two features made me miss using the G502 Lightspeed. It doesn’t have a dedicated sniper button, and there were a few instances where the model that I tested had a squeaky left mouse button. I don’t think it made a noise more than once every few hundred clicks, and it was tough to replicate it when I tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKufKm"&gt;Outside of the price differences, these two play a game of teeter-totter with features. Depending on who you ask, the Dark Core might have one or two up on the G502 Lightspeed. But Logitech’s mouse edges it out with better build quality, extra buttons (not to mention the excellent scroll wheel), and optional weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kf7Lfe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221795"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4N7EgV"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuU0vB9iDARo3BEjlybhYFTMpiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21996070/steelseriesaerox3hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SteelSeries&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bgfFJw"&gt;Other good wireless options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MfOTnc"&gt;The SteelSeries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21538891/steelseries-aerox-3-gaming-mouse-wireless-lightweight-honeycomb-water-resistant-usb-c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aerox 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; weighs significantly less than the top and runner-up picks at just 66 grams. That’s a big perk, as is its USB-C charging, which is still a rarity among other popular models from Razer and Logitech. It can operate on 2.4GHz wireless with its included USB-C dongle, or Bluetooth, and the Aerox 3 Wireless features an IP54 rating to protect it from some water and dust. It isn’t as ergonomic as the options above. While that might not be much of an issue for people who use it simply to game, it’s not particularly comfortable to use as an all-day device. Also, I noticed that it loses connection with my PC regularly, but rather than a connectivity issue, it seems like it falls asleep to preserve power if you don’t use it for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TR1BuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GoOPfo"&gt;Though, you don’t have to pay around $100 to get a solid wireless mouse that’s made for gaming. The $69.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403511/razer-orochi-v2-wireless-gaming-mouse-battery-life-custom-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Orochi V2&lt;/a&gt; improves on Razer’s previous battery-operated gaming mouse, the Basilisk X Hyperspeed, in some big ways. The marquee feature is its long-lasting battery life. Razer claims that a single AA battery can last for up to 950 hours in this mouse’s Bluetooth mode (or up to 425 hours by switching the bottom-mounted toggle over to the 2.4GHz Hyperspeed mode that offers lower latency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPLqgj"&gt;The Orochi V2 is an ambidextrous mouse, though it only features thumb buttons that cater to right-handed gamers. It has a similar arch in the palm section to the Basilisk X Hyperspeed that should cater to people who use a palm or fingertip grip in and out of gaming, though it’s more compact than most of Razer’s other gaming mice and might not fit larger hands well. Given the low price, you won’t find Razer’s best sensor inside, nor are there optical switches under the mouse buttons for the fastest performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2q8aDd"&gt;The best wired gaming mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2 ($70)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best wired gaming mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPODoDBPSU6YYV9veJq7J9hKMOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832658/deathadderv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAQPG"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 is proof that a wired mouse doesn’t need countless features to be worth the money. It just needs to be extremely good at the fundamentals, including being comfy enough to use for hours at a time with games that require quick reflexes, having a simple assortment of buttons that take little to no time to master, and, of course, great performance. If this matches what you want in a mouse, the $70 Razer DeathAdder V2 is the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oR5KE"&gt;Of all the wired gaming mice that I tested for this buying guide, no other mouse felt like a more natural extension of my hand. That’s crucial when you’re playing a game that requires precision, and it’s good to have when you just want to feel support while you’re using your computer in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HHFi1"&gt;The DeathAdder V2’s design provides a lot of palm support, whether my fingers are flat and relaxed over the mouse or arched when I need to use faster reflexes. I use my index finger to left click and middle finger to right click; unlike most mice, this design gives me enough space on its right side to keep my ring and pinky fingers from dangling off the side and dragging on the mouse pad. That’s something I didn’t know I wanted out of a mouse until I started using this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWZiOf"&gt;Those design features keep things comfortable, but I think the part of the mouse that sold me is where my thumb rests. Many mice etch out an area for your thumb to relax and laze around. That’s fine, but I find that it necessitates more arm movement when the action ramps up. I prefer this mouse’s solution: its ergonomic design keeps my thumb wrapped around its side, naturally resting upon the edges of the customizable macro buttons. It’s good to have multiple buttons within reach, and the thumb location makes it easy for me to push the mouse around using just my wrist. It’s comfortable and has the dual purpose of keeping me limber in case I need to make sudden movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDrU52"&gt;(Note: It’s worth mentioning before digging into specs that this mouse is rather large. If you want something a little smaller, but with the same design perks, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3K9K6P/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the $49.99 DeathAdder V2 Mini&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the same sensor as the larger model, topping out at 8,500 DPI versus 20,000, but the complimentary grip tape that’s included is a small consolation. Alternatively, if you like the larger size of the DeathAdder V2, but want a wireless version instead, you can get that in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FQMBKQG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DeathAdder V2 Pro, usually less than $100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zVjY6B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fjlknf"&gt;The runner-up: BenQ Zowie’s EC2 ($69)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BenQ Zowie EC2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hE1MusijcYopmb66zVUU8Kdn6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984101/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0012.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IyFgOW"&gt;BenQ Zowie’s EC2 may be an equally good, if not better, option for some people. This $69.99 mouse is my favorite of the company’s current catalog. It’s shaped similarly to the DeathAdder V2, in that it’s ergonomic and sloped to give your palm a comfortable surface to lay on while you game or browse. What’s more, there’s a generous amount of thumb space underneath the side buttons that I found to be spacious and equally accommodating to my grip style. All of Zowie’s mice are delightfully no-frills in terms of their design, but the EC2 is the most curvy mouse the company offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8OiDu4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221807"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oXpaI"&gt;The no-frills philosophy extends into the feature offering, but that’s not to say it’s lacking. I think the EC2 offers exactly what most gamers need, and perhaps of equal importance, nothing they don’t. This mouse features four buttons (two main, two side) and a DPI button that can be adjusted on the mouse’s bottom side. Even the more advanced settings, like adjusting lift-off distance or USB report rate, are done by holding down a unique sequence of buttons when you plug it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VyYR8X"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sBIvEu"&gt;Other good wired options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TeVjwP"&gt;If $150 for Logitech’s wireless G502 Lightspeed is too much for you to spend, you might want to consider this wired version, the G502 Hero. It has the same design as our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse — actually, it’s basically the same in almost every way, down to the kind of sensor it uses and its adjustable weights. That makes it almost as good, though some might take issue with its thick braided cable and the somewhat slippery plastic used on the scroll wheel that isn’t on the Lightspeed model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm9W6Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs4a0r"&gt;The Basilisk V2 is the wired mouse that I’d recommend to people who want the advantages of a modern Razer wired mouse, like the thin, braided SpeedFlex cable, fast performance, PTFE feet that let the mouse glide across your mouse pad, and, of course, LEDs. Despite having a design that might not fit well in everyone’s hands, it’s a smaller mouse that has more features than the DeathAdder V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I15iEA"&gt;For instance, the Basilisk V2 has a removable sniper button that’s easy to reach. Perhaps my favorite feature here is the scroll wheel that has an adjustable tension. It’s not quite as cool as the Logitech G502’s free-spinning wheel, but you’ll probably love it if you want a custom feel to your wheel. One of the best things about this mouse is that it has most of the same features found in the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20947669/razer-wireless-basilisk-gaming-pc-mouse-ultimate-x-hyperspeed-battery-life-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Basilisk Ultimate, Razer’s wireless version of this mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gmcFzc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
