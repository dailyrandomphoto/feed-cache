    <title>Razer says its new mechanical keyboards have ‘near-zero’ input latency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qh5js-SQjCc8OU_S7FH79y9xF9U=/0x0:3231x2154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866895/sc07sh01___Main_Key_Visual.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huntsman V2 includes a volume wheel and media keys.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="35qYtR"&gt;Razer has announced an update to its popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/28/17513342/razer-huntsman-elite-keyboard-ir-opto-mechanical-switches-chroma-led-lights"&gt;Huntsman lineup of mechanical keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that reduces input latency to “near-zero,” the company claims. That’s because the newly announced Huntsman V2 and Huntsman V2 Tenkeyless (which omits the numpad, volume wheel, and media controls for a more compact board) both have a polling rate of 8,000Hz, meaning they can theoretically detect key presses eight times faster than the original Huntsman keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azt3YF"&gt;Combined with the keyboards’ optical switches, which use an infrared beam of light to sense when they’ve been pressed rather than metal contact points, Razer reckons the two new Huntsman keyboards will feel more responsive for gaming, especially when combined with a high-refresh rate monitor. In contrast, standard mechanical switches can suffer from what’s known as a “debounce delay,” when the keyboard has to take a moment to work out if a key has actually been pressed or not. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMOGaUFN86RuflRbB2bhlO_Vn_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854691/sc07sh03_kv_v006.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tenkeyless model is more compact and features a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a8nNrf"&gt;Other improvements introduced with the V2 keyboards include new doubleshot PBT keycaps, which have a more durable design with legends that shouldn’t wear away over time. The doubleshot design also allows the keyboard’s programmable RGB backlighting to shine through the caps. There are seven preset lighting effects built into the keyboard, and you can customize them via Razer’s software and save them to the board’s firmware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YccwcO"&gt;Both keyboards are available with either Razer’s clicky or linear optical switches. The linear switches have also seen improvements since the keyboard’s first iteration, with the addition of a silicon sound dampener inside, and more lubricant to make them feel smoother to press. Razer also says it’s improved the acoustics of the keyboards, with the addition of a new layer of sound dampening foam, and there’s now a wrist rest included in the box with both keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHFwXY"&gt;The full-size Huntsman V2 features a volume wheel and media controls on its top right, but only the smaller tenkeyless model has a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P92tDg"&gt;The announcement of the new keyboards follows the launch of the first entry to the Huntsman V2 lineup earlier this year. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264192/razer-huntsman-v2-analog-keyboard-release-date-price-features"&gt;Huntsman V2 Analog&lt;/a&gt;, as its name suggests, is a keyboard with analog switches, allowing you to program two functions to a single key press or adjust exactly how much you need to push a key down for it to register a press (known as the “actuation point”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfouh7"&gt;Both of Razer’s new keyboards are going on sale today. The full-size Huntsman V2 will cost $189.99 with clicky switches and $199.99 with linear switches, while the more compact Tenkeyless model costs $149.99 with clicky or $159.99 with linear switches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gF1xCb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nh4Dcz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra Elite 3 review: nailing the essentials for $80</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;They’re consistent, they’re reliable, and they sound quite good for the price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RKkoGF"&gt;After establishing a strong reputation with great, dependable earbuds like the Elite 75t, Jabra is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"&gt;overhauling its whole lineup&lt;/a&gt; with three new models. At the high end are the $199 Elite 7 Pros and $179 Elite 7 Active earbuds, which will hit shelves in October. But for many, the most exciting part of Jabra’s latest trio will be the Elite 3 earbuds, which are the company’s first true wireless earbuds to launch at a price under $100. They only cost $79.99, putting them in competition with EarFun, Anker, JLab, and other companies that are known for quality buds on a budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjcMhN"&gt;Jabra doesn’t shoot for the Moon with the Elite 3s; they lack active noise cancellation and they sacrifice one feature that’s become a hallmark of Jabra earbuds: multipoint support. You can only pair these with one device at a time, whereas the company’s other products can connect to two audio sources simultaneously. It stings, but it’s also a predictable omission at this asking price. What you’re left with is a set of earbuds that outshine sound quality expectations, deliver lengthy battery life, and above all else, come through with consistent, reliable performance — which can’t always be said of other sub-$100 earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jsbIXU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10756229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VKd9bG"&gt;From a design standpoint, the Elite 3s have evolved beyond the utilitarian look of the 65t / 75t / 85t and show a little more style. Jabra describes it as “a sleek Danish design.” My review unit is the standard dark gray, but there are lilac purple and beige options if you want something brighter. Instead of the usual circular button on the exterior, these earbuds have more of a teardrop shape, and the mini stem with perforated mic holes from the company’s past buds is also gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40UGzV"&gt;But the Elite 3s feel very familiar once seated in your ears; thankfully, they use round ear tips instead of the oval-shaped tips that came with the 85t buds, which never fit as snugly as I would’ve liked. (Three sizes of silicone tips come in the box.) If you liked how the 75t buds fit, you’ll be right at home with these, and their lighter weight makes for even better comfort over longer periods. I never felt any soreness when wearing the Elite 3s. A good seal is crucial for the best passive noise isolation, and I was pleased with how these buds managed to subdue outside noise — even without ANC. They might lack multipoint, but on the plus side, you can use either earbud independently in mono mode. That hasn’t been the case for Jabra’s previous earbuds, so it’s a welcome improvement for the 2021 lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4qHSlvEv81OHeqFnfgzfzK0Q5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854830/DSCF5590_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These earbuds don’t protrude from the ear as far as Jabra’s others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gAnFzm"&gt;The charging case looks very similar to Jabra’s others and remains nicely compact. But the company definitely opted for a lighter, cheaper plastic this time; the lid has some creaking and a bit of flex, and the case itself picks up scuffs quite easily. Functionally, it does the job fine and holds the earbuds securely. And the battery status LED is sensibly positioned on the front, unlike older Jabra earbud cases where it was around back. There’s no wireless charging here — just USB-C for wired recharges. For battery life, Jabra says the Elite 3s can hit up to seven hours of continuous playing time, and my experience so far gives me little reason to doubt that estimate. The case holds enough juice for three recharges, so you get 28 hours of listening time in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Q0jm3hPx-XRfpIZpmLuIuLVwzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855009/DSCF5583_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case feels rather cheap and scuffs easily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hx7nHY"&gt;The Elite 3s don’t sound like $80 earbuds, and I mean that in the best possible way. Unlike the fatiguing, inarticulate sound signature that is all too common at this price, Jabra’s new budget buds have a nicely balanced EQ that lends the bass some added punch, but not to objectionable levels. The sound isn’t as full-bodied as with the Elite 75t or 85t buds, but it’s far from muddy. Listening to Kacey Musgraves’ new album &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, the Elite 3s did a great job with both elaborate, reverb-heavy tracks like “Cherry Blossom” and the vulnerable, acoustic “Hookup Scene.” Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” goes to show that the bass isn’t quite as thumping as on Jabra’s other earbuds, however. Supported Bluetooth codecs include standard AptX and SBC, but not Apple’s preferred AAC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQv8R5fwdzNT7_7wZvbXCynPD0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854839/DSCF5589_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elite 3s lack manual EQ controls, unlike Jabra’s other earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BHEAO8"&gt;The Jabra Sound Plus app, available on both Android and iOS, offers a few different EQ presets like bass and treble boost, though you lose the full slider controls that are reserved for the company’s pricier earbuds. That feels a little stingy to me, but I’ll take some EQ flexibility over none at all. You’re also stuck with the default controls, though there’s not much I’d want to change about them. The right earbud handles audio controls, while the left summons your preferred voice assistant. (Jabra supports Amazon Alexa in addition to Siri or Google Assistant.) I really like that the buttons now take up the full outer surface of the earbuds, making them effortless to find and press. And they’ve got a nice click. No one likes mushy buttons no matter the price. On Android, Jabra supports Fast Pair for quicker setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZ7EkqlsfRyZ3wNZas6R_l14yJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854832/DSCF5581_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jabra has redesigned its latest earbuds with a bit more style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPOmVz"&gt;The Elite 3s feature a HearThrough transparency mode to give you some awareness of your surroundings. But it’s muffled enough that I rarely bothered toggling it on. The situation where it’s most helpful is when you activate sidetone (which lets you better hear your own voice) on calls. Speaking of which, these earbuds perform decently but aren’t going to boggle the mind. I never got any complaints about mic quality on the phone or over Zoom, and everyone could clearly make out what I was saying, though they do have that talking-on-earbuds sound to them. For $80, that still checks off the “good enough” box for me. Jabra rates the durability of the Elite 3s as IP55, meaning they’re resistant to everyday dust and can handle sweat and splashes of water, but shouldn’t be submerged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="e5OFrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10756258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHo8WT"&gt;Despite their appealing cost and solid performance, I’ve still got some minor nitpicks: the Elite 3s use tones and beeps to indicate pairing status and other functions instead of the unmistakable voice feedback from Jabra’s prior earbuds. I really hope this doesn’t carry over to the more premium new models. There’s no auto-pause on the Elite 3s when you remove an earbud. And as we continue to see active noise cancellation trickle down into more affordable buds from companies like EarFun, Anker, and TCL, Jabra might have to get more ambitious next time around. Or at least improve the rinky-dink case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HS7AnS"&gt;But as the company’s first earbuds coming in under the $100 mark, the Jabra Elite 3s managed to impress me with their well-considered mix of sound quality, steadfast performance, easy controls, decent call quality, and lengthy battery life. There are other features you might &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; for one reason or another, but I can’t think of much else I’d really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wipeout gets ‘reimagined’ as a mobile game where you manage instead of drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wipeout Rush" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAYiRItfE5je3fDHFY-ogAwGD4w=/0x0:1942x1295/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866650/wipeoutrush.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="or3y46"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, the fast-paced, futuristic racing series that’s synonymous with PlayStation, is coming to iOS and Android mobile devices later in 2021. The new game is called &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, and unfortunately, it might not be what you’re after if you’ve adored previous entries in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI50dq"&gt;The game, developed by Rogue, is a card-based racing game that doesn’t actually put you in the driver's seat. Instead, you’ll be the team manager of racers who will get to do all of the fun driving while you’re dealing with cards. The game promises to dive into the lore of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m most looking forward to finding out why the player can’t drive. Did they lose their license?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pymiAg"&gt;Here’s a description of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rogueco.com/portfolio-item/wipeout-rush/"&gt;as noted on Rogue’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4Q0mTJ"&gt;For fans of the series, &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; is bringing loads of new lore through collectables and story. Players will be able to unlock collectable cards to learn more about the ships, teams, pilots, and tracks of the Wipeout world as they progress through an engaging single-player campaign told through exciting animated comics. &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; will include both Quick Race and Championship Cup game modes complete with 5 different tracks, 60 iconic Wipeout ships, a wide range of familiar weapons, 12 Championship Cups each with their own boss, and bundles of collectables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BX0rfV"&gt;For a second there, I imagined how great a &lt;em&gt;Wipeout &lt;/em&gt;game for phones could look and play, especially now that there are several phones with fast refresh rate displays (the iPhone 13 Pro is the most notable addition to that group recently), as well as solid mobile controllers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RonRWE"&gt;I’m willing to give this game a shot when it comes out, and it could be fun in its own way, but it’s been a while since I’ve so quickly gone from being excited about something to just being a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHi11c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXLIvJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is $800 off at Amazon today</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBksi0"&gt;Gaming laptops are by no means cheap, but today you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086M8PQYR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $800 on the Razer Blade 15 Advanced at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This laptop was built expressly for the purpose of delivering desktop gaming performance in a laptop form factor. Packing an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q graphics card and a 10875H Intel processor capable of topping out at 5.0GHz, the Razer Blade 15 does exactly that. The FHD display has a 300Hz refresh rate, better than you’d see on most desktop gaming monitors, allowing for sharp reaction times and virtually no lag, letting you get the drop on your enemy. A 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM round out the laptop’s specs, offering you plenty of onboard storage and speed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Razer Blade 15 Advanced review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="brF3EP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops you can buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="KJaYDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y47mjC"&gt;Ahead of the new 2021 base iPad releasing next Friday, September 24th, you can save $30 on a preorder through Walmart. Normally $329 for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;the 64GB Wi-Fi model that Apple just introduced&lt;/a&gt; at its “California Streaming” event, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1133983/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $299&lt;/a&gt;. So, get it for this price while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwoqO3"&gt;This model features a slate of improvements over the previous generation, including the bump up to 64GB of storage, the faster A13 Bionic processor, and True Tone screen tech that lets the screen match the color temperature in your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ObZyjs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbGCeh"&gt;If you’re a streamer in the market for a new microphone, look no further than the Razer Seiren Emote, now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XB39R7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This slick hyper-cardioid condenser microphone bears a striking resemblance to the other entries in the Seiren family, until it connects with Razer’s streamer companion app. The front of the mic contains an 8-bit LED display, capable of showing hundreds of customizable emotes that react to your chat. While this mic certainly isn’t for everyone, you’ll have a hard time finding a microphone more unique or better suited to connecting with your audience during a stream. Amazon notes that only a few units are left in stock, so hopefully it replenishes throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w0ml3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gj9UpW"&gt;Anyone looking for a midsize 4K TV should definitely check out this deal at Best Buy. This 50-inch model from Sony is still &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAEDde5Aev#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy for $700&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. In addition to offering crisp 4K resolution, the X80J touts several features that elevate the viewing experience. HDR10 and Dolby Vision certification provide deeper blacks and more vivid colors, while built-in voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant allow you to easily search and swap channels. The TV includes built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, too, which help cut down on cord clutter, and the X80J can be wall-mounted with any 200 x 200 VESA mount. The TV can also handle up to four HDMI devices and offers an audio return channel in case you want to route your devices through a soundbar or receiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nHPwZ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gReWX9"&gt;One of the lightest wireless mice in Razer’s arsenal is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Hyperspeed-Lightest-Wireless/dp/B07YPC3BQC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for just $120 today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its normal retail price of $150. The Viper has been a mainstay of the Razer armory for some time, but this wireless version brings some solid improvements to the tested design. The Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed weighs a paltry 74 grams and packs a powerful 20K DPI optical sensor. The ambidextrous design also sports six remappable buttons, making it one of the best mice available for southpaw shooters. The most noticeable improvement, however, is the inclusion of wireless connectivity. It can be paired either via Bluetooth or to the included 2.4GHz dongle, and the Viper Ultimate is said to last up to 70 hours on a single charge and can be recharged either via Micro USB or with the included recharging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udUahX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V7YzIa"&gt;A pair of earbuds that no Apple aficionado should be without, the Beats Powerbeats Pro, are &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1151608/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpowerbeats-pro-wireless-earphones%2F-%2FA-78362035" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Target for $175 in red&lt;/a&gt;. These water-resistant earbuds can handle even the sweatiest workouts, and the adjustable ear hooks ensure they won’t jostle loose during a run. The earbuds can last for up to nine hours on a single charge but can stretch to 24 hours if the case is topped off. While the earbuds definitely work best with Apple devices thanks to their built-in H1 chip — a piece of hardware allows for always-on Siri detection and better call quality in windy environments, among other improvements — they can be used with a wide variety of Bluetooth-enabled devices. Just note that the charging case can only connect using an Apple lightning cable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WGWd5F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EzqOl"&gt;A solid addition to any Xbox or PC gaming setup, the HyperX CloudX Flight Wireless is currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAVP3dG6gn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fkingston-hyperx-cloudx-flight-wireless-gaming-headset%2F93G680VL1NKH%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; for $120, its second-best price to date. HyperX is known for its comfortable and functional gaming headsets. It may lack some of the outward flair of its competitors, but the CloudX can still trade blows with competing headsets that are nearly double the price. The CloudX Flight comes with a detachable boom mic, leatherette ear cups, and boasts a battery life of up to 30 hours. While the CloudX has been designed for the Xbox family of consoles, it can still connect to PCs thanks to its 2.4GHz wireless dongle. It even comes with a built-in chat mixer, so you can adjust your audio levels without combing through in-game menus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the YouTubers determined to find lost media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sCwC-RHX-F1GCne1KUh-_Mv9zQ=/119x0:1382x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866569/a2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bobdunga&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AM5RO"&gt;When I was 11, I remember seeing a weird commercial on television. During the commercial break of a Slamball rerun (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ib-AJA7v9Kk"&gt;remember Slamball?&lt;/a&gt;) on Cartoon Network, I saw an AIDS awareness ad. It was made specifically for kids, and it was accompanied by an annoying rap. I distinctly remember the chorus: “What do you know about AIDS?!” It’s been stuck in my head for years. I guess you’re expecting me to link the commercial I’m describing, right? Well, I can’t, because I’ve never found it. I’ve never even seen it mentioned online. This commercial is what’s known as “lost media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nM1W5Y"&gt;Online, there’s a lost media community dedicated to preserving everything from unaired television pilots to unreleased video game prototypes. Currently, the lost media community exists on both YouTube and &lt;a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Home"&gt;the Lost Media wiki&lt;/a&gt;, an archive of thousands of lost media topics. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LSuperSonicQ"&gt;LSuperSonicQ&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known member of the lost media community and has many videos covering lost media topics such as the &lt;em&gt;Johnny Bravo&lt;/em&gt; pilot and unreleased My Chemical Romance songs. His fascination with lost media started on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs6Hiq"&gt;“I knew nothing about lost media at all until I watched a video from this other kind of lost media YouTuber,” said LSuperSonicQ. “His name is blameitonjorge. And this is like, back in 2015… It was like, top 40 lost or banned episodes of kids TV shows.” LSuperSonicQ watched the video, and from that point on, he said, he was “hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ij0fR"&gt;Lost media searches can take a long time, depending on what is being sought after and whether there are any complications, such as nondisclosure agreements, people leaving jobs, or creators just not remembering past projects. LSuperSonicQ took months to find the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2s0nFAw8GeU"&gt;lost pilot for the TV show &lt;em&gt;Kappa Mikey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which aired on Nicktoons Network in the mid-2000s. This lost pilot was made in order to pitch the show to MTV. LSuperSonicQ was able to contact the creator of the show and convince him to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8KoVLI3XuGM"&gt;upload that original pilot to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He now considers this his favorite piece of lost media. Plus, the search was a good learning experience for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNSk3y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KoVLI3XuGM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDuUMd"&gt;“That was a really, really big deal, when that happened,” said LSuperSonicQ. “It was my longest-lasting media search at the time, and I learned a lot of techniques in that search that I have applied to future searches and how I go about contacting people and trying to find stuff. So it was a really, really big turning point in my own personal lost media journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3hu7xP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NIqqmw"&gt;Not all searches end in success, but they can still be entertaining, since lost media is all about the search and why the media became lost in the first place. YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GWq_TBvJKWLFIb2eLp-bw"&gt;Bobdunga&lt;/a&gt; recently dove into the world of lost media in her hunt for the &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;video game, chronicling her search in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D8ZUR2De15s"&gt;two-part Youtube documentary&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;game was always seen as a mystery by the lost media community, but most didn’t seem too interested in solving it. “I feel that a lot of that had to do with the fact that the game was inherently deemed as shovelware right off the bat,” said Bobdunga. The 2000s featured many licensed games that were created just to cash in on the popularity of an upcoming film release. “This was especially common for ‘girl games,’” said Bobdunga. “I think a lot of people behind the scenes didn’t have that good of a grasp at what girls liked in gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRERfr"&gt;For her, &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;was more than just another “girl game.” “What really drew me to wanting to dive into &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; was mainly because it was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation,” she said. “I think it was my want to dissect all of it, even if I didn’t come out finding the actual game, that really drew me into the project.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT0ECm"&gt;She told me this was her first time creating YouTube content about lost media, but not her first experience with it. “I’ve always been very partial to both true crime and lost media videos,” she said. “They seem to fit together really well, because they both share an ominous, almost storytelling-like atmosphere. And a lot of the time, the narrator will have a really calm or even creepy voice to further immerse the viewer. There’s something inherently spooky about lost media, especially in a digital age where we feel we can find everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFC0Qy"&gt;After months of searching, she eventually found it. An anonymous source sent her the game’s ROM file after viewing the first part of her documentary. Since then, she has recently &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3AQh9Nx6_Gw"&gt;uploaded footage of the game&lt;/a&gt; to her YouTube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywokja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8ZUR2De15s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3SLvt0"&gt;Enthusiasts see lost media as a way to preserve history, even if it’s something as obscure as a canceled video game or lost TV pilot. “Not everything has such a strong digital footprint, and it’s important to preserve all types of media, whether it be physical or digital,” said Bobdunga. “It isn’t only a nostalgic memory for some but the media in question could also act as a small glimpse into what the world was like when it was produced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuy427"&gt;LSuperSonicQ took a similar stance. “It has to do with pop culture. It has to do with, you know, what people were interested in at the time it was made. And there’s lost media that goes all the way back to the 1920s. They’re silent films that are lost for people to look for. And it goes all the way up to the 2010s and 2020s. By being able to preserve and archive and document that kind of thing, I really think, in a way, it really helps the historical aspect of our culture and where we came from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CyiBe"&gt;Without the work of the lost media community, these parts of our culture and history would be lost to time. In the digital age, it has become harder for media to get lost, since almost everything is online, but it is still a possibility. If companies don’t do their part by making their older media easily available, then it’s up to the fans to do their part and preserve history.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new ninth-gen iPad is $30 off before it’s even out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UmwDCYocH1nUKb0fnM_2ejgvhzo=/170x0:2006x1224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866492/apple_event_2021_427.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XM74UA"&gt;Apple just announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at the iPhone 13 event and began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;taking orders&lt;/a&gt;, with availability opening up on September 24th. But now, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a nice discount on preorders of its own&lt;/a&gt;. You can preorder the new base model 2021 iPad with a $30 discount, bringing the price down to just $299 for the 64GB Wi-Fi configuration. It will ship a little bit later than if purchased through Apple, around September 29th, but it’s rare get a 10 percent discount on a brand-new product if you’re willing to wait just a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J4xFRv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I4Nhvs"&gt;The new iPad is the latest version of Apple’s most popular model of tablet. It features a 10.2-inch non-laminated Retina display, Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the physical home button, first-generation Apple Pencil compatibility, and a smart connector for a keyboard attachment. If that all sounds familiar, it should, because those are holdovers from last year’s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92b3sY"&gt;This new model also has a claimed 20 percent performance bump thanks to its A13 Bionic processor, double the base storage at 64GB, a 20W USB-C charger with USB-C to Lightning cable included, True Tone display, and the new Center Stage feature for keeping you framed up during video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq1RDA"&gt;The entry-level iPads have long been the default tablet for many, and it’s nice to see some quality of life improvements when many folks out there might find a device like this essential for child use or content-consumption — even nicer when you can be an early adopter and still save some coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gxuQkE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ShlYno"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro announces Hero 10 Black with 5.3K60 and smartphone-like features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxGdhOQ9nQCHMwhdxfcLqZS1YEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866244/bfarsace_210909_4746_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HtLuLw"&gt;GoPro has announced the next version of its action camera, which has a new processor that lets the camera shoot in higher frame rates (for that cool slow-motion footage), have better stabilization, and automatically upload videos to the cloud while charging. The new processor also works to make using the GoPro Hero 10 Black a faster, more responsive experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXH0lD"&gt;In a lot of cases, the Hero 10 can shoot at double the frame rate of the Hero 9: it can now shoot at 5.3K at 60 frames per second (offering both the frame rate improvement as well as a small resolution bump) and can shoot at 4K120, and 2.7K240. While 240fps is still as slow (er, fast?) as the camera will get, it’s now able to shoot that frame rate at 2.7K, versus the 1080 resolution limit of the GoPro Hero 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3PvkVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of GoPro’s biggest competition is phone cameras, and it’s more like a phone than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qI2gAq"&gt;GoPro says this increase in performance is due to the camera’s new GP2 processor, which is a successor to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fwhat-is-the-gp1-chip-in-hero6-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the GP1 chip it’s used in cameras ever since the Hero 6 Black&lt;/a&gt;. The company continuing to have custom chips for its cameras is a tactic that makes sense, as some of GoPro’s toughest competition comes from the smartphone market, where companies like Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;and Google&lt;/a&gt; are taking the same approach. The GP2 also allows the Hero 10 to be phone-like in a few ways, from its very responsive touchscreen to the heavy video processing that it's doing with things like local tone mapping and improved noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u74tCr"&gt;Arguably, though, one of the most smartphone-esque features is the camera's ability to upload videos to the cloud while it’s charging. However, doing so will require &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fsubscribe-to-gopro-subscription%2FGoProPlusYearly.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a GoPro subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 a month or $50 a year. The subscription also gets you $100 off the camera, bringing its price of $499 down to $399, and it also includes access to GoPro’s &lt;a href="https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/GoPro-Subscription-Camera-Replacement-FAQ/ta-p/394296"&gt;damaged camera replacement program&lt;/a&gt;. The launch price, though, represents the slow creep up of the cost of GoPro’s cameras — without a subscription, the Hero 9 cost $450 at launch, which was itself up from $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892060/gopro-hero-8-black-mounitng-system-software-specs-price-ship"&gt;with the Hero 8&lt;/a&gt;. This year, of course, there’s also the possible factor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the ever-present chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ihdly_jTD5S3x-1x5hazefgXzEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853035/UuWJ4Owe.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GoPro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro continues to push its subscription by offering discounts and adding new features that rely on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="buOYUB"&gt;For those who don’t want a subscription, it’s also easier to get footage off the camera with your smartphone. GoPro says the new chip makes wireless transfers to its app 30 percent faster, and there’s also a new option to transfer your footage with an honest-to-goodness cable for those really looking for reliable, fast offloading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikY9y85R8pkH_IzQX2fuEkas-HQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853257/GPOP.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro’s maximum horizon leveling mixed with HyperSmooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOYQaD"&gt;The new camera also comes with a few smaller improvements that make it more appealing. The camera’s “horizon leveling” feature, where it tries to keep the horizon as a straight line, lets the camera tilt up to 45 degrees before the sky starts moving, compared to the 27 degrees from the Hero 9. Unfortunately, the improved horizon leveling isn’t available on the camera’s highest resolutions and frame rates, as it’s limited to 4K at 60 frames per second and 2.7K or 1080 at 120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiem0Y"&gt;The still photos the camera takes are also getting a resolution bump, from 20MP to 23MP, with still frames pulled from video reaching 19.6MP when shooting in the camera’s 5K 4:3 mode and 15.8MP when shooting in the 5.3K60 mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mooYPB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hero 10 has some quality-of-life improvements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yo91xI"&gt;GoPro also says that a new generation of its HyperSmooth stabilization feature can be used while you’re streaming live — though getting the highest video quality from your streams will also require a GoPro subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWNh8U"&gt;If you had a Hero 9 and bought some of GoPro’s Mod add-ons, the company says most of them should be compatible — including the Max Lens Mod, though support for it will be coming in a future software update. Even the stock lens gets a bit of improvement, though, with GoPro saying that it should repeal water easier and be harder to scratch. (And, of course, it’s still removable.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The GoPro Hero10: small step for the Hero10, big leap for GoPro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A familiar body, but with all-new brains&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ObBlrn"&gt;Last year GoPro did a complete overhaul of its Hero action camera lineup with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;GoPro Hero9&lt;/a&gt;. It added a front-facing screen, 5K filming, and more battery life. This year’s GoPro Hero10 is an iterative update that builds on the foundation laid by the 9. But while the $500 Hero10 looks almost identical to the Hero9, there is one big change that sets the stage for much bigger things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="msg5t9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10755081"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UlNfDg"&gt;Although GoPro claims the Hero10 is 3 percent lighter than the Hero9 (153g vs. 158g), it feels identical in my hands. The one distinguishing feature between the two models is the blue labeling on the Hero10, versus the silver decals on the Hero9. There is a grippy, rubber finish; stowable mounting prongs; two physical rubber buttons for power, mode switching, and recording; two screens; and a latching battery, USB-C port, and microSD card slot compartment. GoPro claims the removable lens covers are more scratch resistant and water-repelling, while at the same time producing less ghosting. I didn’t have any trouble with my Hero9’s lens cover, but more protection is always welcomed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_JiZxMHZkOOxjfIA4ZowFUXddc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851873/bfarsace_210909_4746_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hero 10 has the same hardware as the Hero 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6D4cmdRZzXPAqPO9hALVAvQRIUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851869/bfarsace_210909_4746_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a rubber record button on the top of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETShAt2tvAjhrC-Ao5HWjfWOGiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851867/bfarsace_210909_4746_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rubber button on the side of the camera is for power and mode switching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmlCGp"&gt;Internally the GoPro Hero10 is getting a big upgrade with the new GP2 processor. This is the first processor change to the Hero lineup since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/6/16388394/hero-6-black-hands-on-sample-video-photos"&gt;Hero6&lt;/a&gt; that came out in 2017, and it provides a much needed speed update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UK4Fga"&gt;First, GoPro claims the Hero10 can upload footage to your phone or the cloud 30 percent faster because of the GP2 processor. And for the first time in the Hero lineup, you can plug your GoPro directly into your phone for 50 percent faster uploads to your device via GoPro’s Quik app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zjHug"&gt;Second, the front screen now has a higher frame rate, even though it is exactly the same hardware as the Hero9. In most modes you will now see a 30fps image on that front screen. I also noticed there is a lot less lag on the front screen when actively recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3kGDI"&gt;But more importantly, the third speed boost, and the most notable one, is that the Hero10 can capture content quicker. In photo mode, the Hero10 both takes and saves a photo much faster than the Hero9. I was able to take three HDR photos on the Hero10 before a single photo was done processing on the Hero9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XlsuM"&gt;That speed is also noticeable when stopping a video recording, where the Hero10 is able to save the recorded video faster so you can get back to the live view and menus. All of that being said, there is still a lag that I find especially annoying when attempting to snap photos. The system is still far from perfect for a quick photo capture. But with higher resolution screen grabs from the video you don’t have to worry about snapping stills at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9Uteno0sjpm9y_9oh2vnA5ma4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851866/bfarsace_210909_4746_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New this year is 5.3K filming at 60fps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kgHlVt"&gt;The Hero10 can grab 19.6-megapixel photos from 5.3K 4:3 video. That’s up from 12-megapixel frame grabs in 4K 4:3 video on the Hero9. In a 16:9 frame, the Hero10 can provide up to 15.8-megapixel photos from 5.3K video, where the Hero9 maxed out at 14.7-megapixel photos from 5K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSN3IX"&gt;Although this is the same 23.6-megapixel sensor that was used in the Hero9, GoPro claims the GP2 processor can get more out of it. The Hero10 takes photos in four modes: live burst, which continuously captures images as you hold down the shutter; burst, for a set amount of photos taken in one burst; night; and standard photo. There are also four color processing options that range from SuperPhoto for the most in-camera color and contrast processing, to RAW that provides the flattest image for post color work. Across the board, the photos are punchy in perfect lighting but take on a lot of grain in lower light, even in night mode. I’ve never viewed a GoPro camera as a photo-first tool, and even with the higher megapixel photos, this camera is best in video mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oLoJEg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10755129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="nDYPfc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the GoPro Hero10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="AbtIyP"&gt;The Hero10 can shoot 5.3K video at 60fps, 4K at 120fps, and 2.7K at 240fps. That is a frame rate boost at every resolution compared to the Hero9, and that 5.3K60 setting is really great for dreamy shots of water or snow flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtLK4t"&gt;GoPro is also releasing HyperSmooth 4.0, GoPro’s in-body stabilization software, with the Hero10. Long gone are the days of needing a gimbal for a GoPro. There are three stabilization levels: boost, standard, or off. Boost crops your image the most but provides the best stabilization. With HyperSmooth 4.0 also comes an extended tilt limit of its horizon leveling feature, letting you get more sideways while still maintaining a level shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiTKta"&gt;If GoPro continues to improve this feature, I could see there being a day where needing to mount your GoPro level to the horizon is no more, much like Insta360’s micro action camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319707/insta360-go-2-action-camera-test-price-specs-features"&gt;the Go 2&lt;/a&gt;, that supports 360-degree horizontal leveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyvihk"&gt;The Hero10 also uses the same batteries as the Hero9, although at the highest capture resolutions, like the new 5.3K 60fps, you will see greater battery drain. I was needing two batteries to get through a full day of casual filming in these high resolutions as opposed to one battery for a day of casual filming with the Hero9.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Qwwu54J95fUzcJwg0VOAyZrhVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851872/bfarsace_210909_4746_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hero 10 is still waterproof up to 33 feet without external housing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNJCBl"&gt;The Hero9 and Hero10 footage is almost indistinguishable once exported. With the Hero10’s 5.3K footage there is a teeny-tiny bit more room to punch in, but unless you are a 60fps super fan, I think most Hero9 users won’t need to upgrade this year. GoPro claims the GP2 processor also allows for local tone mapping and 3D noise reduction in it’s video algorithms, not just in photos, which should provide for better low-light performance and better detail in small, typically tough to film places such as blades of grass. But while I found the Hero10 to have slightly better low-light performance, there is still a lot of smoothing and noise happening to the image, and there is still a graininess to the image when lighting conditions are not perfect. Check out our video above for loads of samples where you can see that this camera still performs best on sunny, blue sky days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A8SbS"&gt;The last change in image is in the color differences between the two cameras. This year GoPro is natively setting the Hero10’s color preset to natural as opposed to vivid, or “GoPro Color” on the Hero9. Although, again, you really have to pixel peep to see a difference between the two settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCjsVF"&gt;There are a few features I didn’t get to test in my time with the Hero10 that will be rolling out in a large software update coming on November 16th. The Hero10 will be getting Max lens mod support, a few additional resolutions including 24fps at all resolutions, and the SuperView lens at 5.3K 30, 25, and 24fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOGob5LpGiSXwmrY9FXGHJc0RUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22851868/bfarsace_210909_4746_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At $500, the Hero 10 is the most expensive Hero camera since the Hero6 launched in 2017.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HpL6yk"&gt;The Hero10 remains a great action camera because of its size, durability, and 5.3K 60fps abilities. There is simply no other camera this size that is this powerful, and if you currently own a Hero8 or older, the Hero10 will feel like a huge upgrade. But I don’t think it’s a big enough leap forward for Hero9 users unless you need that buttery 5.3K 60fps or have to have the latest and greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY1hBA"&gt;The Hero10 is also very expensive. It retails for $500 without a GoPro subscription, $400 for existing GoPro subscribers, or $400 for new subscribers with an included year of GoPro subscription. This is the most expensive Hero camera GoPro has put out since it last updated the processor in the Hero6. For a hundred dollars less, the Hero9 is still plenty capable and still available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe5uCu"&gt;But, with all of that being said, the GP2 processor sends a very clear sign that GoPro isn’t done pushing the limits of this small, action camera. When GoPro released the GP1 processor in the Hero6, GoPro was facing an incredibly rocky future after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/15/14922328/gopro-karma-drone-review"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; at making a drone and a gimbal. GoPro decided with the GP1, its first custom-made processor, to slim down the company and focus solely on Hero Blacks, 360 cameras such as the Fusion then the Max, and its subscription service. Instead of going big in many directions, it set out to make a select few really great products that had enough features for the pros but were easy enough for a hobbyist to pick up, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPMN4W"&gt;The result is a balanced camera that provides plenty of resolutions for any task, an easy-to-use UI, and a subscription service worth its price. If GP1 is any indicator of how far GoPro can push its systems, the next few years looks very promising for the Hero lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="LNtu5R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10755247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Lucid Air is the first electric car with a 520-mile EPA-rated range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AUTOMOBILE-WIRELESS-TRANSPORT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v6CW4wLy31jsaEX7ikZLBpL6IWA=/0x0:5449x3633/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866111/1231386762.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="flyhpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Motors’ Air Dream Edition&lt;/a&gt; has received an Environmental Protection Agency-rated range of 520 miles, making it the longest-range EV ever rated by the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNnVJP"&gt;The EPA rating certifies Lucid’s claim from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21358613/lucid-motor-air-electric-vehicle-ev-range-517-miles"&gt;over a year ago&lt;/a&gt; that its forthcoming electric sedan would be the longest range production EV on the market. It also represents a victory for Lucid Motors CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;who led development of the Model S when he worked at Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and has said that the Air will outmatch Elon Musk’s company in terms of range, luxury, acceleration, and price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7a2gA"&gt;The Air Dream Edition bests the longest-range Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292629/tesla-model-3-long-range-plus-epa-rating-aerodynamic-wheels-mass-reduction-efficiency"&gt;the Model S Long Range Plus&lt;/a&gt;, by over 100 miles. But that added range will come at a cost, with the Dream Edition with 19-inch wheels starting at $169,000. If that sticker price is too spicy for you, it may be best to wait until 2022, when Lucid plans to release a base model that starts at $77,400 (or $69,900 with the federal EV tax credit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdRQwm"&gt;The EPA also rated the various trim levels, such as the Dream Edition with 21-inch wheels (481 miles), Dream Edition Performance (471 miles with 19-inch wheels and 451 miles with 21-inch wheels), and the Grand Touring (516 miles with 19-inch wheels and 469 miles with 21-inch wheels). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zu2GuN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Air’s 113kWh battery pack, as well as its aerodynamic design, help contribute to the vehicle’s impressive range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OFHr41"&gt;The Air’s 113kWh battery pack, as well as its aerodynamic design, help contribute to the vehicle’s impressive range. Of course, range is highly subjective and the EPA rating is meant to present a snapshot of the Air’s performance under the specific conditions of the agency’s testing process. It typically excludes factors such as steep hill climbing and the effects of cold weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYjbbV"&gt;“The EPA estimates, including EV range, are meant to be a general guideline for consumers when comparing vehicles,” the agency says &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/explaining-electric-plug-hybrid-electric-vehicles"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. “Just like ‘your mileage may vary’ for gasoline vehicles, your range will vary for EVs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e7l0f"&gt;EV range is determined independently by the EPA, as well as Europe’s Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which are typically more optimistic than the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYXtUg"&gt;The Newark, California-based company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;which recently went public&lt;/a&gt;, is gearing up to start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547202/lucid-motors-air-electric-vehicle-hands-on-test-drive"&gt;delivering its first vehicles to customers later this year&lt;/a&gt;, and it has already built more than 100 near-final quality versions at its new factory in Arizona. Lucid is hosting a production preview at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21739985/lucid-motors-ev-factory-construction-arizona"&gt;Advanced Manufacturing Plant factory&lt;/a&gt; (known as AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make iPhone 13 preorders a one-step process on Friday by following these steps  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_vNfkWDiabkczCTpDc4TicD6fM=/277x0:1456x786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866078/image__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process lets you make your selection ahead of preorders opening.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bQuvga"&gt;If you’re planning on preordering one of Apple’s new iPhone 13 models at 8AM ET on Friday, September 17th, you might be interested to know that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; customers can pre-register their details to make the checkout process a little easier. Now, before you say anything, I completely agree that the idea of &lt;em&gt;pre-registering &lt;/em&gt;for a &lt;em&gt;preorder&lt;/em&gt; sounds ridiculous. But if you’re someone who wants to complete the preorder as quickly as possible to guarantee an early ship date during a time of global component shortages, it’s a useful trick to know. Just be aware that this process is only available until midnight on Thursday, Eastern Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuY6R"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-upgrade-program-iphone-12/?Bibblio_source=true"&gt;isn’t the first time Apple has offered pre-registration&lt;/a&gt;. But previously this route appears to have been reserved for customers on the iPhone Upgrade Program, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/iphone-13-pre-orders-get-ready/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-month payment plan that includes AppleCare Plus and offers a phone upgrade each year. But now anyone can enter their details early to buy a phone with far less hassle on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU0o9c"&gt;To pre-register, head over to the Apple Store app or &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone"&gt;Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt; to get started. Anyone on the upgrade plan will have their upgrade eligibility checked and credit lines approved. Other customers can pick out their preferred iPhone model, register their carrier status, enter payment details, and pick out accessories and / or an AppleCare Plus plan. Just be aware that some users are reporting seeing a “Your iPhone pre-order has expired” error message, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/16/expired-phone-13-pre-order-message-glitch/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Xkgk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 16th, 9:35AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added link to Apple’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-offers-more-ways-to-shop-for-the-iphone-13-lineup-ipad-and-ipad-mini/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;press release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
