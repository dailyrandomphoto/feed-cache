    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfygW5"&gt;Wireless earbud reviews don’t just happen. Three weeks ago, I got my hands on seven pairs of wireless earbuds to see which is the best option under $100. This might sound like Christmas Day for many, but the sight of such a pile on my desk for me spells ear pain and the inevitable feeling of needing to find new music to love or podcasts to be fascinated by. Don’t get me wrong, I love my job but what no one told me about reviewing tech is it takes time and dedication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QarqVo"&gt;When researching what earbuds I wanted to test, I started with reputable companies with established customer service operations. I also sent many Slack messages to my co-worker Chris Welch who also reviews wireless headphones for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Then, the earbuds started flowing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnVlmP"&gt;I always start my earbud testing the same: wear each model for at least one battery cycle to get a sense of pairing, controls, battery life, and comfort. A good wireless earbud has to check four boxes for me: good sound quality, solid Bluetooth connection, comfortable fit without being too large, and enough battery life for at least four hours of continuous listening. Oh! And a good mic is a big plus, but I also realize that not everyone talks on the phone as much as I do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skullcandy Indy Evos have a really snug fit that will feel secure for first-time wireless earbud users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq7sAM"&gt;For this video I tested Skullcandy’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Sesh-True-Wireless-Earbud/dp/B0857JLRFJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$59.99 Sesh Evo&lt;/a&gt;, Skullcandy’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Indy-True-Wireless-Earbud/dp/B084SC59D7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99 Indy Evo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-buds-z#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$49.99 OnePlus Buds Z&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.1more.com%2Fproducts%2Fpistonbuds-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$49.99 1More PistonBuds&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-215TWS-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08L9QWQ1Z/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=JBL+Tune+215TWS&amp;amp;qid=1607006280&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$69.99 JBL Tune 215TWS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Charging-Resistance-Connection/dp/B086PB4J44?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$30 JLab Go Air&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725525814770003251" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99 JLab Epic Air ANC&lt;/a&gt; earbuds. Those are the regular retail prices for each model, but these frequently go on sale and it’s not hard to find any one of them for even less than their sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38usrG"&gt;In the first round of testing, I made three eliminations. First, Skullcandy’s Sesh Evos for their very large-sized buds that never stayed in my ears and their very plastic, cheap-feeling case. Next, the 1More PistonBuds were eliminated for needing to pull the right bud out of the case first so that it would connect to the left bud, which would then connect to my phone — a tediously clumsy process. If I didn’t pull the PistonBuds out in that order, the left bud would connect to my phone before connecting to the right bud and then only play media out of the left bud. And lastly, the JLab Go Airs were cut because of their open case design which, although it has magnets to keep the earbuds seated, resulted in them coming out of their case in my backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesxxm"&gt;With four pairs left, it was time for round two: natural selection. At this price point, the difference in each model is fit, build quality, and connection. I keep all of the headphones that are still in play in a pile on my desk and every morning I see what I naturally gravitate toward the most and when. Very quickly, I was able to determine my favorite pair. Although they lack a lot of the touch controls I like on other models, I kept going back to the $49.99 OnePlus Buds Z.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The OnePlus Buds Z deliver a full sound in a small, affordable package." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rPhEbpBGp3SbOTFb5E-5_HHjuaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22053533/oneplus.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Buds Z, pictured on a shelf, are great budget wireless earbuds that cost only $50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vklG88"&gt;The OnePlus Buds Z’s 10mm drivers deliver a full sound with decent separation of highs and lows, but above all else, they have a kicking bass. There is IP55 water resistance and the silicone ear tips block out enough loud noise to be able to hear music clearly, even on the subway. I take each of my top picks on a few subway rides to test how much sound is being blocked and how strong of a Bluetooth connection they have. On my nightly walk around Brooklyn it never felt like a hassle to bring the Bud Z’s small, light case and I found I could comfortably wear the buds for long listening sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu3Y7C"&gt;Typically, at the point in my testing where I have chosen a winner, I would have my friends over for a cookout and spring earbud testing upon them. Right after dinner, I would grab my top picks and a bottle of rubbing alcohol and we would go around testing each pair. This time, I had to rely on more Slacks to Chris Welch and just one trusty friend. But even with a smaller pool, the choice was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8PKf4"&gt;From the balanced sound quality with decent bass, a mic I could use on Zoom calls, and a comfortable fit, the Buds Z feel more premium than the other earbuds in this price range. They also have a case that doesn’t feel plasticky, although it lacks wireless charging, one of my favorite features. At this price, though, there’s really little to complain about. Check out the video for more information on the OnePlus Buds Z and to see what I choose as my second and third choices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the lieutenant governor pushing Democrats to get serious about weed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman thinks legalization is the biggest popular issue no one wants to take on&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dYe6y7"&gt;In the wake of the 2020 election, Democrats are looking for answers — and if you ask John Fetterman, the answer is marijuana. Pennsylvania’s unorthodox Lieutenant Governor has established himself as a kind of unofficial spokesman for the state’s efforts to legalize the drug, both in his public statements and on his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnfetterman"&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;. And while the issue makes many politicians nervous, Fetterman is insistent that it’s far more popular than they realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuepxS"&gt;“America wants this and is ready for this and has been ready for it,” Fetterman said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And no matter what it is that does it for you, whether it’s revenue, justice, jobs, freedom, farmers, veterans, there are so many reasons to support it. The only reason against it is this vestigial reefer madness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxOe8b"&gt;Fetterman is exasperated that neither Democrats nor Republicans seem to have the political will to make it happen, despite a recent groundswell of voter support. He and Governor Tom Wolf have repeatedly tried to push for state legislation in recent months, as it became clear neighboring New Jersey would soon pass a decriminalization bill of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSldFR"&gt;“We either do it now and take advantage of what we can do in Pennsylvania, or we’re going to lose a lot of revenue to our neighboring states,” Wolf said during an October press conference. Tax revenue from cannabis, Wolf argues, could prove invaluable for revitalizing Pennsylvania’s pandemic-ravaged economy. Leaders of the Republican-controlled state legislature however, have called legalizing &lt;a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2018/12/pa-senate-gop-leader-opposes-recreational-marijuana.html"&gt;recreational pot “reckless and irresponsible.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh2Y5F"&gt;Pennsylvania legalized medical marijuana in 2016 and opened its first dispensaries in 2018, but the drug is still illegal without a doctor’s approval. But as legalization gains ground across the country, there’s increasing pressure on states like Pennsylvania. As of this writing, medical marijuana is legal in 35 states; recreational weed is legal in 15 states and the District of Columbia, despite remaining illegal at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="spFQ0g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the unambiguous winner in November of 2020 was weed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WJWPXu"&gt;When he ran in the Senate primary in 2016, Fetterman says he was the only candidate nationally calling for legalization, a cause he has pushed in some form or other ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaX05K"&gt;“I don’t shrink away or call it ‘unfortunate’ or something,” he says of his party’s position on cannabis. “Thank goodness that Trump wasn’t savvy enough to say, ‘you know, what? legal weed!’ They can argue about what happened in the election in 2020. But the unambiguous winner in November of 2020 was weed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uph67Z"&gt;Indeed, in every state where marijuana legalization was on the ballot this year, people voted in favor. Arizona, Montana, and New Jersey voted to approve recreational cannabis sales to people 21 and over, while Mississippi voted to approved medical marijuana use. And perhaps even more significantly, the measures in Arizona and Montana both called for past marijuana-related crimes to be expunged from people’s records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CckFX0"&gt;Had President Trump prioritized legalization, Fetterman adds, he thinks the 2020 election would have turned out much worse for Democrats. “I think if Trump would have legalized weed and would have made a push for for pardons, and totally upended it and removed prohibition, I think he would have actually won quite handily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOve8g"&gt;Legalizing marijuana is not a new subject for Fetterman, who says he uses over-the-counter, THC-free CBD gummies and ointments for aches and pains and general well-being but does not smoke marijuana himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dww9i0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am honestly incensed that this was kept from me for my entire life because of reefer madness.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H9CKe1"&gt;“I am honestly incensed that this was kept from me for my entire life because of reefer madness,” he says. “And I find my outrage directed at the medical community too, that had no qualms about unleashing the Kraken on the American people with Oxycontin and opioids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXiAvP"&gt;Before he was elected lieutenant governor, Fetterman, who holds a master’s in public policy from Harvard and is known for his trademark wardrobe of a gray work shirt and cargo shorts, spent 13 years as the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania. The job paid $150 a year in a community where 35 percent of people live below the poverty line. He and his wife, Gisele, still live in Braddock with their three kids, and even though he holds statewide office now, Fetterman carries reminders of the borough on his skin. He has Braddock’s zip code tattooed on his left arm, and his right arm has the dates of nine of the ten homicides that occurred in Braddock during his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0YXLt"&gt;In the summer of 2019, Fetterman went on a listening tour across the commonwealth, visiting all 67 counties to find out whether there was in fact widespread support for legalizing recreational weed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdkwFc"&gt;“It was an earnest, goodwill, full on conversation, and by far the most interactive discussion of a public policy topic in Pennsylvania’s history, without a doubt,” he says. “And you know, I’m smart enough to know how to read an electoral map and I could have picked which counties I wanted. But I wanted to hear from everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88jBjy"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190925_Pennsylvania_Report_on_Adult_Use_Recreational_Marijuana-.pdf"&gt;report complied from Fetterman’s listening tour&lt;/a&gt;, 65 to 70 percent of Pennsylvanians said they approved of adult-use cannabis legalization. “And that’s what’s so crazy about it, is that there are so many what we call mainline Republicans in Pennsylvania that would love to just sit in their backyard by their fire pit after a long day and just take the edge off with a vape pen of weed,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4GEtX"&gt;And, he notes, Pennsylvania already has a thriving weed market, albeit an illegal one. “It’s a shit show, and it creates all kinds of externalities that people, especially people of color, are ground up by. And that needs to change,” he says. “We need to figure out a mechanism that balances the freedom and the distribution of it with the acknowledgement that it needs to generate revenue that can be used for the greater good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="evZmSR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration would leave it up to states to decide on legalizing recreational weed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CO3J7Y"&gt;Some of that enthusiasm has trickled up to the national level. &lt;a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/"&gt;The official 2020 Democratic Party platform&lt;/a&gt; calls for decriminalizing marijuana use via executive action and supports legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, but it leaves it up to states to decide whether to legalize weed for recreational use. During the campaign, President-elect &lt;a href="https://joebiden.com/justice/#"&gt;Joe Biden called for&lt;/a&gt; decriminalizing cannabis use, expunging prior convictions, and taking cannabis off the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6842187/drug-schedule-list-marijuana"&gt;schedule 1 drug list&lt;/a&gt; — which includes heroin and LSD — to allow research. But Biden would leave decisions about whether to legalize recreational marijuana up to states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSqa7r"&gt;Previous decriminalization bills have stalled out in Congress, with the Democratic-led House putting forth legislation only to see it die in the Senate. The House tried again to include banking reform for marijuana companies in a second coronavirus relief package in August, but the Trump administration and Senate Republicans balked. Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/cannabis-appears-more-job-democrats-new-stimulus-bill-1504393"&gt;Mitch McConnell scoffed that the bill&lt;/a&gt; “mentions the word cannabis 68 times, more than the words jobs or hire are mentioned in the entire bill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmYWQi"&gt;The House is&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/house-gets-ready-for-historic-vote-on-federal-marijuana-prohibition-192829701.html"&gt; expected to vote this week&lt;/a&gt; on a bill that would remove marijuana from the controlled substances list. The MORE Act, introduced by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), would effectively eliminate marijuana prohibition and require that federal courts expunge prior marijuana arrests from people’s criminal records. But getting the bill through Congress would require buy-in from Senate Republicans, who are unlikely to play ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xz17jz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“weed helped a lot of people get through this pandemic.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2BWBsx"&gt;Given the gridlock at the federal level, Fetterman worries that national Democrats will leave drug policy on the back burner. “I think they’re going to say ‘we have other priorities,’” Fetterman says. “And I’m thinking, ‘no, no you don’t,’ because weed helped a lot of people get through this pandemic. And it would help a lot of other people dial back their addictions to other things like opioids and alcohol and other things. It’s really the perfect time for it. And all it involves is saying ‘yes.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4m3C9"&gt;Fetterman believes that Illinois — which opened its first dispensaries for recreational use in January — is a model for Pennsylvania to pursue full legalization. Sales of marijuana in Illinois are likely to &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/cannabis/2020/12/2/22146660/illinois-weed-sales-could-top-1-billion-in-2020-expert-says"&gt;surpass $1 billion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, state officials say. Fetterman winces at what he sees as revenue left on the table in Pennsylvania; according to the auditor general, legal weed could bring &lt;a href="https://www.paauditor.gov/press-releases/auditor-general-depasquale-says-state-could-reap-581-million-annually-by-regulating-taxing-marijuana"&gt;$581 million a year into Pennsylvania’s coffers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="perZ8A"&gt;“I’m a realist, and it’s not like I can sit at a desk and craft [legislation] myself, this is going to have to involve by definition, the GOP,” Fetterman says. “And right now this is a party with its head in the sand trying to deny this even though they know we’re right about it. I don’t want the perfect to become the enemy of the good. But we’re not going to be able to get to where Illinois is anytime soon unless there’s a sea change in the Pennsylvania GOP mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIEPva"&gt;Republicans in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, however, are currently preoccupied with the state of the presidential election and Trump’s attempts to overturn his loss. Fetterman has been a reliably vocal critic, mocking the president and the GOP on his Twitter account and in interviews. “The echo chamber on the other side is so desperate to find something to excite and mollify the snake handlers in the party,” he says. “And they know, there isn’t one person in leadership that honestly believes any of it. It’s all just carnival barking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSuNzl"&gt;Still, Fetterman thinks both parties share some of the blame for failing to legalize cannabis, and he is particularly incensed that the segments of the party responsible for putting Biden in the White House continue to bear the brunt of the effects of drug laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DCBPe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the Democratic Party is to the right of South Dakota on legal weed, and it’s like, ‘what the hell is wrong with you?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNG01m"&gt;“I find the Democrats’ platform on it cowardly, and, on the wrong side of history,” he said. “So the Democratic Party is to the right of South Dakota on legal weed, and it’s like, ‘what the hell is wrong with you?’” Fetterman says. “The Democratic Party owes its electoral success in this election to Black and brown communities. And they are disgustingly, disproportionately impacted by weed prohibition more than anybody.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivso0S"&gt;Although he hasn’t committed to any specific race, observers think &lt;a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/toomey-exit-kick-starts-2022-guesswork-among-pa-politicos/"&gt;Fetterman is likely to run for Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA)’s Senate seat&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. (Toomey has said he won’t seek reelection.) That would put him in a much stronger position to advocate for permanent change to marijuana laws at the national level. But for now, he sees the issue of legalizing weed as an urgent matter for the Keystone State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="djv6NO"&gt;“Forty percent of our state is going to live a grocery store away from a Candyland of legal weed” in New Jersey, Fetterman said. “It’s inevitable. So you can either be rolled over by it or you can be a frontrunner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbixK7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lye5f6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="nlPYW8"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/return-to-bird-world"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return to Bird World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, players are brought back to the floating kingdom of Bird World thousands of years after the events of the original game to find the once-brilliant island has fallen into ruin. While the darker setting is a departure from &lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/bird-world"&gt;the original &lt;em&gt;Bird World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new game still has one key trait in common: it doesn’t actually exist. But its soundtrack does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrfHqM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return to Bird World &lt;/em&gt;comes from musician and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leyawn/status/585859882869469184"&gt;Twitter personality&lt;/a&gt; Leon Chang, who’s been releasing video game-inspired albums for the past few years. His first big project, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15479308/leyawn-twitter-bird-world-album-video-game-soundtrack"&gt;2017’s &lt;em&gt;Bird World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was ostensibly the soundtrack to an SNES-era game about a tiny bird embarking on an adventure. Even though you’ll never play it, the soundtrack offered an idea of what the nonexistent game might be about. You’d journey across a playful island, help out residents of a small village, and ultimately face a world-changing battle before saying goodbye to all the quirky characters you met along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5i9f2"&gt;Chang said the idea for making a fake soundtrack came out of the music to which he was already writing and listening. “I like to write music that sounds like it comes from a video game, so why not make an album that’s based around a fake video game?” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="urddwS"&gt;&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 472px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2542532920/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/return-to-bird-world"&gt;return to bird world by leon chang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFQK6M"&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the sequel, &lt;em&gt;Bird World &lt;/em&gt;has jumped to a new generation. The album has PlayStation-esque artwork and a sprawling length — an hour and a half — to match the expansive soundtracks that’d score games like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also more varied and less relentlessly cheery than the original. “The Mushroom God” seems to depict a melancholy deity whose land has fallen to ruin; “Sesame City” is fit for a bustling town with a futuristic edge; and “A World Descends Into Chaos” pretty much sounds like the name implies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OaXdx"&gt;Chang said he started planning a &lt;em&gt;Bird World &lt;/em&gt;sequel almost as soon as the original came out (he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leyawn/status/933806013349842945"&gt;teased a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; as far back as November 2017). Feedback on the original was good enough to warrant the sequel, he said, but there was also plenty more he wanted to do. While writing the first album, Chang found that he had ideas for more songs that, as an amateur musician, he was still figuring out how to actually create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZMNnF"&gt;“On &lt;em&gt;Bird World&lt;/em&gt;, I wish I could have done more orchestral stuff and more soundtrack-y type of stuff, and now I have the ability to do that,” Chang said. “This next album just feels like taking all of that into as big of a thing as I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4QqIy"&gt;The album came together with the help of a “long-running Google Doc” where Chang sketched out the plot, characters, and settings of &lt;em&gt;Return to Bird World&lt;/em&gt;. While you won’t get to read the whole thing, you can get some of the details from a 28-page game manual that accompanies the physical release of the album — a double CD package that’s likewise meant to emulate those classic PlayStation RPGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KOHnf9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;game manual teaser:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;table of contents~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;tracklist details~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;mastered by me&lt;br&gt;mixed by me&lt;br&gt;engineered by me&lt;br&gt;recorded at my house&lt;br&gt;saxophone on "a world descends into chaos" by steve pardo &lt;a href="https://t.co/yz3Mdd85jp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yz3Mdd85jp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— leon (@leyawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leyawn/status/1330240053956792320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 21, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rthjqP"&gt;Listeners won’t know the whole story by the time they’re finished, but Chang designed the album so that there’s a narrative running from beginning to end. “I’m hoping people can get some of [the plot] out of the tracks,” he said, “but a lot is left to the imagination still.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqO2Tr"&gt;Some tracks were created specifically to score locations or events Chang had in mind, while others started as songs that he later worked into the plot. Chang hired artists to create the album’s cover and the game manual illustrations (Aliana Wong and Titas Antanas Vilkaitis), and he wrote the copy himself. “I put all the copy and design together, and that took me forever to do,” Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1czxup"&gt;The result is another album that ought to leave you wishing you could play the game to which it belongs. The album &lt;a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com/album/return-to-bird-world"&gt;comes out today on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; and will be available on other streaming platforms starting Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit is replacing some Sense smartwatches over ECG reading issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ppt-hcNHSGu-aLtzckfRA2nG74w=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68454625/20200919FitbitSense5.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2xqO7q"&gt;Fitbit is contacting some owners of its Sense smartwatch to offer replacements after discovering a bug affecting its electrocardiogram (ECG) readings. Users on the &lt;a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sense/Is-this-Fitbit-email-about-the-Sense-real/td-p/4597706"&gt;Fitbit forums&lt;/a&gt; have reported receiving emails from the company, warning that their devices are affected by an unspecified “hardware issue.” Fitbit has subsequently confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the issue specifically affects its ECG functionality. The emails ask affected users to return the smartwatch to Fitbit, and says they will be given a replacement device free of charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3NOPA"&gt;Along with stress detection and temperature tracking, the Fitbit Sense’s ECG app is one of its major differentiating features compared to Fitbit’s other recent smartwatch; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;the Versa 3&lt;/a&gt;. The ECG feature is meant to allow the watch to read the wearer’s heart rhythm for problems like atrial fibrillation. Although it wasn’t available when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;reviewed the smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; back in September, Fitbit rolled out its &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-ecg-app-rollout-071725627.html"&gt;ECG app the following month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rl7ZIy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A small number of devices are thought to be affected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw52Dd"&gt;When contacted for comment, a Fitbit UK spokesperson confirmed the issue to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and said that the problem affects the ECG app on a limited number of Sense devices. The problem means the app can incorrectly display an “inconclusive” result during readings. Fitbit has also confirmed that no other devices, or future Sense smartwatches shipments, are affected by the issue and said it is contacting affected users directly to issue replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiIgfj"&gt;The $329.95 Fitbit Sense has had a bit of a rough launch. Some of its most impressive features weren’t available in time for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, and what was left could be buggy to use. But so far Fitbit has shown it’s willing to address these issues. It’s released updates to add new features like the ECG app and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574837/fitbit-sense-versa-3-google-assistant-voice-calls-text-messages-speech-spo2-monitoring-bloody-oxygen"&gt;support for Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s proactively replacing devices with faulty hardware. In our review we said Fitbit needed to take some time to work out the Sense’s kinks, and it appears to be doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tszpr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lIzwa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Tomahawk modular gaming PC is finally a real product</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6HrTF6T1sMERi18IF0niEFx_Q-I=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68453427/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_hc7_h73_9122164572190_Tomahawk_Gaming_Desktop_1500x1000_20201204_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8cUWP1"&gt;Razer has been talking up modular gaming PCs with streamlined swappable parts for years. Now, after various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285130/razer-reveals-project-christine-the-concept-gaming-pc-even-a-toddler"&gt;concepts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054602/razer-tomahawk-desktop-gaming-pc-intel-nuc-element-design-specs-ces-2020"&gt;CES reveals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/10/21510415/razer-tomahawk-pc-case-atx-matx-itx-mini-sff-third-attempt"&gt;standard PC cases with associated branding&lt;/a&gt;, the company is actually selling a pre-built desktop PC for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5rgQo"&gt;The Tomahawk is the final version of what we saw at CES 2020 back in January. It’s a simple case design with two PCIe slots: one for a full-sized GPU, and one for an Intel NUC Element board that contains the CPU, the RAM, the storage, and basically everything else you need for a functional PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEyZSB"&gt;The NUC module includes a 45W Core i9-9980HK Coffee Lake processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB hard drive. The memory and storage are upgradable, but the CPU is not — unless Intel releases another compatible NUC board that you can swap directly into the Tomahawk. That Coffee Lake CPU is the kind of part you might find in a high-end gaming laptop, so while it’s fast today it may well be something you’d want to upgrade down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW7_wYmVrCvyRQdmFdEf6D4IOdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22143486/Screen_Shot_2020_12_04_at_14.46.22.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmn0YV"&gt;The Tomahawk does have space for a full-size GPU up to 320 x 140mm and there’s an option to order it with an Nvidia RTX 3080 Founders Edition pre-installed. The 210mm x 365mm x 150mm metal chassis is 10L in capacity, comes with a 750W PSU, and uses active cooling. There are 4 USB-A 3.2 ports and 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, as well as onboard Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 Razer says the small size is designed for bringing to tournaments and LAN parties or just freeing up desk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjtexr"&gt;You’ll have to really value those attributes for the Tomahawk to be worth it, because unsurprisingly it does not come cheap. Razer has priced it at $2,400 for the base model without a discrete GPU or $3,200 with a RTX 3080; &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-desktops-and-cases%2Frazer-tomahawk-gaming-desktop%2FRZ42-03650200-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorders&lt;/a&gt; have opened in the US, but it’s currently listed as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new true wireless earbuds have noise cancellation and low latency for mobile games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UXvJclVsKwVtjkgO93nVITCMEPw=/0x46:2040x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452999/razer1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJf9SL"&gt;Razer released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937068/razer-truly-wireless-headphones-hammerhead-bluetooth-5-earbuds-android-gaming-mode-price"&gt;first set of true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, with the main appeal being a low-latency mode that made them better suited for mobile gaming. Now, the company is ready with its second pair, the Hammerhead True Wireless Pro, which go on sale today for $199.99 and add active noise cancellation and THX audio certification to the mix. “The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro uses hybrid ANC to nullify both external and unwanted internal noise by generating inverse sound waves simultaneously,” Razer wrote in its press release for the new buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXDYiH"&gt;Passive noise isolation also helps there, and Razer has switched to a proper in-ear design — unlike the AirPods-esque open style of the original Hammerhead True Wireless. (There’s a “quick attention mode” for piping in outside audio when you want to hear what’s happening near you.) Along with the usual silicone options (&lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; different sets of them), the company is including a set of medium Comply foam ear tips in the box to help you get the most secure, sealed-off fit possible to better enhance sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZdQ2GpN9B1kudk5-R462AHDCcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141206/tips.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer includes six sets of silicone tips and Comply foam right in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYaFLI"&gt;The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, and Razer says they last up to 20 hours total with the case factored in; the earbuds can make it through four hours of continuous listening, which is about an hour below competitors like the AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. There’s also no wireless charging, which is disappointing to see at this level. You control the buds with the touch-sensitive Razer logo button on each one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqWlYD"&gt;As for the THX certification, Razer says “fine details such as frequency range and response are evaluated, and the device must be capable of delivering clear, detailed vocals and deep impactful bass with zero distortion at high volumes.” The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro feature 10mm drivers and still include a Game Mode that the company claims can cut latency in half “compared to other true wireless earbuds supporting SBC / AAC codecs.” Razer isn’t alone in offering a low-latency mode; Samsung and OnePlus also reduce the response time for audio effects in games when you use their respective earbuds and phones together. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4MX2h_-KsySc2ZPmaX3xd4U56iM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141245/razer2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1aF0T9"&gt;The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro have a price fitting of their name, $199.99, which puts them firmly in the upper tier of true wireless earbuds. That’s slightly below the usual cost of Sony’s 1000XM3 earbuds or newer options like the Jabra Elite 85t, but holiday deals and discounts will probably end up putting all of these on equal footing. I’ll be checking them out over the coming days to see how they stack up against the noise-canceling competition for gaming purposes and everything else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raise your hand if ‘Cash App launches a clothing line’ was on your 2020 bingo card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A 3D model wearing a 3D model of the clothing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/od8VmjNTZq22bRtdKHP9aCYJzUo=/72x0:2604x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452859/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_4.00.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s staring into my soul.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cash App&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="19Y4Xx"&gt;If you’ve ever used Cash App and thought “wow, I wish I could put this on my body...” we may need to talk about your relationship with apps. But also you’re in luck! The payment service announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/status/1334558085621407747"&gt;in a tweet today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s launching its own apparel line, called (what else) Cash. According to its website, the apparel line will follow the standard streetwear release model of “limited edition drops”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBVR2c"&gt;If you follow &lt;a href="http://cashbycashapp.com"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; from the tweet, you’ll first be subjected to some creepy 3D models — you can click on them to make them dance — before you actually get to &lt;a href="https://shop.cash.app/"&gt;the shop&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, you can browse the “fits” (as I’ve heard the kids calling them). If you need a new T-shirt, sweatshirt, jacket, or pair of pants, and for some reason don’t mind being a walking billboard for a company that makes money when you spend money, you can, of course, buy one using your Cash Card. You’ll even get an extra 25 percent off if you use its service instead of a credit card. And, if you’re worried about getting chilly from the ice-cold look you’ll soon be rocking, &lt;a href="https://shop.cash.app/product/cash-app-fc-scarf/52?cp=true&amp;amp;sa=false&amp;amp;sbp=false&amp;amp;q=false&amp;amp;category_id=20"&gt;you can even get a scarf.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your 7-year fear of Americans legally getting to make in-flight calls has come to an end</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="airplane southwest airlines stock 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogddw14drW6YdXso47Ka2RT0LTc=/0x19:1024x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452820/airplane-southwest-1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HTjkxz"&gt;The next time you get on a plane, you’ll probably have plenty of new things to worry about, but having to listen to people talking on the phone won’t be one. Way back in 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5134656/fcc-confirms-it-may-allow-cellular-calls-during-flight"&gt;the FCC announced &lt;/a&gt;that it would be considering removing a ban on passengers making phone calls once the plane was above 10,000 feet. The proposal was unpopular even within the FCC, with &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/chi-fcc-chairman-not-a-fan-of-calls-on-planes-20131122-story.html#axzz2lQkTJIYu"&gt;then-Chairman Tom Wheeler saying&lt;/a&gt; he would prefer people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be allowed to make calls on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hp8X93"&gt;The FCC originally announced that it would be considering the proposal on December 12 (of 2013), but it &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-terminates-onboard-aircraft-proceeding"&gt;took until today&lt;/a&gt; to reach a verdict (&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/12/03/fcc-cancels-proposal-to-allow-cell-phone-calls-during-flight.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The decision cites “strong opposition,” especially among pilots and flight attendants, claiming that the proposal “[failed] to address significant safety and national security concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11tnbp"&gt;There are also concerns that the proposal would make flights less pleasant to be on. &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filing/6017589037"&gt;One of the letters referenced&lt;/a&gt; by the FCC was filed by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), and says that the proposal “jeopardize[s] safety and comfort on board our aircraft.” This is also the sentiment I’ve gathered from &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=13-301&amp;amp;sort=date_disseminated,DESC&amp;amp;submissiontype_description=COMMENT"&gt;the public comments I’ve read&lt;/a&gt;: who wants to add “many people talking loudly on their phones” to the list of terrible airplane noises?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Comment on the FCC’s website asking if the people making the proposal “are smoking crack”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ClNvWjcXjCBsu8bufb91Q-uXSvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22143017/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_5.50.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over 1,300 people commented on the proposal, with many expressing that they weren’t interested in having to hear people talk on their phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v2C29o"&gt;Even though it took seven years, I’m glad the FCC is taking what seems to be the obviously correct step here. Like the AFPA says, “just because something is technically feasible does not automatically mean it should be considered for public policy.” In other words: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/26/5245354/how-would-in-flight-calling-actually-work"&gt;even if you can&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t mean you should. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can play Cyberpunk 2077 on December 9th instead of 10th, depending where you live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8n-PWmagzASMgUnrzBT16x3znUo=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452756/screen_image_about_768457e5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FndB3K"&gt;The highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is just days away from its December 10th release. But depending on where you live and what platform you’re playing on, you might get to play the game a bit earlier than you might have expected given the previous guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7BWq5"&gt;Developer CD Projekt Red shared exactly when &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will be available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1334548241459933188"&gt;in a tweet posted Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re playing on PC or Stadia, you’ll be able to start the game at 12AM GMT on December 10th no matter where you are in the world. That means, for example, that if you live on the US East Coast, you can jump into the game at 7PM ET on December 9th. If you want to know exactly when 12AM GMT is in your timezone, check the map below. Console players will get access to the game at midnight local time, according to CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BaYVyr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The wait is almost over!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're looking to play &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cyberpunk2077?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Cyberpunk2077&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it's available, here's a map with global release timings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For PC and Stadia players, the release is simultaneous and scheduled for midnight GMT, and for all console players – midnight local time. &lt;a href="https://t.co/W0QLIFAhH1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/W0QLIFAhH1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1334548241459933188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTIOC2"&gt;CD Projekt Red also detailed when you can start preloading &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; ahead of next week’s launch. On PC, you can preload the game beginning Monday, December 7th. Preloads begin at 12PM CET on GOG and at 5PM CET on Steam and the Epic Games Store. On Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles, you can already preload the game. On PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, preloads begin “two days prior to the release date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed1eQw"&gt;It’s been a long wait for people anticipating &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, as the game has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069016/cyberpunk-2077-new-release-date-date-delay-september-cd-projekt-red"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295705/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-again-release-date-november-19th-bug-fixes-balance-cd-projekt-red"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;. The specifics about release timing seem to suggest that the full game will, at long last, finally be in players’ hands very soon. Technically, the game discs went gold in October and a few of them &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-street-date-has-been-broken/"&gt;are actually already in players’ hands&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s apparently going to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1334219336383418371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1334224744741281797%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fcyberpunk-2077s-street-date-has-been-broken%2F"&gt;a hefty day-one patch&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>God of War’s Kratos is now available in Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0JMWot_N1dHWAnbctNOAse9waM8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452572/fortnite_kratos_outfit_1920x1080_693045884.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecGJ7g"&gt;After a not-so-subtle tease from Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22102623/god-of-wars-kratos-fortnite-skin-rumor-leak-playstation-5"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; protagonist Kratos is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/kratos-joins-the-hunt-in-fortnite-chapter-2-season-5?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt; as a purchasable skin in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Although Kratos is a Sony character, he’s not exclusive to PS4 or PS5 platforms — you’ll be able to buy the Kratos skin on any platform where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; can be played, and players on all platforms will be able to see Kratos in-game, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9VWJA"&gt;We should note that there is one PlayStation-exclusive thing about Kratos, though — if you play a match as Kratos on PlayStation 5, you’ll unlock the Armored Kratos Style:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zaEurNli-jp9rWVTyWBkjklSbnU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142841/fortnite_kratos_armored_style_outfit_1920x1080_693045924.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kratos in his Armored Kratos style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uNMMPY"&gt;For 2,200 V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game currency, you get the Kratos skin, a glider, a Mimir back bling, and the Leviathan Axe pickaxe (which comes with an emote). You can also buy the skin and the back bling as a bundle for 1,500 V-Bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BHotk"&gt;Sony and Epic Games put together &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1334648614791094274"&gt;a short trailer&lt;/a&gt; to help hype up Kratos’ debut:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YynUTW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“The best hunters across all realities,” you say? We might know a guy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kratos arrives in Fortnite with Guardian Shield Glider, Mimir Back Bling, and Leviathan Axe Pickaxe: &lt;a href="https://t.co/cKF8pDJLDl"&gt;https://t.co/cKF8pDJLDl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZNX4H6MzEd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZNX4H6MzEd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1334650229157715968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YVGLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; newest season just launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, and it features hunters from different realities as collectible skins you can earn from the game’s seasonal battle pass (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;the Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt; and his constant companion Grogu, aka Baby Yoda). Kratos is a fitting addition to the lineup, though he may not be the only video game crossover we see this season — rumors point to Microsoft icon Master Chief &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22150252/fortnite-halo-infinite-master-chief-leak-microsoft-xbox"&gt;possibly joining the game&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
