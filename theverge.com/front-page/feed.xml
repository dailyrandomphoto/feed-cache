    <title>The AirPods Pro’s force sensor is a more comfortable way to control audio</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WjhY2z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; cleverly solve one of the trickiest parts of earbud design with a unique button — even if it’s not technically a button at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKi4jL"&gt;Officially referred to as the “force sensor” (a title that makes the button sound far more interesting than it actually is), it’s technically nothing more than an indented portion of the AirPods Pro’s stems, with some fancy hardware that measures not just capacitive touch but also pressure. But the faux-buttons solve one of the most annoying things about earbuds: how to control them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SSF7c8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A smart solution for a more recent problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wF9nN8"&gt;The issue of controlling truly wireless earbuds is a relatively new one. Older in-ear headphones often included a row of buttons on their wires, which allowed for volume and playback controls to be placed in a spot that’s easy to reach and find. But in-ear wireless earbuds don’t leave a lot of space for buttons, joysticks, or control wheels to manipulate playback, forcing manufacturers to come up with alternate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ry-XASBpDsHpD2CY_IGMMPv1QD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539213/vpavic_4603_20210525_0020_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hQSlsa"&gt;Touch controls, employed by headphones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;regular AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, have emerged as the most common answer. Tap, double tap, or triple tap your earbuds, and you’ll be able to play, pause, and skip around your tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAjnnr"&gt;The problem, though, is that in-ear headphones — as the name suggests — are already nestled pretty firmly into your ear. And tap controls mean that you’re either shoving those earbuds further into your ear (painfully so, sometimes) or dislodging them entirely, at which point you’re risking loss or damage when your expensive buds plummet to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv9w0A"&gt;Apple avoids both of those problems with the force sensor. Instead of putting pressure on your ear, Apple has users squeeze the stem of the AirPod. It’s a far gentler movement that doesn’t move the earbud as much, reducing both the risk of discomfort and dislodging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyBe0o_QmVvM29cY0XkZl66-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539210/vpavic_4603_20210525_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EOET2D"&gt;Its controls are pretty similar to the other methods of headphone control: one squeeze to toggle play / pause, two to skip forward a track, and three to skip back. There’s also a fourth long press, which toggles the various noise cancellation modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0W4DZ"&gt;The whole design guides you through how to use them, too. The indented pad makes it clear where to press to activate the “button,” while the requirement for some slight force makes it hard to trigger unintentionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD1kZh"&gt;And while there’s no &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; haptic feedback from the force sensor, Apple does some masterful work in tricking your brain that there is, through clever clicking sound effects relayed through the earbuds to make it feel like you’re pressing a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga9LqW"&gt;The controls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458155/new-airpods-pro-2022-fitness-release-dates-report-design-features"&gt;might not be long for this world&lt;/a&gt; — Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022"&gt;rumored to be testing a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro that would remove the stem (and the force sensor) entirely. It’d be a disappointing change, given that the force sensor isn’t just a great control method; the AirPod stems are one of the more recognizable parts of the product, so much so that it’s the main thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;copycat designs&lt;/a&gt; tend to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhNoli"&gt;Is it a lot of engineering work for a relatively simple function? Undoubtedly. But it makes a crucial part of operating the AirPods a seamless, aesthetically pleasing, and comfortable process. And what more can you ask than that?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We have bigger problems than COVID-19’s origins  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RcYVtpSTwb531MQ_wmVSqFUQgnU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69356018/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGuT9W"&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic scales down in the United States, debates around the origins of the virus — and speculations that it came from a lab in China, not an animal — rumbled back to life. And they’re diverting attention to the wrong places. Focusing on where the virus came from is a distraction from the rest of the urgent work governments and health agencies around the world need to do in order to end this pandemic and prepare for the next one. We don’t need a consensus on the origins of COVID-19 in order to take steps to strengthen global public health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdK4Es"&gt;That doesn’t mean finding out where the coronavirus came from isn’t important. It’s one of the pieces of information that could &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fwe-still-dont-know-the-origins-of-the-coronavirus-here-are-four-scenarios&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458230%2Fcovid-origins-lab-leak-biden-vaccines-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;give us tools&lt;/a&gt; to prevent a similar situation from happening again. Saying that the coronavirus came from a lab rather than an animal is an extraordinary claim; it would require extraordinary evidence to be proven true. Both scenarios are still technically &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, even if a lab leak is &lt;a href="https://massivesci.com/articles/sars-cov-coronavirus-covid19-lab-leak-hypothesis/"&gt;far less&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/27/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask#many-scientists-welcomed-bidens-call-for-a-rigorous-inquiry-of-a-chinese-lab-but-they-said-the-theory-remained-unlikely"&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;. And there are &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1"&gt;serious scientists who are calling for a serious investigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGxiY9"&gt;After renewed attention — though, notably, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/05/27/wuhan-lab-theory-evidence/"&gt;little new data&lt;/a&gt; — on the theory that the outbreak started after the virus was accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/26/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-investigation-into-the-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that he’s asking United States intelligence agencies to redouble efforts to figure out the origins of the coronavirus. In 90 days, he wants to see a report “that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion” on how the virus jumped to humans, sparking the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvHZb1"&gt;Taking a methodical, dispassionate approach to tracking the origins of the coronavirus could take many times longer than Biden’s proposed 90 days, assuming there’s ever conclusive proof at all. It took around 14 years to figure out where the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07766-9"&gt;SARS virus&lt;/a&gt; came from. Tracing the origins of the 1918 flu pandemic took &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/1/05-0979_article"&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don’t know where Ebola outbreaks come from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vt9Du4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientists &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don’t know where Ebola outbreaks come from&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhiovB"&gt;There are other things we could focus on that might not take quite as long and can provide sure results. Countries like the US could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/rich-countries-cornered-covid-19-vaccine-doses-four-strategies-right-scandalous"&gt;double down on efforts&lt;/a&gt; to distribute life-saving COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries. Wealthy countries snapped up the lion’s share of the doses —and so far, 85 percent of vaccinations have been given there. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, called it a “moral failure.” The pandemic is still an urgent threat in places &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-coronavirus-vaccine-coronavirus-pandemic-business-government-and-politics-2d5eab50c1ef8bd63b1a48331f4c3025"&gt;without enough shots&lt;/a&gt; for healthcare workers. If the virus is still spreading in those countries, the pandemic isn’t over. As long as it spreads, it can mutate and be a threat everywhere — even in places with high rates of immunization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSSMzl"&gt;The US could also turn inward, and take a full account of the ways in which our public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic went horribly wrong. We could focus on shoring up our public health infrastructure and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412046/hopsital-infrastructure-health-care-system-pandemic-coordination-covid"&gt;improving our hospital systems&lt;/a&gt; so they’ll hold up under a surge of sick people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeGeum"&gt;We could even use the time to take a look at lab safety practices. “Let’s stipulate that pandemics can result from natural spillovers or from laboratory accidents—and then let’s move along to implications,” Daniel Engber &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/chinese-lab-leak-hypothesis-coronavirus/619000/"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lab screw-ups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/31/7474365/after-several-bioharazous-screw-ups-the-cdc-hires-a-safety-chief"&gt;happen&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re scary. People are particularly spooked by research that alters viruses to make them deadlier or more transmissible, which is done in some US labs. Well before the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00210-5"&gt;experts questioned&lt;/a&gt; if there was enough oversight of those experiments. Even if a lab leak wasn’t involved in this particular pandemic, it might be worth strengthening policies around dangerous pathogens &lt;em&gt;anyhow&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PS8nkG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Finding the source of COVID-19 pandemic won’t bring back the nearly 600,000 people in the US who died from the disease&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tIf9kr"&gt;Finding the source of COVID-19 pandemic won’t bring back the nearly 600,000 people in the US who died from the disease. The virus itself isn’t the only reason why they’re gone — they died because the pandemic was bungled through a combination of bad leadership, poor communication, and decades of cuts to the country’s public health infrastructure. A viral outbreak is hazardous, but it only became such a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528752/election-2020-public-health-coronavirus-pandemic-trump-cdc"&gt;magnificent disaster&lt;/a&gt; because of how people responded to it. Figuring out how to prevent a future viral outbreak from turning into this scale of a disaster is a better use of our limited time and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5X0DuN"&gt;That so many people are quick to assume intentional wrongdoing or neglect led to the initial outbreaks of the virus, though, shows how much trust in public institutions eroded over the past year. It’s for a good reason: China &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; attempt to downplay the pandemic and is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/world/asia/wuhan-china-coronavirus.html"&gt;working to paint&lt;/a&gt; its COVID-19 response as a victory. There were mistakes from groups like the World Health Organization, which was slow to recognize the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00810-9"&gt;ventilation&lt;/a&gt;, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/27/cdc-latest-blunder-about-trust-not-masks/?utm_content=bufferd79c7&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter_organic"&gt;screwed up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206728/cloth-face-masks-white-house-coronavirus-covid-cdc-messaging"&gt;messaging&lt;/a&gt; around masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIjz0J"&gt;The terrifying mistakes made by public health officials, researchers, and politicians are things we should be honest about. We can take the fears that make people want to investigate the lab leak idea seriously. But we don’t need to know where the virus came from to deal with those issues — and they’ll be key to rebuilding trust, which we need for the next pandemic. Once the world is vaccinated, we should. But first, let’s try to keep as many people alive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBVjqp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ4FyH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISwgMe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phones to buy if you’re a phone enthusiast</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Come make bad decisions with us&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mWHafX"&gt;There are plenty of buying guides for figuring out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;best phone to buy&lt;/a&gt; at a given time, across a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;wide variety of prices&lt;/a&gt;. We have two of them, in fact. But if you’re a dyed-in-the-wool phone enthusiast, you don’t need a guide that’s going to give you the best rational recommendation. You need something that’s going to help you scratch your new gadget itch in the most satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwnkhO"&gt;I’m here for you because, well, I’m one of you. This is the internet’s premiere buying guide for phone enthusiasts. We’re not going to focus on practical, rational choices, nor are we going to concern ourselves with budgets. These are the dream phones, the ones you buy not as a utilitarian tool, but for the fun of playing with a new piece of tech that you’ll probably sell or trade in for a loss in six months. I’m not even going to single out a specific model that you should buy, because you’re likely buying a new phone every year (or maybe more!) anyway. This is all about throwing caution to the wind, diving deep into a hobby, and buying something you don’t need but absolutely want. Budgets be damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEMlHI"&gt;Grab your cargo shorts, we’re going shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wpvKLT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best phone to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"},{"title":"The best smartphone you can buy for under $500","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6NT2gW"&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HQWhbW"&gt;The best folding phone because you know you need one in your collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cyP7p8"&gt;Folding phones are the future, right? You can’t call yourself a Real Phone Enthusiast without one in your life. Hands down, the best folding phone you can buy right now is Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. It’s got everything you might want from a modern smartphone, but it also opens up into a tablet-sized screen that lets you put more than one app side-by-side or look at a giant version of Google Maps. It’s easy to justify because you can tell yourself that you will get SO MUCH WORK done on it, right after you finish watching that YouTube video. Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8bHVj"&gt;The Fold 2 costs more than most laptops, you have to baby it, and there’s a really good chance the screen will crack or break on you even if you are careful, but that’s just the price you have to pay to be on the bleeding edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jGK8Wn"&gt;The best iPhone for when you’re double-fisting an Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="odv92P"&gt;Look, I know that you know that everyone in the world has an iPhone and it’s the farthest thing from an “interesting” phone. But at the same time, it’s hard to ignore what Apple’s doing, and really, iMessage and the Apple Watch are pretty great. Lots of people carry an iPhone alongside an Android phone, and you could be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgHcF9"&gt;The best iPhone for doing this is the iPhone 12 Mini. It does everything its bigger siblings can do, but it can easily fit in a secondary pocket and isn’t a burden to carry around. The battery life is kinda lousy, but who cares, that’s why you have a second phone on you anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QAq06D"&gt;The best phone for seeing what this “gaming phone” trend is all about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DYsaub"&gt;Gaming phones are so hot right now (unless they’ve got a great cooling system) — it seems like a new model is released every three months. You can’t call yourself a true phone enthusiast without being up on this trend, and the best one to dip your toes into it with is the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUdoj9"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of features that can make any mobile accomplisher swoon. A massive battery. A ridiculously high refresh screen. An OLED screen on the back you can customize to show whatever you want. A bunch of accessories to make gaming better. 18GB of RAM! How could you not buy this phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UxUeAC"&gt;The best phone for pretending you’re going to use a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="62OqLx"&gt;Writing on a phone screen with a pen is so cool! It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; futuristic and is just so natural. At least, it is for the first week until you forget about it and it never leaves the little garage built into the side of the phone again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYMIss"&gt;If you’ve been telling yourself that little “I’m gonna be a stylus person” lie, you need a phone that supports one and it’s hard to see buying anything other than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20. It’s got a low latency S Pen, a bunch of software features that can utilize the stylus, and all of the other bells and whistles of a modern smartphone, which means it works quite well long after you’ve forgotten about the stylus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hZjFO7"&gt;The best phone for messing around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnkTF"&gt;Okay, I said I wasn’t going to recommend anything rational in this guide, but this is perhaps the recommendation that makes the most sense: if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442051/android-12-beta-download-google-io-2021"&gt;mess around with the Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt; but don’t want to install it on your main phone, you should just buy a Google Pixel 4A. It’s only $350 (that’s just $20 more than it costs to fix a broken screen on an iPhone 12 Pro Max) and can work with Google’s latest and greatest software even before it’s released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QeuvA"&gt;You know the Android betas are going to be messy — battery life is going to be bad, there will be lots of bugs, certain apps might not work correctly — so you don’t want to put it on a device you actually need to rely on. Once the beta period is over, the Pixel 4A is a great device for experimenting with the aftermarket ROM world. Get a Pixel 4A and flash those ROMs to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrmHOI"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="eiZDop"&gt;The best phone for making people go “Whoa, is that a phone?”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zcDQoO"&gt;As a phone enthusiast, you already know this harsh truth: the Microsoft Surface Duo is not a good phone. It has an old processor. The camera is worse than any iPhone of the past five years. The battery life is decidedly Not Great. It gets hot doing simple tasks. There are SO MANY software bugs. It’s got a generation-old version of Android. It doesn’t even support wireless charging or NFC payments! Oh yeah, and there’s that questionable build quality to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J93WFK"&gt;But there’s something undeniably cool about the Surface Duo, like it’s a device from the future coming here to bless us in the early 21st century. It’s so thin, it has two screens, the hinge is incredibly neat. Open it up in public and you’re sure to get someone to ask “wow, is that a phone?” which we all know is the ultimate goal here. You can then show them all of its cool features, right after it’s done rebooting itself for the fifth time that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qGH04z"&gt;The best phone for telling yourself that you don’t need an actual camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rwPQXC"&gt;For years now we’ve been told that phone cameras are so good that you don’t need an actual camera. The iPhone 12 Pro Max might be the best example of that yet. It’s got a bigger sensor! It’s got three focal lengths! It can shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIhX55"&gt;At the end of the day, it’s still a phone camera and can’t really hold a candle to the image quality or creative control you get with a larger mirrorless camera. But hey, it’s fun to live in that lie and you can totally see the difference between the 12 Pro Max images and other phones. When you blow them up on a big screen. And zoom in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KwtDVn"&gt;The best phone for saying “you can’t get this in the US”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oAaPTd"&gt;Perhaps the ultimate phone flex is pulling a phone out of your pocket that nobody else is going to have. If you’re in the US, the Oppo Find X3 Pro is that phone. It’s got features you can’t get on any American phone and a design you won’t see everywhere, like a microscope camera and softly rounded camera bump. Sure, it won’t really work great on the cellular networks here, importing it is an expensive hassle, and you won’t have any warranty whatsoever. But just think of the envy on your friends’ faces when you tell them they can’t have this phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fsQZrc"&gt;The best phone for when you realize that Pixel phones aren’t great, but you don’t want a Samsung either&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LwpXZ"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones have such great software and then… mediocre everything else. Samsung phones have incredible hardware but are laden with heavy software and actual ads inside of the stock apps. The OnePlus 9 Pro splits that difference — it has software that’s similar to Google’s on hardware that’s virtually a Samsung with a different logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMwn3Y"&gt;The 9 Pro is just what the phone enthusiast ordered: a high-end, bells-and-whistles device with All Of The Specs but none of the cruft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yVVHIu"&gt;The best weekend phone for when you’re “disconnecting”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4j7b9k"&gt;Here comes the weekend, with all of its promises of relaxation and enjoyment. You don’t need a phone that’s going to make you more productive, you need something that’s going to slip into your pocket and won’t distract you with a colorful display unless you absolutely need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhFwR6"&gt;The Z Flip 5G is this phone. You can flip it closed to ignore it and then pop it open and have a full smartphone inside, complete with every feature you get on non-flippy phones. You’re making a compromise without &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; making a compromise, because we all know that you had no intention of actually disconnecting for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s Base Station Pro is back down to its lowest price this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Base Station Pro can recharge up to three devices simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MgYCFB"&gt;Memorial Day is Monday, May 31st, but many of the best deals are already kicking off. Stay tuned for an upcoming post that’ll show you everything that’s worth checking out on sale, whether you’re interesting in headphones, TVs, video games, or something else. Also, it’s worth keeping in mind that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; appears to be coming soon, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This hasn’t been confirmed yet by Amazon, but if you’re a Prime member, maybe go ahead and mark June 21st and June 22nd in your calendar. Until then, we’ve got some great deals highlighted below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lrqUb3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nEFFG"&gt;Nomad’s Base Station Pro is half off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FYlCvt"&gt;For those still looking to fill the Apple AirPower-shaped hole in their hearts, Nomad’s Base Station Pro is a wireless charging pad that makes for a pretty good alternative. It usually costs $200, but &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can get it right now for half that cost by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This deal will last through Saturday, May 29th at 11:59PM PT (2:59AM ET), if it doesn’t sell out first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XeSdTD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HreUgJ"&gt;The Base Station Pro can charge up to three devices at the same time wirelessly, and what’s even more appealing is that you don’t have to arrange them in a particular way on the pad. It has Aira FreePower charging coils inside, which, compared to traditional coil design, apparently allow for a better and more reliable charging connection. In the words of my colleague Chaim Gartenberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;who reviewed it in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, “There’s no hunting for a ‘sweet spot’ when placing devices on the Base Station Pro — just drop your phone, headphone case, or whatever other Qi device you’re charging on the leather surface, and it’ll charge.” You can also add a mount that lets you charge an Apple Watch for $5, though that requires using the charging cable that came with the Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ycL96ReSCqTu4B5KKt2LYthrg0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21813016/cgartenberg_200824_4157_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Nnb34"&gt;If you place just an iPhone down on the Base Station Pro, it’ll recharge at up to 7.5W of power, but Android phones are limited to 5W. If you’re charging multiple Apple devices, you’ll also be limited to 5W wireless charging. The Base Station Pro isn’t compatible with the Google Pixel 5, however, or the Pixel Buds that include a wireless charging case, but it should work with most other wireless charging devices, including Samsung phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7gjkE"&gt;Nomad also recently improved on (but didn’t totally remedy) a major flaw of the Base Station Pro that didn’t arise until the iPhone 12 series phones launched. The iPhone 12’s MagSafe magnet caused problems for the Aira FreePower tech, which resulted in recharge times that were doubled in length compared to previous Qi-ready iPhones. However, &lt;a href="https://www.pntra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeDeals+&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fpages%2Ffreepower-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad recently released a firmware &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/pages/freepower-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; that shortens the recharge time, though charging an iPhone 12 series still takes longer than other phones on the Base Station Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9CMkjJ"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 is noticeably smaller than the iPhone 11." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQSBc8E-OX_DqbGoG66w5NH3d_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973523/vpavic_4243_20201017_0014.0.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pbcMBD"&gt;Apple’s 20W USB-C charger and cable are discounted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ceA0i4"&gt;At Daily Steals, you can save on a bundle that contains Apple’s 20W USB-C wall adapter and its USB-C to Lightning cable. Normally $40 for both directly from Apple, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-20w-usb-c-power-adapter-usb-c-to-lightning-cable-bundle%3Fvariant%3D39311427207255&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22456723%2Fnomad-base-station-pro-qi-charger-pad-playstation-gift-card-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them for just $15&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEUSBC&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want two, then you’ll save more. Double your cart quantity and your checkout price will only be $26.24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BCjXjY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony / Insomniac Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LXWwAF"&gt;You can also save on a $50 PlayStation gift card&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh0il1"&gt;If you’re in the mood to check out another exclusive deal, digital storefront Eneba is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a sweet price cut on a $50 gift card to be used on either the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5. To claim the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals052821&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-50-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fjetpak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;visit Eneba, click “Buy Now”&lt;/a&gt;, and type in the offer code &lt;strong&gt;50USDVERGE&lt;/strong&gt;. The price should fall by a handful of bucks, and while the exact price might fluctuate, it won’t be more than $43 and change. This deal ends on May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft warns of ‘sophisticated’ Russian email attack targeting government agencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20fLvEOLQ86Yrw6I0TOPBWrU0LY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69355873/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="peqCRu"&gt;Microsoft has raised the alarm over a “&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F05%2F27%2Fnew-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sophisticated&lt;/a&gt;” ongoing cyberattack believed to be from the same Russia-linked hackers behind the SolarWinds hack. In a &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Tom Burt, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for customer security and trust, said the attack appears to be targeting government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and NGOs. In total, around 3,000 email accounts are believed to have been targeted across 150 organizations. Victims are spread across upward of 24 countries, but the majority are believed to be in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfRZJc"&gt;According to Microsoft, hackers from a threat actor called Nobelium were able to compromise the US Agency for International Development’s account on a marketing service called Constant Contact, allowing them to send authentic-looking phishing emails.  &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F05%2F27%2Fnew-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s post&lt;/a&gt; contains a screenshot of one of these emails, which claimed to contain a link to “documents on election fraud” from Donald Trump. However, when clicked, this link would install a backdoor that let the attackers steal data or infect other computers on the same network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wJ7vhs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Phishing emails were sent from the US Agency for International Development&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KFVnKm"&gt;“We are aware that the account credentials of one of our customers were compromised and used by a malicious actor to access the customer’s Constant Contact accounts,” a spokesperson for Constant Contact said in a statement. “This is an isolated incident, and we have temporarily disabled the impacted accounts while we work in cooperation with our customer, who is working with law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uH92dK"&gt;Microsoft says it believes that many of the attacks were blocked automatically, and that its Windows Defender antivirus software is also limiting the spread of the malware. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/05/27/microsoft-announces-new-campaign-nobelium"&gt;has acknowledged Microsoft’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; and encouraged administrators to apply the “necessary mitigations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrH23F"&gt;This salvo of malicious emails is a warning that supply chain cyberattacks against US organizations are showing no signs of slowing, and that hackers are updating their methods in response to previous attacks becoming public. In its post, Microsoft calls for new international norms to be established governing “nation-state conduct in cyberspace” along with expectations of the consequences for breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OoTCh"&gt;The US government has blamed SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service, for the SolarWinds hack, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/russian-hackers-resume-u-s-cyber-offensive-microsoft-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, although Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has denied Russian involvement. The attack is believed to have compromised around 100 private sector companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;and nine federal agencies&lt;/a&gt;. Up to 18,000 SolarWinds customers are believed to have been exposed to the malicious code. In response, President Biden announced new sanctions on Russia and moved to expel 10 Russian diplomats from Washington, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AkMGO1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hard lessons of the SolarWinds hack","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248631/solarwinds-hack-cybersecurity-us-menn-decoder-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iMfACM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New AirPods Pro could launch in 2022 with a focus on fitness tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKzjXr_CyP-rN9bA4oYiY2DE1X0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69355728/akrales_191030_3763_0471.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Utbha7"&gt;Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro will launch next year, following the release of an updated pair of standard AirPods this year, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new AirPods Pro will reportedly feature upgraded motion sensors to allow for fitness tracking, while the entry-level AirPods will have an updated design similar to the Pro models along with a shorter stem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8Kark"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;previous report from last year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; said that the upcoming AirPods Pro could ditch the stem entirely in favor of a more compact design similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt;. However, at the time &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; noted that design challenges meant these plans could change. Its latest report says Apple has “tested” this design, which sounds like it’s not guaranteed to appear in the final model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zETRX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Following the launch of the AirPods Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaxHpL"&gt;Alongside the two new AirPods models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379470/apple-tv-homepod-speaker-camera-video-call-soundbar-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;Apple is reported to be developing&lt;/a&gt; a HomePod equipped with a screen, as well as a separate Apple TV-like device that could include a speaker and camera for video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQ6nt6"&gt;The new AirPods would be the first updates to Apple’s true wireless lineup in over a year. Apple first release its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;, while its entry-level AirPods haven’t been updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;since March 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It released its first AirPods-branded over-ear headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;, in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new 13-inch Android tablet also works as a portable Switch display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_9rbb_M3Rgya8cYVfhz8CXT3V0=/0x115:1371x1029/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69355124/XEbQB42rd4G9SboycZMTV63zq_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A built in Micro HDMI port lets the tablet work as an external monitor. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8DMtP"&gt;Lenovo’s &lt;a href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1014615.html"&gt;Yoga Pad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a new 13-inch Android tablet that can easily double as an external monitor, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/05/25/the-lenovo-yoga-pad-pro-is-a-premium-android-tablet-that-doubles-as-an-external-display/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available to buy in China for 3,299 yuan (around $517) on May 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqPjgn"&gt;It’s not tricky to get most tablets on the market to work as a second monitor, but for the most part you’re limited to using them with specific devices. Apple’s iPads can be used as external monitors thanks to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651017/apple-ipad-pro-pencil-sidecar-wwdc-2019"&gt;built-in Sidecar feature&lt;/a&gt;, for example, but this only works if you’re using them with a Mac. But the Yoga Pad Pro has a full-on Micro HDMI port built into its grip, meaning you can plug basically &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;HDMI device into it and use the Yoga Pad Pro as a 13-inch monitor. And yes, that &lt;a href="https://p2.lefile.cn/product/adminweb/2021/05/24/XEbQB42rd4G9SboycZMTV63zq-0247.jpg"&gt;absolutely includes a Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/46HStEeiyAQuX-tpeeG-3xmMDes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545433/nBd8LhbQy1rkBaPk4uO09V0UR_3489.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga Pad Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sSAldxeYO8KMjuzxr9QG_q7iARU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545438/87gJ7enWYO6TAJ4rshZ3EXNBD_5607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its built-in stand doubles as a hanger for when your wine glasses want to use it to watch TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lLpG05"&gt;For use as a tablet, the Yoga Pad Pro is powered by a Snapdragon 870 paired with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 10,200mAh battery. It’s got four Dolby Atmos-compatible speakers arranged around its 2K, 16:10 LCD display, and it also includes a kickstand that can rotate a full 180-degrees out from behind the back of the device. Why would you want a 180-degree kickstand on a tablet? For &lt;a href="https://p1.lefile.cn/product/adminweb/2021/05/24/87gJ7enWYO6TAJ4rshZ3EXNBD-5607.jpg"&gt;hanging it on a wall&lt;/a&gt;, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpKaF5"&gt;Sure, there are plenty of other portable monitors out there, often available with bigger screen sizes and lower price tags. Take Lenovo’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238314/lenovo-thinkvision-m14-portable-usb-c-monitor-mwc-2019"&gt;14-inch ThinkVision M14&lt;/a&gt; as an example, which is half the price at $249. But the Yoga Pad Pro has the advantage of being a capable standalone device in its own right, complete with stylus compatibility and an 8-megapixel selfie camera (though there’s no rear camera). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsieOA"&gt;It’s unclear if the Yoga Pad Pro will ever see a release outside of China. But if it does, we’ll be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony launches motion-sensing music effects controller on Indiegogo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4Q4RQf3dfzr5kkkey1REqJNp3Y=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69354968/houa3hlugbgte6bjgidn.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LpMtXQ"&gt;Here’s something you don’t see every day: a brand-new Sony product launching first on Indiegogo. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fmotion-sonic%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458023%2Fsony-motion-sonic-launches-music-indiegogo-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Motion Sonic&lt;/a&gt; is, in the words of Sony’s campaign, “effects gear to control sound in sync with your motion for playing music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c57KEz"&gt;The Motion Sonic device itself is a small capsule that can slot into differently shaped rubber wristbands, sort of like a Fitbit. There’s a band that attaches to your wrist for use cases like playing guitar, and another wraps around the back of your hand and is better suited to playing keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOtdYd"&gt;What it actually does is allow you to link hand motions to specific musical effects. For example, you could set it to add a delay effect when you move fingers from left to right, or to bend pitch as you roll your wrist. These effects are all created and saved on an iOS app, then you need to connect your iPhone to your instrument with an audio interface. (It’s not compatible with Android.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxP8hf"&gt;Here are some demonstrations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tu4QYI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTazUqnJhzM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MsULYW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9fUo41DWiU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWGINH"&gt;Sony has actually had this project kicking around for quite a while — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/13/14914172/sony-motion-sonic-wristband-wearable-dance-music-sxsw-2017"&gt;we tried out an early version&lt;/a&gt; at SXSW in 2017. Shortly after, Sony posted &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/design/stories/motionsonic/"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with a designer and art director on the project, who attributed the initial idea to an engineer called Heesoon Kim. The Motion Sonic Indiegogo campaign now lists Kim as project lead, quoting him as saying “I believe we can create new entertainment never seen before with Motion Sonic and I’m so excited to create a new culture with you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRcqtC"&gt;Sony isn’t new to crowdfunding, but most of its projects to date — like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333837/sony-reon-pocket-hands-on-wearable-air-conditioner-japan"&gt;the Reon Pocket wearable air conditioner&lt;/a&gt; — have been limited to its own First Flight site in Japan. Now that Motion Sonic is on Indiegogo, Sony will ship it to the US as well as its home market. The first 400 units will sell for 23,900 yen or $218, and the retail price is 27,200 yen or $248. The product is scheduled to ship in March next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO’s The Last of Us is the rare show letting a video game actor reprise her role</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="61st Annual GRAMMY Awards - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mwkdQtcKbDdC1jdBngFwH2Gq2RQ=/0x0:3350x2233/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69354620/1097256280.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amy Sussman/FilmMagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anlmcp"&gt;Merle Dandridge, an actor who’s had a long career in television and theater, will be reprising her role of Marlene in HBO’s &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; adaptation, according to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-last-of-us-merle-dandridge-marlene-hbo-1234983605/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/the-last-of-us-merle-dandridge-repris-original-game-hbo-series-1234765808/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Dandridge’s casting is particularly notable because actors in video games are rarely presented with the opportunity to play their characters in live action outside of the motion capture stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIhhyd"&gt;Marlene is integral to how lead characters Joel and Ellie join together and head off on their zombie road trip in the first place. It’s unknown how much of the game’s story will carry over to the television adaptation, but Dandridge’s situation is unique. Both Troy Baker’s Joel and Ashley Johnson’s Ellie were recast for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21583442/hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show-playstation-neil-druckmann-craig-mazin-series-order"&gt;executive producer and writer Craig Mazin’s take&lt;/a&gt; on the critically acclaimed video game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;Pedro Pascal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;Bella Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; were announced to be filling both roles, respectively, in February.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yPbruB"&gt;Just look at the recent history of adapting video games for film and TV and you can see the trend. Any time a game is brought to the big screen, a Hollywood actor seems to be slotted into the lead role. It happened with casting Jake Gyllenhal in &lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia,&lt;/em&gt; Tom Holland in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/22/15676770/uncharted-movie-tom-holland-nathan-drake-spider-man"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Alicia Vikander in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/28/11531858/alicia-vikander-tomb-raider-reboot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But for the reverse, the only recent example I could find was Jen Taylor joining the cast of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514578/halo-tv-series-showtime-microsoft-xbox"&gt;ViacomCBS’ &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor’s played Cortana since 2001 in the games, but Natascha McElhone was originally cast as the character in the show. Due to the pandemic interrupting production, McElhone had to step down, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21561137/halo-tv-show-cortana-recast-jen-taylor"&gt;Taylor was brought back in&lt;/a&gt; to play the character she helped create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJDYNB"&gt;Besides her talent, Dandridge’s success in securing the part could be credited to the increasingly common use of motion capture in games. If there’s an actor who’s physically played a video game character in cut scenes and voiced them in every other scenario, they might as well be considered for a live-action take on the material — they’ve clearly done the work. For now Dandridge and Taylor are outliers, but with more video game adaptions on the way, it could be the start of a positive trend for actors who might normally be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spyra has a new digital water blaster that looks like it’ll blow the original away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JMayGkdjSnD9iKsb0al3ElB3UY0=/0x0:1658x1105/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69353890/spira_two.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3n38OY"&gt;In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/10/17674496/spyra-one-water-gun-digital-ammo-counter-usb-c-kickstarter"&gt;we marveled over the Spyra One&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to crowdfund a modern Super Soaker that could blast veritable &lt;em&gt;bolts&lt;/em&gt; of water; refill&lt;em&gt; itself&lt;/em&gt; from a pool; and maintain a digital ammo gauge of your shots, thanks to a heap of electronics, a self-pressurizing tank, and a battery you recharge via a standard USB-C port. The big catch: you had to be willing to risk north of $133 on an unproven Kickstarter that wound up shipping a year behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VcsflI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spyra Two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EEl76C"&gt;But not only did Spyra eventually manage to ship those blasters (11,000 of them, according to the company) it’s now got a new version coming next month that sounds like a huge improvement in practically every way. &lt;a href="https://spyra.com/products/spyratwo"&gt;The new Spyra Two&lt;/a&gt; fires faster, further, has twice the battery life, the company claims the pump is less noisy now — and this time, the company says it’s already manufactured and ready to ship in early June with no crowdfunding whatsoever. The initial units seem to be sold out, but Spyra’s website says it’ll have more in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlU4uK"&gt;The only downside, on paper anyhow, is a lower capacity of 20 shots compared to the 25 of the original... and a $159 pricetag. You can still charge up three distinct shots at a time, each ready to dispense a shot-glass worth of water at your friends, or charge up for a bigger blast that can travel up to 46 feet if you’re aiming at a 45-degree angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vel4t9"&gt;Here’s a quick spec comparison I whipped up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jwg1oF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10522643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ReyldP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Crns5rmGv6w?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=22&amp;amp;start=22" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5cumb"&gt;While the company doesn’t seem to have an official video of the new Spyra Two in action yet, just the brief intro above, you can check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXiYfApXd1o"&gt;this video from YouTuber LordDraconical&lt;/a&gt; for an idea of what the blaster’s capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zdPWM8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXiYfApXd1o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w21nmB"&gt;Drac points out that it’s also got a rubber flap over the USB-C port now, letting you more fully submerge it in a swimming pool. The company’s documentation isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; clear on whether that’s a good idea, though: while &lt;a href="https://spyraeu.reamaze.com/kb/english-faq-9603031bed8ce828/is-the-spyratwo-waterproof"&gt;one FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; states that “All components of the SpyraTwo are individually protected agains[t] water damage” and that the primary risk is simply that it won’t float, &lt;a href="https://spyraeu.reamaze.com/kb/english-faq-9603031bed8ce828/can-i-fully-submerge-the-spyratwo-under-water"&gt;another FAQ&lt;/a&gt; reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="IU5aSb"&gt;The SpyraTwo is like a yoghurt cup, which means your SpyraTwo will fill up with water and join the Titanic. This can also increase the dripping on the barrel. Among other things, this can affect the lifespan of the SpyraTwo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5D3SjE"&gt;Cool. &lt;/p&gt;
