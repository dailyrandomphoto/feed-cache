    <title>Epic pledges $20 million for Fortnite esports in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akcYsY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic says that, for 2021, the game’s competitive scene will have a prize pool of $20 million. That’s a step up from last year’s total of $17 million — though it’s not as massive as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934329/fortnite-world-cup-finals-epic-games-esports-ninja-tfue-bugha-marshmello"&gt;the 2019 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where $30 million was on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1j3tE3"&gt;The news comes as Epic provided details on the latest season of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Champion Series, the game’s highest level of competition. The developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152744/epic-fortnite-world-cup-2021-canceled-fncs"&gt;previously said that all competitions would take place online&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it revealed more details about the schedule: qualifiers will kick off on February 4th, with the finals starting on March 12th. In a nod to the global nature of the game, there will also be three new, separate broadcasts with commentary in French, German, and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rN7fjO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our overall goal is to create better consistency.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdDuDn"&gt;There are a number of other format and scoring changes; you can check &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/2021-and-chapter-2-season-5-fncs-details"&gt;Epic’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; for the full rundown. “Our overall goal is to create better consistency throughout the year and tie the 2021 seasons together for a more cohesive experience,” Epic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Y3sAkk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Fortnite World Cup Finals were a victory lap for Epic Games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934329/fortnite-world-cup-finals-epic-games-esports-ninja-tfue-bugha-marshmello"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d8Kwxc"&gt;As for the prize pool, there will be four seasons of the FNCS in 2021, with a total of $3 million in prize money for each. But Epic says there are additional tournaments on the way. “We also have plans for mid and end of year competitions where we will bring together the top performing FNCS players in each region in multiple competitive formats,” the developer explains. The remaining $8 million will serve as the prize money for these yet-to-be-determined tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF0rQx"&gt;Meanwhile, earlier today, Epic revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;a new partnership&lt;/a&gt; that will see 23 different professional soccer teams featured in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned bats are trendsetters in tracking tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A small bat with its wings spread in flight against a dark background. On its back is a sensor that looks like a little battery pack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQIsjGG_3YwNgYPGQ9CI75ARXWs=/0x1028:2139x2454/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689622/dulog_tag.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Look at this bat’s little backpack! | Image: dulog&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCmX19"&gt;Bats are elusive little creatures, which makes them the perfect subjects for scientists to try out new animal tracking systems. This is great news for me specifically, because I love both bats &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; seeing images of animals with goofy little trackers on them. How can you look at &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seals-high-tech-hats-are-collecting-climate-data-antarctic-180973709/"&gt;these seals with ridiculous antenna hats&lt;/a&gt; and not laugh at least a little?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9Alnc"&gt;One of the latest innovations in tracking wearables is the &lt;a href="https://dulog.net/"&gt;dulog&lt;/a&gt; system, a wireless sensor network built by biologist Simon Ripperger and engineer Niklas Duda, which was put to the test in several bat-tracking studies over the past few years. Now that the dulog has proven its mettle with bats, which are tiny, nocturnal, and generally tough to observe, the pair believe it could be useful in monitoring all kinds of animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXZ5Bg"&gt;“If your project can succeed with bats, it can probably work with most species,” says Ripperger in &lt;a href="https://www.silabs.com/community/blog.entry.html/2021/01/19/iot_heroes_createwirelessnetworktostudybats-yK5y"&gt;a recent Silicon Labs blog post&lt;/a&gt;. When he first got started in the bat-tracking business, he saw that his adviser was “essentially running behind bats, chasing them with an antenna.” I will be holding that image in my mind for a while, but Ripperger and Duda think the dulog’s tiny sensors will make animal studies easier — less chasing required. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bat with reddish fur sits on a tree branch with a small sensor on its back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtZa2ot7_G7_6NiRJNo4wjNVEPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244912/Nyctalus_noctula__adult_Berlin___Kopie.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: dulog&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny common noctule bat wearing the latest in sensor fashion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T0Y5QU"&gt;The data collected with dulog tags can be downloaded remotely, meaning after the initial attachment, scientists don’t have to wrangle animals to retrieve data from their tags. They’re also smaller and lighter than current GPS tracking systems that enable remote downloads — the bat pictured above would fit in the palm of your hand, and the sensor weighs less than a gram. What’s most exciting to Ripperger is that the tags “talk to each other,” meaning they can be used to track the social behavior of tagged animals based on their proximity to each other over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmvMIl"&gt;So far, the dulog system has been used in studies that have produced some delightful findings: &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0884"&gt;mother bats guide their pups&lt;/a&gt; from roost to roost, formerly captive bats maintain their social relationships &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982219313648"&gt;when released in the wild&lt;/a&gt;, and bats exhibit &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/31/6/1296/5937165"&gt;“social distancing” behavior&lt;/a&gt; when they’re sick. After these bat-based successes, Ripperger and Duda hope to soon start selling the system to researchers for use with other animals, both large and small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeZQ8t"&gt;In terms of possible applications for the system, “the sky is the limit,” says Ripperger. I am not involved in any important animal research, but personally I would love to hook a tag to my dog to keep tabs on her general mischief. I imagine they would also be helpful for keeping track of which squirrels are the biggest offenders in eating my bird seed. For now, they’re not available for direct order, so I will leave the science to the scientists and continue to enjoy pictures of animals with backpacks and hats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some M1 Mac users reporting screensaver takeover bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7vtFS1TG21JsZ2cPzfJfdtmqSI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689511/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zx4UVA"&gt;I picked up a new MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 chip, and I’ve absolutely loved it so far. It’s really speedy and the battery is fantastic. But I’ve been dealing with one nagging issue. Every once in a while, for reasons that I haven’t been able to figure out, a screensaver will suddenly take over the entire computer — despite the fact that I never use a screensaver. And frustratingly, the screensaver renders my laptop inoperable until I completely close the screen and reopen it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf8SGP"&gt;It seems I’m not the only one seeing this bug, according to this &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/18/m1-macs-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;. Others have shared similar issues with M1-equipped MacBook Airs, Pros, and Minis on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29296369#post-29296369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-is-going-on-here-screensaver-like-animation-spontaneously-appears-video.2273013/?post=29338930#post-29338930"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, Reddit (in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/k3mmwt/macbook_air_m1_2020_display_issue_screen_show_sup/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/k18gih/has_anyone_ever_seen_this_it_just_recently/"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;), and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252083925?page=1"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;. And one user on &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; said they’ve &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-m1-macs-affected-by-fast-user-switching-screensaver-bug.2280806/?post=29517694#post-29517694"&gt;seen the bug&lt;/a&gt; on their 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has an Intel chip, so perhaps this is a problem with macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd35WL"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/N3CoMocJ7Rw"&gt;a video of the bug&lt;/a&gt;, shared by &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-activates-randomly-m1-air.2270873/?post=29307255#post-29307255"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; forum member dawideksl&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="B36v0c"&gt;Many people reporting the issue in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kj4ova/big_sur_screensaver_bug/"&gt;this Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; say they have multiple accounts on the same computer. And for what it’s worth, I’ve set up two accounts on my MacBook Air. One user on Apple’s &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252087996?answerId=254255624022#254255624022"&gt;support forums&lt;/a&gt; disabled Fast User Switching and said they weren’t seeing the screensaver, so perhaps that’s a workaround until Apple addresses the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9p3vO"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJ350W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brave browser takes step toward enabling a decentralized web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54ASck_s2c9ZOXD4yBZYEA-8ios=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68689158/acastro_200211_3900_Brave_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Pw9FC"&gt;Brave has just taken a step toward supporting a decentralized web by becoming the first browser to offer native integration with a peer-to-peer networking protocol that aims to fundamentally change how the internet works. The technology is called IPFS (which stands for InterPlanetary File System), a relatively obscure transport protocol that promises to improve on the dominant HTTP standard by making content faster to access and more resilient to failure and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUyeek"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/04/why-the-internet-needs-ipfs-before-its-too-late/"&gt;explainer from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offers a good overview of how the protocol works. But here’s the short version: while HTTP is designed for browsers to access information on central servers, IPFS accesses it on a network of distributed nodes. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/78xgaq/the-interplanetary-file-system-wants-to-create-a-permanent-web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; likens&lt;/a&gt; it to downloading content via BitTorrent, rather than from a central server. You type in a web address like normal, and the &lt;a href="https://ipfs.io/#how"&gt;network is able to find the nodes&lt;/a&gt; storing the content you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kbeKCq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“IPFS gives users a solution to the problem of centralized servers creating a central point of failure for content access.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8MSq0C"&gt;Benefits of the new approach include faster speeds because data can be distributed and stored closer to the people who are accessing it, as well as lower server costs for the original publisher of the content. But perhaps most importantly, IPFS has the potential to make web content much more resilient to failures and resistant to censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMJubD"&gt;Brave, which currently boasts 24 million monthly active users, has been an &lt;a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-10-08-ipfs-browsers-update/"&gt;early supporter of IPFS&lt;/a&gt;, working on the standard since 2018. But with &lt;a href="https://brave.com/download/"&gt;version 1.19&lt;/a&gt; of the Brave browser releasing today, Brave users will be able to access IPFS content directly by resolving URIs that start with ipfs://. They can also opt to install a “full IPFS node in one click,” making their browser a node in the peer-to-peer network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9YKDb"&gt;“IPFS gives users a solution to the problem of centralized servers creating a central point of failure for content access,” Brave CTO Brian Bondy said in a statement, adding that this gives Brave users “the power to seamlessly serve content to millions of new users across the globe via a new and secure protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr4NlA"&gt;IPFS project lead Molly Mackinlay adds that IPFS’s enablement of the decentralized web can overcome “systemic data censorship” from governments and Big Tech. “Today, Web users across the world are unable to access restricted content, including, for example, parts of Wikipedia in Thailand, over 100,000 blocked websites in Turkey, and critical access to COVID-19 information in China,” says Mackinlay, “Now anyone with an internet connection can access this critical information through IPFS on the Brave browser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGhVVz"&gt;This effort to make web content more resilient and unconstrained comes at a time when service and platform owners are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225238/trump-social-media-ban-platform-moderation-tech-regulation-daphne-keller-interview"&gt;facing tough choices&lt;/a&gt; about what content should remain online. Following the Capitol riot on January 6th, President Trump was silenced on both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the Parler app being pulled from both the Google and Apple app stores and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon withdrawing its centralized web services&lt;/a&gt;. A decentralized web enabled, in part, by IPFS would make that kind of control more difficult in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFr0TF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-186" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;

Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631S3BP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ec9f3ab0f5e7827303dfa0d2a8efa4c7&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model with Wi-Fi in Silver marked down to $759.05&lt;/a&gt; (with a coupon applied) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5de51a395ed06fc6671cc2868597f47a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration in both colors for $849&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f9ea03b10d85b158021643fd4d952af6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,230&lt;/a&gt;; that’s $69 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All five seasons of The Muppet Show are heading to Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9TILAUfUncmPLVWlNQnHb7q6Wo=/0x81:1200x881/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68688972/TMS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GeVGEd"&gt;All five seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt; will stream on Disney Plus beginning February 19th, Disney announced today. With the addition, Disney Plus is now home to nearly every Muppets title — except two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wZ2gl"&gt;While Disney owns the rights to &lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Muppets Most Wanted&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Muppet Movie&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Muppet Treasure Island&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Muppet Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Muppets&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Great Muppet Caper&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;all of which are streaming on Disney Plus, &lt;em&gt;The Muppets Take Manhattan &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Muppets from Space &lt;/em&gt;are owned by Sony. As such, Disney can’t host the entire Muppet movie collection. Disney will also make the fourth and fifth seasons of the series, previously never available to purchase through home video offerings, available on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1mgut"&gt;It’s a similar situation to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892494/spider-man-homecoming-review-tom-holland-michael-keaton-robert-downey-jr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761022/spider-man-far-from-home-review-tom-holland-jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-mcu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that Marvel Studios (and therefore Disney) co-produced the film with Sony, Sony owns the rights to the series. That’s why the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe collection isn’t available on Disney Plus. Licensing rights! The bane of every subscriber’s existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPXvPG"&gt;Fans of Jim Henson Company’s entire body of work are in even more of a pickle. While most of the Muppets works are on Disney Plus, the entirety of &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271931/fraggle-rock-apple-tv-plus-new-series-licensed-strategy"&gt;belongs to Apple&lt;/a&gt;. When the tech giant decided to reboot &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt;, the company purchased the streaming rights to the entire series in order to have the full collection. That means anyone who wants to stream all of &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock &lt;/em&gt;or every single Muppets title needs to do it in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li id="cXil32"&gt;Purchase &lt;em&gt;Muppets from Space &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Muppets Take Manhattan &lt;/em&gt;through iTunes, Vudu, Amazon, or some other digital retailer. They’re currently $3 each on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Muppets-Space-Bill-Baretta/dp/B000W4CG60/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HyzeuN"&gt;This type of fracturing was always where subscribers, based in the United States especially, were headed. As more conglomerates launch streaming services to try to earn recurring revenue, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197141/netflix-leaving-2020-spiderverse-west-wing-dexter-wreck-it-ralph-office-disney-plus-hbo-max"&gt;more exclusivity plays&lt;/a&gt;. More exclusivity plays means there are likely more streamers to sign up for to watch every single movie or TV show in a franchise until all the licensing rights are bought back. Hopefully, eventually, Disney Plus will be home to every single Muppets title — the question is whether Disney wants to strike that licensing negotiation with Sony, and when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsNA79"&gt;If being able to watch any Muppets movie or TV show whenever possible means more to you than pulling up a site like JustWatch to see where something is streaming, just purchase them all. It’s a streaming-first world, but nothing beats ownership. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirPods Max teardown makes Sony and Bose headphones look ‘like toys’</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit praises Apple’s use of screws to attach key components.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T2hskn"&gt;iFixit’s &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/17/ifixit-shares-airpods-max-teardown-says-apples-headphones-are-hard-to-take-apart/"&gt;long in the making&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2BMax%2BTeardown%2F139369%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max teardown&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iFixit/status/1351530005931679744"&gt;finally complete&lt;/a&gt;, giving an exhaustive look at the internals of Apple’s debut over-ear headphones and an idea of how easy they are to repair. iFixit even went as far as to teardown Sony’s WH-1000XM4 and Bose’s NC 700 headphones for comparison. Until now, iFixit has refused to grant Apple a single repairability point for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2BTeardown%2F75578&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2B2%2BTeardown%2F121471&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FAirPods%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F127551&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238632%2Fifixit-airpod-max-teardown-repair-screws-adhesive-sony-bose-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, but the AirPods Max buck the trend with a surprisingly high score of six out of ten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXEbce"&gt;Why so high? Well, for starters, its ear cushions attach via magnets, making them easy to swap and replace when they inevitably get worn out. There are also plenty of internal components held together with screws rather than messy glue, which should make it easy for would-be repairers to swap them out if they break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJfupr_Kqz1CUx4cMyf-Kn7oTws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244909/wwsS5TQfh1EJnSoo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of what iFixit calls “perhaps the most elaborate part” of the headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rf6voIcfj3D0LX5RggbzqctNvq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244913/3TVFPEtOAWpAnyId.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, there’s some adhesive in the way of repairs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9gBwei"&gt;iFixit is particularly fond of the headband hinge mechanism found between the band and the ear cups, which it notes can be detached “with just a SIM card removal tool or paperclip, without even opening the ear cup.” It calls this “perhaps the most elaborate part of the AirPods Max” and notes that it’s “both intricate and overbuilt, and might make the AirPods Max’s price tag a little easier to swallow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyiar3"&gt;The design is also pretty neat: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KcMd5e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty cool &lt;a href="https://t.co/C0cfQyZ72k"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C0cfQyZ72k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—        (@takwan_t) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/takwan_t/status/1351579099714752512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwmtic"&gt;The headphones aren’t perfectly repairable by any means. Opening the AirPods Max involves dealing with some messy adhesive, and while Apple has done a good job at using screws to hold together their internal components, iFixit points out that it uses a bewilderingly different array for the job, meaning you’ll have to be well equipped with screwdriver heads to attempt a repair. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/759wZH7hKv9rqBk7UBOM5V9hpJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22244999/JL5Aa6mhL1UGa5pS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max (center) versus headphones from Sony (left) and Bose (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bTXJkS"&gt;Compared to other popular over-ear headphones, however, the AirPods Max fair well. As part of its deep dive into Apple’s headphones, iFixit also tore down the cheaper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose NC 700&lt;/a&gt;, which are among our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;favorite noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. But it notes that compared to the “obsessive craftsmanship” of Apple’s headphones, they end up looking “like toys by comparison.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG1Kk1"&gt;Considering their eye-watering $550 price tag, it’s reassuring to see that the AirPods Max won’t be a complete nightmare to repair when their batteries and other components start failing in a couple of year’s time. Now, Apple just needs to find a way to bring this same repairability to its &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/true-wireless-hearables-market-beats-expectations-2019-apple-continue-dominating-2020/"&gt;ludicrously popular&lt;/a&gt; true wireless AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtLI59"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 1:44 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added embedded image and video close-ups of the Lightning-esque headband connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian announces another major funding haul</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1I_sqTEgsiEUu7KJPMiBv6UsIg=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68688743/K._Rivian_R1T_Fun_In_Dirt_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yYePFL"&gt;Amazon-backed electric vehicle startup Rivian has raised another $2.65 billion, bolstering its position as one of the most well-funded EV startups in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pS0Ar"&gt;The investment round was led by T. Rowe Price and included Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Fidelity Management and Research Company, and investment firms Coatue and D1 Capital Partners, along with “several other existing and new investors,” according to the startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z6esn"&gt;The new money arrives a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319899/rivian-2-5-billion-funding-round-amazon-soros-r1t-r1s-truck-suv-ford"&gt;mere six months after Rivian raised $2.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and about a year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035192/rivian-funding-1-3-billion-t-rowe-price-amazon-ford"&gt;it raised $1.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. It has now raised more than $8 billion to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a43i3X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian has raised some $8 billion to date&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XAFOj"&gt;It’s hard to say exactly how much Rivian has in the bank, given that it has spent a lot already to hire a massive team while also developing at least three vehicles that we know of. But after this new funding round, the EV startup’s war chest likely rivals that of China’s Nio, which also has billions of dollars in the bank following a number of recent raises. (A direct comparison here is tough, though, since some Chinese startups like Nio have received government support.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG99gr"&gt;That money will be crucial as Rivian gets ready to release its first two electric vehicles later this year, the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV. Rivian is also working with Amazon on developing and deploying an electric delivery van, which &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/12/rivians-amazon-van-starts-deliveries-in-la-complete-with-terrible-noisemaker/"&gt;recently was spotted in the wild&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKBgbo"&gt;Whats notable about Rivian’s ability to keep raising such enormous sums of money is that the startup is doing it while keeping the company private. There has been an incredible rush of new funding into the electric vehicle space over the last year, inspired in large part thanks to Tesla. But much of it has come through so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC (special purpose acquisition) mergers&lt;/a&gt;, where publicly-traded but mostly dormant investment funds have absorbed companies like Canoo and Fisker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jANJug"&gt;Rivian is also backed by BlackRock, Soros Fund Management LLC, and Ford, though the Detroit automaker has not been named in the previous two funding rounds. Rivian is working on an electric vehicle with Ford’s luxury marque, Lincoln, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240212/ford-lincoln-cancel-rivian-suv-ev-coronavirus-pandemic-investment"&gt;an SUV collaboration was already shelved last year&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Nmkad"&gt;Ford didn’t participate in this new round of funding, though. “We maintain a significant strategic interest, an important ownership stake and board representation in Rivian,” the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOGqwh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 19th, 1:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Ford. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUqV7g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The M1-powered MacBook Pro is $80 off at Amazon and B&amp;H Photo</title>

  &lt;p id="F4Bo1e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Pro with the new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best-performing laptops on the market for the cost, and that cost is a little less than usual today. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LLDSG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604811-REG%2Fapple_myda2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22238493%2Fapple-macbook-pro-m1-paper-mario-cyberpunk-2077-tidal-deal-sale-best-buy-amazon#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; have each knocked $80 from the base model’s normal $1,299 price. At checkout, you’ll pay $1,219, which is just $20 more than the lowest price yet. In other words, if you’ve been waiting for a deal, today’s not a bad day to go for it. Though, this price is only set for the silver-colored option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSRqYa"&gt;Unlike the M1-equipped MacBook Air, this base model Pro features a fan, as well as an eight-core GPU instead of seven in the Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Hn2nN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9715950"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QNA34f"&gt;Looking to change your music streaming service or jump onto one for the first time? Tidal’s HiFi service delivers high-bitrate audio and support for formats like Sony’s 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos Music. Whether you intend to fully take advantage of this service’s audiophile-friendly features or just want to join something that’s cheap, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729870345818015929" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has a one-year HiFi subscription for just $50&lt;/a&gt; (normally $120 per year). Note that it’s auto-renewing, so you’ll need to manually tick it not to renew if you don’t want that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mcWucw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10291535"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V4Fgkd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario: The Origami King&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch hasn’t seen many (or really, any) discounts since it launched in 2020. A $15 discount isn’t much, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729870905099910986" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that’s the sale currently running at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which brings the physical version of the game down to $45. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324614/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;My colleague Andrew Webster’s review&lt;/a&gt; praised its hilarious writing and clever RPG gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3A2QpG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10291553"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xGikt4"&gt;In case you missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/1/18/22237692/cyberpunk-2077-sale-half-off-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x"&gt;Sean Hollister’s post yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, you can still nab yourself a copy of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on the PS4 and Xbox One (both versions are compatible on next-gen consoles) for far less than the regular $60 price. It’s no longer $30, but its current $35 price is still a nice deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zeief2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Instagram lead says he’s not happy with Reels yet and might ‘consolidate’ video formats</title>

  &lt;p id="8SRWh1"&gt;Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, isn’t thrilled with the platform’s TikTok competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels&lt;/a&gt;. He discussed the format, which launched in the US in August, during an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder &lt;/em&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk9dYf"&gt;“I’m not yet happy with it,” he says. “We’re growing both in terms of how much people are sharing and how much people are consuming, but we have a long way to go. And we have to be honest that TikTok is ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69LR1a"&gt;He went on to say the team is mostly focused on “table stakes” right now, and not honed in on how to differentiate itself. Specifically, he calls out TikTok’s innovative creative tools, like filters and effects that spur new video meme formats as something Instagram isn’t making on its own yet but needs to eventually do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbiLmu"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP1720097944" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RbJLAi"&gt;“I think we have to get better at building more powerful and creative tools that aren’t necessarily a meme or a sort of moment in a package, but give people who are more creative than us and make content for a living the ability to make something that’s going to pop,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RCwtC"&gt;Instagram is also seeing a conflict between its many different video formats. Mosseri says “most people” likely don’t know the difference between videos posted to Instagram and IGTV, the app’s format for longer videos that’s existed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484436/instagram-igtv-video-app-launch"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TUFpqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The head of Instagram on where social media goes from here","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vepdWe"&gt;“That’s probably too nuanced a distinction to resonate with anybody, so we’re looking about how we can — not just with IGTV, but across all of Instagram — simplify and consolidate ideas, because last year we placed a lot of new bets,” he says. “I think this year we have to go back to our focus on simplicity and craft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAYX6g"&gt;This is a wildly different tone than when Instagram launched the format and called it the “&lt;a href="https://business.instagram.com/a/IGTV"&gt;future of video&lt;/a&gt;.” But it speaks to the rapid success of TikTok which, in 2018, wasn’t fully known in mainstream culture but is now a driver of conversation, memes, and viral dances. Mosseri hints that IGTV and Reels, as well as general videos posted to the Instagram grid, need some sort of consolidation and clarity, which makes sense, especially when the app is trying to do everything all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
