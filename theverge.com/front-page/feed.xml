    <title>The 2021 iPad Pro has dropped to its lowest price yet</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e8wy1U"&gt;If you can’t wait to get your hands on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, check out this great iPad Pro deal, which will certainly keep you distracted in the meantime. Today &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932CJZ22/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon, you can save $200&lt;/a&gt; on this upgraded 12.9-inch model that has 256GB of storage. Typically $1,199, the retailer is offering the Wi-Fi-only version in space gray for $999 instead, which is an appealing price since it’s the current cost of the 128GB version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWJfvT"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised the iPad Pro’s beautiful Mini LED screen, the fast M1 processor, and the Center Stage camera, which follows faces while you make video calls. The iPad also offers good dual rear cameras that are paired with lidar, excellent microphones, support for the second-gen Apple Pencil, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZdRwfE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOpvli"&gt;Android phone owners feeling left out while the tech world goes nuts over the latest AirPods 3, fear not: we’ve got something for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gC5zXR"&gt;Samsung’s entry-level wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight/dp/B0942DM32W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; are the company’s smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds yet. Typically $150, right now Amazon is selling them for $130, the lowest price it’s offered on the well-reviewed earbuds yet. The discount applies to all styles, ranging from white and graphite to olive green. You can also add a Galaxy SmartTag, paying $155 in total instead of the $180 that it usually costs to buy both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUZRFZ"&gt;We loved that it offers features like active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a small, low-profile design with good audio quality and performance. It’s so good and affordable that, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we predicted it would become the default pick for many Android users — especially when the sales start to hit, which it seems they are. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vXnixU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQ08n2"&gt;Razer’s Basilisk V2 wired gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;one of the best mice you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s already a good deal in and of itself, offering many of the features that comes with the more expensive Basilisk Ultimate, Razer’s wireless version, but for an affordable price. Today, however, it’s a better deal given you can get it for over half off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irxDLw"&gt;Typically $80, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082G5BDNC/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfPnd39G8ta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the mouse for $35 instead. For a nearly 60 percent discount, you can buy a mouse that offers a scroll wheel with adjustable tension, tactile buttons, a thin SpeedFlex cable, customizable LEDs, and fast performance. What’s more, Best Buy is also throwing in $10 off a three-month digital subscription to Xbox Game Pass for PC when you buy it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8e5U1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bxVsxx"&gt;You can currently grab a pair of the Jabra Elite 75t earbuds for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Jabra has since released an updated version of these earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Jabra Elite 3&lt;/a&gt;, but we still consider the 75t to be a decent alternative to the AirPods, thanks to their solid sound quality and comfortable design. These earbuds come in black or gray and can last a little over five hours on a single charge. The on-ear mics can be used for calls, as well as for summoning Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant — and you can connect them to two devices at once, an unusual feature for this price. The matte-finished case can hold an extra 18 hours of juice and can be topped off via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HYXLcL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5SPZ8U"&gt;Another fine deal is on a curved gaming monitor, this time for the lowest price ever. You can currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO4JTzLnAq#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $150 on the Samsung CRG5 curved gaming monitor at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $399.99, it costs $249.99. The CRG5 has a 27-inch 1080p panel with a 240Hz refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, both of which should provide stellar performance in the gaming space that's tough to match at this price. The monitor has HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, but it lacks support for peripheral USB connectivity. Another small pain point is the stand, which has limited adjustment options. Though the CRG5 does have a built-in 75 x 75 VESA mount if you need to make the panel more suitable for your desk setup.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P0C0fE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10816293"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5wi7Os"&gt;Dell’s Alienware lineup may have greater curb appeal, but the Dell G15 brings similar performance, just without the extraterrestrial aesthetic. Right now, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO4Uf74Sb2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $270 on this excellent gaming laptop at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $880 instead of its usual $1,150 price. This 15-inch laptop manages to pack in a Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti, and a 512GB SSD. These specs should provide excellent performance for the 1080p high-refresh panel on the G15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SQrNyL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10816306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ieW5Na"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Best Gaming Laptop in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cnKbBq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is turning 10, and you’re invited to the party taking place in New York City on the 22nd and 23rd of October (that’s this weekend!). On The Verge is going to be a celebration of everything we’ve accomplished over the past decade, and we want you to be a part of it. Right now you can &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/evite" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;snag tickets for just $99 with the &lt;strong&gt;promo code $99NOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which gets you admission for both days and four complimentary drink tickets. The event will include speakers from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and from the wider world of tech, as well as musical performances and interactive experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky’s newest expedition adventure features lots of worms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/To8gI2EdAXTqBU7TdK1Ln2XsAcg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020006/No_Man_s_Sky_Emergence_Expedition_Screen_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jC5Er"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is getting its fourth seasonal update with a new expedition called &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt;. Just in time for spooky season (and, coincidentally, the theatrical release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587655/dune-new-trailer-hbo-max-warner-bros-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt; focuses on discovering, taming, and battling giant sandworms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Umfd7r"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Yrn2qEAGDM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8ldX1c"&gt;The trailer for &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt; features some of the wormy updates coming to &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;. Existing sandworms will come in more varieties, players can obtain a grotesque Sarlacc pit-looking helmet, and, perhaps most importantly, players will be able to tame and ride giant &lt;em&gt;flying&lt;/em&gt; sandworms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFUkIR"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22358926/no-mans-sky-expeditions-update-hello-games"&gt;expeditions launched in March&lt;/a&gt; of this year, Hello Games says &lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt; is the first one to feature a dedicated narrative. Starting on the sand-blighted planet of Wasan, explorers will unravel the mysteries of an ancient cult as they unlock milestones, complete expedition phases, and hunt the dreaded titan worms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cwwBh"&gt;Expeditions began as a way of introducing timed, seasonal content to &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;. There have been three expeditions this year, with each &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22446499/no-mans-sky-mass-effect-normandy-starship"&gt;offering exclusive rewards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450919/hello-games-no-mans-sky-next-game-sean-murray-interview"&gt;undergone a radical transformation&lt;/a&gt; since its launch five years ago. Players can experience the space exploration game on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537078/no-mans-sky-next-generation-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-announcement"&gt;next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18285578/no-mans-sky-vr-preview-sean-murray-interview"&gt;and in VR&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjVxjZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JmvKe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpDUs7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil 4 in VR shouldn’t work — but somehow it does</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 4 VR - El Gigante fight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fufXH2gF1v9RNBLEE14w4DOr8OI=/314x0:2474x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70019560/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_ELGIGANTE_TMP_007_2560X1440_LEGAL.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ykKZdo"&gt;I didn’t have stellar hopes going into &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s virtual reality adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XV2OI2"&gt;VR versions of non-VR games are often at best superfluous and at worst painful — sometimes literally if you’re prone to motion sickness. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; supported VR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14369624/resident-evil-7-ps4-playstation-vr"&gt;to questionable effect&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. And &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; in VR, an Oculus Quest 2 version of Capcom’s 2005 GameCube game, makes a lot of tradeoffs that sound compromising on paper. But the weirdest part by far? It mostly works. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s VR version retools a horror classic with VR combat satisfying enough to make up for its myriad rough edges, producing something surprisingly fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bW7kFJ"&gt;Unlike Capcom’s recent &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;3 &lt;/em&gt;console remakes, which were heavily reimagined versions of their source material, &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; (technically simply named &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;) is a nearly beat-for-beat copy of the original’s narrative, enemy encounters, and level layout. It’s got crisper textures and spatial audio upgrades, but if you’ve seen the game’s high-definition rerelease or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309983/resident-evil-4-hd-project-remake-remaster-mod-pc-textures-graphics"&gt;even more HD fan-made remaster&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not an extraordinary graphical overhaul. Instead, port developer Armature Studio has focused on translating a third-person console shooter into a first-person headset-based game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A2bWaL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTIizcuSdHg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCyiCJ"&gt;More accurately, Armature is translating &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the game. The bulk of &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;’s gameplay turns your over-the-shoulder view of protagonist Leon Kennedy into a first-person experience with a pair of disembodied hands — wearing Leon’s trademark fingerless gloves, of course. The game’s heads-up display is a wristwatch with details like your health and ammo count, and the inventory menu is lightly revamped with a more 3D look. If you’ve played a single-player VR shooter like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Arizona Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you’ll probably find this mode familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aafxLf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Resident Evil 4’s design puts the most promising elements into VR and cordons off the rest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqD8wt"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t been totally VR-ified. During cutscenes, the game throws you — virtual hands and all — into a black void to watch the action on a flat screen. (You know those dreams where you’re watching a person from the outside, but you also &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; that person? It’s sort of like that.) Many of these scenes originally had quicktime events that involved pressing buttons, and in &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; you’ll see a flat overlay telling you to shake your controllers or pull the triggers at those moments. Outside of cutscenes, kicking an enemy or pushing an object will also briefly shift your viewpoint to a third-person camera so you can see what Leon is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXW4rH"&gt;The clunky mix of formats feels almost retro, but I think it’s the right choice. Armature effectively cordons off the parts of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; that would be least compelling as first-person motion-controlled experiences, then puts its efforts toward building a VR shooting experience that’s smoother than many native VR shooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8c8r5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;’s combat is tactile and satisfying without being punishingly difficult or complicated. It uses the original’s familiar outlay of handguns, long guns, and a knife for close-range fighting. But in addition to selecting them from your inventory, you can map individual weapons onto different parts of your body, grabbing a chosen rifle or shotgun by reaching behind your back or a pistol by reaching to your side. You can also dual-wield weapons — which usually isn’t productive but enables specific scenarios like shooting your pistol at a zombie on your left while knifing one off a ladder to your right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xTPDJ"&gt;The system is natural and makes swapping between weapons — and assembling the right loadout — an integral part of fights. Physically slashing at boxes or zombies feels exactly right. The game ramps up tension by making you grab ammunition and feed it into guns, lending more interactivity to &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s delightful &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2XEyUJL5u4"&gt;reloading animations&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;’s original levels are compact and don’t come off as designed for traversing at inhuman speeds, a common hazard for VR versions of non-VR games. &lt;em&gt;RE4VR &lt;/em&gt;lets you pick between teleporting around and using an analog stick for free motion, but I much preferred the former — which more closely mimics the original’s cadence of running, stopping, and shooting zombies while stationary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Del Lago boss fight from Resident Evil 4 in VR" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9bB1AmJFzqdNc1amWlyNugA9uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939926/RE4_SCREENSHOTS_DELLAGO_001_Legal.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6PkEo7"&gt;Armature’s careful design and the game’s source material set &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; apart from the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7 &lt;/em&gt;VR mode. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; was already at the more action-oriented end of the franchise, and &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; adapts it to fit an established VR shooter formula instead of going for a grueling survival horror experience, which makes the game’s dozen-plus hours a lot less stressful. (I played the game’s HD version on PlayStation 4 a few months before this review, and I’m pretty sure this iteration is also far more generous with item and money drops.) It’s based on a substantially older game that the Oculus Quest 2 seems totally capable of rendering, while the PlayStation VR’s low resolution and muddy screen hamstrung &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;’s VR mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cICep"&gt;Most importantly, &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; is promising a genuinely different experience — not just a VR retread of the same systems. It’s not a replacement for the flatscreen original, and if you’re &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; a purist, the developers have removed a few (honestly cringeworthy and missable) lines from the cutscenes. If anything, it’s the kind of thing that’s great to play after you’ve worked through the game’s puzzles and boss strategies outside VR, so you can focus on the new elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rupSPl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an effective VR shooter, if not a revolutionary one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMVMKi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t revolutionize VR shooters the way &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; transformed console games. There’s nothing as distinctive as &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;’s gravity gloves, &lt;em&gt;Phantom: Covert Ops&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;kayak combat, or the obsessive gunophilia of &lt;em&gt;Hot Dogs, Horseshoes &amp;amp; Hand Grenades&lt;/em&gt;. Features like firearm reloading, which can confer a sense of mastery in games like &lt;em&gt;Alyx&lt;/em&gt;, are more like additional flavor than complex mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQx3iE"&gt;There are a few minor but legitimate misfires. A couple of the game’s already frustrating scripted sections, including its very last scene, become even less fun with motion controls that aren’t quite as intuitive as you’d hope. Miming the use of two-handed guns is a little bit awkward. In a more literal example, you can accidentally pull grenade pins while trying to put the grenades in your inventory, a fact I learned repeatedly the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twZwto"&gt;Moments like these remind you that VR’s conventions are still in flux, and the fluidity of motion controls can also make them seem unreliable. But those exceptions notwithstanding, the game feels undeniably good. &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt; is a new twist on the bizarre and atmospheric world of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; and a solid addition to the still comparatively short list of robust headset-based shooters, as well as evidence that a VR adaptation doesn’t have to be seamless — it just has to find a core element that really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH2CQ4"&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;em&gt; for VR will be released October 21st exclusively for Oculus Quest 2. The game includes the &lt;/em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;em&gt; story mode; it does not include the &lt;/em&gt;Separate Ways&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Assignment Ada&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;Mercenaries &lt;em&gt;add-ons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brave browser replaces Google with its own search engine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5nq2mDdz775UnPGUvQGALJAMkw=/0x0:1244x829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70019452/image2_1_980x829.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brave Search launched in beta earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Brave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XFlq9C"&gt;Brave, the privacy-focused browser that blocks third-party ads and trackers by default, is switching to using its own search engine by default, &lt;a href="https://brave.com/search-and-web-discovery/"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The change will be applied for new users, and will affect which search engine is used via the browser’s address bar. Brave Search will replace Google in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, Qwant in France, and DuckDuckGo in Germany. More countries will be switched over in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG9AvH"&gt;It’s a significant step for Brave’s fledgling search engine, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547158/brave-search-beta-browser-private-independent-index"&gt;launched in public beta&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, since most people just take what they’re given. The search engine set as the browser default is a valuable promotion tactic, and so important that the practice has become a significant focus of antitrust scrutiny. In Europe, Google now offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525688/google-europe-android-search-provider-selection-choice-screen-pay-to-play-auction"&gt;a choice of search engines&lt;/a&gt; for Android users after it was fined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;$5 billion by EU regulators&lt;/a&gt; for, among other things, illegally tying Google search to Android. Over the years, Google has also paid companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310591/apple-google-search-engine-safari-iphone-deal-billions-regulation-antitrust"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370020/mozilla-google-firefox-search-engine-browser"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; to be the default search engine in their browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lwI2wT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As we know from experience in many browsers, the default setting is crucial for adoption”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IYBvni"&gt;“As we know from experience in many browsers, the default setting is crucial for adoption, and Brave Search has reached the quality and critical mass needed to become our default search option, and to offer our users a seamless privacy-by-default online experience,” Brave’s co-founder and CEO Brendan Eich said in a statement. He added that its search engine now handles “nearly 80 million queries per month.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkCwnt"&gt;Although the switch will boost Brave Search’s prominence with Brave users, the browser’s marketshare is so small that it doesn’t even register against established competitors like Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Opera, according to &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-202105-202105-bar"&gt;data from StatCounter&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, as of September 2021, &lt;a href="https://brave.com/transparency/"&gt;Brave claims&lt;/a&gt; that its browser had almost 40 million monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNOxJT"&gt;As well as boosting the prominence of Brave’s search engine, the move is a sign of its confidence in the new privacy-focused service. Brave Search is notable for being built on Brave’s own independent index of the web, whereas many competitors rely on a mix of results from larger indexes like Microsoft’s Bing (although Brave has said it will pull in results from other providers where it can’t produce enough of its own). The company says its search engine does not track “users, their searches, or their clicks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFzJ21"&gt;Alongside the change in default search engine, Brave is also launching a new opt-in system for users to contribute their data and help improve its search results. Brave claims its Web Discovery Project collects search and browsing data in a way that can’t be linked to individual users, and that cannot be sold to advertisers or handed over to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkUHQ0"&gt;Brave Search is currently free to use and does not show any ads, but the company says that it plans to roll out ads in its free version in the future, as well as launch an ad-free premium service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1P62nz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V24Zrg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How NFTs are creating a generational divide between platforms  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbyBZicF2WurRzWSfUKeTjt3YFA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70019384/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RrQZNW"&gt;Today, let’s talk about a fault line that’s beginning to open up in the gaming world, one I suspect will soon be coming to most platforms and app stores. It’s a divide that begins with a simple question: will your platform allow NFTs? Crypto payments? You know … &lt;em&gt;blockchain stuff&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldZEbU"&gt;Like it or not, the rise of non-fungible tokens as an engine for fun and profit has been one of the tech world’s big stories in 2021. Using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;the blockchain&lt;/a&gt; to create unique digital objects with verifiable, transferrable ownership has opened up new possibilities in art, digital trading cards, and gaming. At least for the moment, it seems likely that other forms of media will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6IMGp"&gt;Recently I’ve written about ways in which NFTs are challenging the current generation’s assumptions about gaming: building a game from the bottom up rather than the top down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft"&gt;as the Loot project is doing&lt;/a&gt;; or enabling players to make money directly from their gameplay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;as Axie Infinity is&lt;/a&gt;. Aleksander Larsen, chief operating officer of Axie’s parent company, told me that he hopes the game will come to mobile app stores, including Apple’s, within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMGAWb"&gt;But on Friday, it became clear that such games won’t be welcome everywhere. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;Mitchell Clark here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Wljyvf"&gt;Games that use blockchain technology or let users exchange NFTs or cryptocurrencies won’t be allowed on Steam, according to a rule added to &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding"&gt;Valve’s “What you shouldn’t publish on Steam” list&lt;/a&gt;. The change &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713803680473089"&gt;was pointed out by SpacePirate&lt;/a&gt;, a developer working on an NFT-based game, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713807312801796?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the change was because the company doesn’t allow game items that could have real-world value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qKCfIF"&gt;Steam, if you’re not familiar, is the largest distributor of PC gaming software in the world. With &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-14-steam-has-over-120m-monthly-active-users"&gt;more than 120 million monthly users&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the default place for most PC gamers to buy digital downloads. And last week, as some blockchain-based games had begun to appear on the platform, Steam pulled out the rug from underneath them. Parent company Valve has yet to make a comment beyond its update to the Steam rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI1me2"&gt;The developer of &lt;em&gt;Age of Rust&lt;/em&gt;, a forthcoming adventure game that will award NFTs to players who solve puzzles, was among those whose titles were removed from the platform. The developer, SpacePirate Games, lamented the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fi6Zuu"&gt;“Steam’s point of view is that items have value and they don’t allow items that can have real-world value on their platform,” the game’s official account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io/status/1448713805723099137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1448713807312801796%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F15%2F22728425%2Fvalve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “While I respect their choice, I fundamentally believe that NFTs and blockchain games are the future. It’s why I started this journey with all of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEOGEW"&gt;But when one app store door closes, another opens. The Epic Games Store, a Steam rival that the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; maker introduced in 2018, quickly said that it is “open” to considering NFT-based games. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729050/epic-game-store-open-to-blockchain-cryptocurrency-nft-games"&gt;Clark again&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CfWzy8"&gt;When we asked about allowing games that featured NFTs, Epic told us there’d be some limitations, but that it’s willing to work with “early developers” in the “new field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHGuVM"&gt;Epic says that the games would have to comply with financial laws, make it clear how the blockchain is used, and have appropriate age ratings. It also says that developers won’t be able to use Epic’s payment service to accept crypto; they would have to use their own payment systems instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="53fGLF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="laAM25"&gt;Among the reasons this came as a surprise is that just weeks earlier, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had seemed to wash his hands of the blockchain altogether. “We aren’t touching NFTs,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1442519522875949061"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “as the whole field is currently tangled up with an intractable mix of scams, interesting decentralized tech foundations, and scams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ao6tU5"&gt;Sweeney is well within the mainstream of tech commentary when he worries that NFTs are scammy. When I wrote about &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; last week, a lot of you shared similar sentiments with me in the &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/announcing-sidechannel-a-new-community"&gt;Sidechannel Discord server&lt;/a&gt; and in your email replies. Aren’t these NFT projects fundamentally pyramid schemes, you wondered; Why does any of this have to be on the blockchain at all? There are other ways to represent digital scarcity beyond the blockchain, you told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAqySP"&gt;In any case, grinding for several hours a day to make money playing a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; clone hardly sounds like most people’s idea of a good time. If it’s a full-time job, can you really even call it a game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geyIdM"&gt;Despite those objections, though, the development continues. Each day brings with it a fresh round of funding announcements for blockchain-based projects, with hundreds of millions of dollars being allocated into crypto-focused startups and VC funds. Games, which have proven to be one of the first crypto projects to attract a user base that does something other than trade money back and forth, often figure significantly in those fundraising announcements. (Here’s $4.6 million for &lt;a href="https://medium.com/yield-guild-games/ygg-raises-4-6m-from-a16z-to-accelerate-play-to-earn-gaming-7f5cbccce657"&gt;a company that rents &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; monsters to players in exchange for a slice of their income&lt;/a&gt;, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWfXJh"&gt;All of which is soon going to put platforms into the same position that Steam found itself in. Do we let these things into the store or not? The easy thing to do is to say “no” — but doing so creates an opportunity for anyone willing to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KALzk9"&gt;To be sure, the sale of in-game items has a checkered history. Blizzard’s popular dungeon crawler &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; set up an official in-game auction house a decade ago to let players sell rare swords, armor, and other goods that they had earned in virtual battle. These items weren’t unique in the way NFTs are, but they were rare and had real-world value. Unfortunately, though, Blizzard found that its auction house broke the game entirely: all of a sudden, people could simply pay to win it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YG9TG"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/09/diablo-auction-house/"&gt;Bo Moore writing in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; in 2013, when the auction house was shuttered&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zRO779"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have more dungeons, more bosses, etc. Players just play the same procession of levels on harder and harder difficulty levels, picking up better and better loot. In other words, the loot isn’t just a helping hand towards their ultimate goal – better loot &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the ultimate goal. And with the auction house, players found that the best way to obtain it was to just buy it. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJvGPu"&gt;And the next thing you know, they’re not playing the game anymore. Why would they, when the reward structure that would otherwise motivate them to play was no longer there? Without the promise of better stuff, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; was all stick and no carrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="k6XffQ"&gt;Games that develop this “pay to win” dynamic are among the most-loathed titles around — but they are &lt;a href="https://fictionhorizon.com/best-pay-to-win-games/"&gt;very much around&lt;/a&gt;. Games that offer free downloads, as many mobile games do, often allow players to pay to gain advantages over their freeloading rivals, even as it worsens the experience for most of the user base. More respectable games, like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, sell only cosmetic items. But the pay-to-win economy is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7tPv7"&gt;Of course, there’s no reason that in-game NFTs bought from third parties have to give players advantages in gameplay. A unique &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin created by a popular artist might have value to both the person who sold it and the person who bought it, and the balance of gameplay wouldn’t change at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98piSU"&gt;But even for platforms inclined to support blockchain integrations, there remain a number of hurdles to clear on the policy and user experience side. How and where does the buying and selling take place? Does the platform get a cut of the sale? And if NFTs do affect how the game is played, rather than simply how it looks, how does the developer ensure the game is balanced and accessible to a large number of players?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kjp5Jj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Platforms will be faced with a choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcoQSg"&gt;The questions are coming to gaming first, but it’s easy to imagine them cropping up elsewhere in the new economy. And when they do, platforms will be faced with a choice: shut it all down, as Steam did, and bet that the whole crypto craze will some day fall into the ocean; or be curious about it, the way Epic is, and see if there’s a way to channel all this developer enthusiasm into something creative and profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mex7uP"&gt;It’s worth noting that most big believers in the tech world’s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; big prediction about the future this year — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; — come down firmly on the side of NFT integration. Mark Zuckerberg described for Facebook employees this summer a world in which people would one day rent NFT art as decorations for parties in virtual reality. The idea of unique NFT skins that people can dress up their avatars in, and take from place to virtual place, is foundational to the metaverse as futurists most often describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adcdTS"&gt;Maybe that will all fall into the ocean, too. But one way or another, I think digital scarcity is coming to platforms. And when it does, they’ll have a lot of re-thinking to do. For now, Valve loses nothing by leaving NFTs behind. But there may come a day soon when it’s companies like Valve getting left behind, and developers like SpacePirate laughing all the way to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix boss says he “screwed up” over Chappelle special fallout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pBxNE5fsWQNw8aJuMe2O8JuGU3o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018988/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMxCI1"&gt;Mere hours before a planned walkout from Netflix’s trans and allied workers over comments made by Dave Chappelle in a recent special, co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said he “screwed up” over his response to employees over outrage from within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ryo4xU"&gt;Chappelle’s special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; debuted on the streaming service earlier this month and immediately came under fire from members and allies of the LGBTQ+ community as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;Netflix employees&lt;/a&gt; who criticized the special as being transphobic. Sarandos, for his part, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;stood by the special&lt;/a&gt;, telling employees that Netflix doesn’t allow titles on its service “that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; crosses that line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JERKz"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-ted-sarandos-i-screwed-up-1235093098/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published on the eve of the planned walkout, the Netflix executive says he “should have led with a lot more humanity” in his internal responses to his employees, though he continues to defend the special on the grounds of “creative freedom and artistic expression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RhvFi3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I should have led with a lot more humanity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0NuYa5"&gt;“Meaning, I had a group of employees who were definitely feeling pain and hurt from a decision we made. And I think that needs to be acknowledged up front before you get into the nuts and bolts of anything,” Sarandos tells the publication. “I didn’t do that. That was uncharacteristic for me, and it was moving fast and we were trying to answer some really specific questions that were floating. We landed with some things that were much more blanket and matter-of-fact that are not at all accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvzbKQ"&gt;When asked to define how Netflix defines hate speech, Sarandos said that the company draws the line “on something that would intentionally call for physically harming other people or even remove protections. For me, intent to cause physical harm crosses the line, for sure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgW4qh"&gt;Separately, Sarandos spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-walkout-1235033910/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — also for an interview published late Tuesday ahead of the planned walkout. As he did in his interview with &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Sarandos makes it clear that he stands by the special but characterizes his response to criticism of &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; as a “just very clumsy, internal communications that went public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2EoE9"&gt;In both interviews, Sarandos says he’s been meeting with Netflix employees about their position on the special. But he reiterates repeatedly in both that the company heavily values what he characterized as “artistic expression” and adds that Netflix would continue to stand by that position as part of its ethos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDGwTh"&gt;Sarandos spoke with other publications as well, including &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/netflix-ted-sarandos-speaks-up-dave-chapplle-the-closer-controversy-interview-1234858762/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-co-ceo-says-he-screwed-up-when-defending-dave-chappelle-special-11634696007"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His comments remain, by and large, the same in all of his quoted conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo reportedly developing own chips for flagship phones</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRZORTnZ9nDo2ASDfyNolvOwtAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018964/DSCF7705.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XUEALA"&gt;Oppo is developing its own high-end chips for flagship mobile phones, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/China-s-Oppo-joins-race-to-develop-own-smartphone-chips"&gt;according to a report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Two people who spoke to the newspaper said that the plan was to release custom SoCs in 2023 or 2024 “depending on the speed of development.” Oppo reportedly wants to use TSMC’s advanced 3nm process technology for the chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBVSiO"&gt;If plans come to pass, Oppo would be the latest major smartphone manufacturer to take control of its own SoC design. Yesterday Google launched the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, its first phones with a custom SoC called Tensor. Apple and Samsung also design their own smartphone chips, as did Huawei before US sanctions decimated its mobile business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z7C5N1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vXhS7y"&gt;Oppo currently uses chips from Qualcomm and MediaTek, like all other Chinese smartphone vendors since the crackdown on Huawei. Xiaomi designed and released a low-end SoC called the Surge S1 for its budget Mi 5C phone in 2017, but since then its chip design efforts have been limited to secondary components like image signal processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYRst8"&gt;As Qualcomm laid bare in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728062/qualcomm-pixel-6-google-tensor-snapdragon-meme"&gt;salty Google subtweet&lt;/a&gt; last week, it would stand to lose out if major companies like Oppo were to take on SoC design themselves. Oppo is the fourth largest smartphone maker in the world by shipments, according to IDC, and given it shares a supply chain and ownership with Vivo, Realme and OnePlus, Oppo-developed chips could quickly find their way into phones from multiple brands.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The IATSE’s strike-averting deal means better pay on streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="los angeles iatse union film strike" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1orzywPxpvjdbwdmWMEgCnui-Mk=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018878/1235538479.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TyhxQH"&gt;Streaming services may pay up to 30 percent more to production workers as part of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees’ (IATSE) deal with major Hollywood studios to avert a strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFiIrw"&gt;The union tweeted a document that specifically outlined the new streaming terms of the tentative Basic Agreement. According to the one-sheet, the new agreement would secure higher wages for episodic streaming productions, including longform miniseries with runtimes longer than 66 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZweH5c"&gt;Payouts on some miniseries could increase up to 30 percent, which will depend on how the project is classified. Longform productions that cost between $20 and $32 million, meanwhile, will no longer get a discount on account of the production heading to a streaming service. This type of production, too, will see a rate increase of up to 30 percent in some cases, the union said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EXbSm2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW: We are releasing our first three one page documents explaining how the new tentative Basic Agreement addresses the priorities members identified early in the bargaining process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a non-exhaustive set of member priorities, more soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. STREAMING IMPROVEMENTS &lt;a href="https://t.co/ACLP5cbLiv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ACLP5cbLiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— IATSE // #IASolidarity (@IATSE) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IATSE/status/1450646990279282689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nuMNS0"&gt;Production crew represented by IATSE who are working on low-budget productions of 20 minutes or longer will get better wages, terms, and conditions, but the details are vague. The document specified only that this category of productions was tentatively to be “set at no less than the mid-budget wages, terms and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKTizU"&gt;The union also tweeted fact sheets related to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IATSE/status/1450647001922670593/photo/1"&gt;wages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IATSE/status/1450646995790598146/photo/1"&gt;workplace conditions&lt;/a&gt; — both points of contention as the union worked to negotiate with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for better labor protections for its members. Much is left unclear by the one-sheets, however, particularly where it relates to streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPJjr6"&gt;“We intend to provide as much information [as] possible, and as soon as possible,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IATSE/status/1450647003403374594"&gt;the union said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “That way, each of us will have a chance to get the full picture and make an informed decision regarding our shared future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3DzGR"&gt;As negotiations between the IATSE and AMPTP stalled prior to last week, the union’s members &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;voted nearly unanimously&lt;/a&gt; to strike — an event that was planned for this week should contract negotiations continue to be held up. The strike was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22731087/hollywood-union-reaches-contract-agreement-iatse-avoids-strike"&gt;narrowly avoided&lt;/a&gt; when a tentative agreement was reached between the two organizations over the weekend. The contract must be ratified by the union’s members, however, some of whom have characterized the terms as &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/iatse-deal-backlash-nothing-changed-1235091286/"&gt;failing to meet their demands&lt;/a&gt;. Members could ultimately choose to vote against it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is planning to rebrand the company with a new name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fBUh6E31xNvLxZx6U-nbWG7s13k=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018751/acastro_072121_4674_zuckerberg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BQkSw"&gt;Facebook is planning to change its company name next week to reflect its focus on building the metaverse, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dN7MdP"&gt;The coming name change, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to talk about at the company’s annual Connect conference on October 28th, but could unveil sooner, is meant to signal the tech giant’s ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that entail. The rebrand would likely position the blue Facebook app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and more. A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJZxHn"&gt;Facebook already has more than 10,000 employees building consumer hardware like AR glasses that Zuckerberg believes will eventually be as ubiquitous as smartphones. In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that, over the next several years, “we will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eDDMp5"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/0ouoP9Qb96XMgfT5kt5ZEk" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JSxAWP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym4ZFM"&gt;A rebrand could also serve to further separate the futuristic work Zuckerberg is focused on from the intense scrutiny Facebook is currently under for the way its social platform operates today. A former employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen, recently leaked a trove of damning internal documents to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified about them before Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Antitrust regulators in the US and elsewhere are trying to break the company up, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22702798/verge-tech-survey-2021-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple-pandemic"&gt;public trust&lt;/a&gt; in how Facebook does business is falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hB6AhR"&gt;Facebook isn’t the first well-known tech company to change its company name as its ambitions expand. In 2015, Google reorganized entirely under a holding company called Alphabet, partly to signal that it was no longer just a search engine, but a sprawling conglomerate with companies making driverless cars and health tech. And Snapchat rebranded to Snap Inc. in 2016, the same year it started calling itself a “camera company” and debuted its first pair of Spectacles camera glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl2grI"&gt;I’m told that the new Facebook company name is a closely-guarded secret within its walls and not known widely, even among its full senior leadership. A possible name could have something to do with Horizon, the name of the still-unreleased VR version of Facebook-meets-Roblox that the company has been developing for the past few years. The name of that app was recently tweaked to &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-horizon-changes/"&gt;Horizon Worlds&lt;/a&gt; shortly after Facebook demoed a version for workplace collaboration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;called Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ww3bJx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has been laying the groundwork for a branding change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PiMXev"&gt;Aside from Zuckerberg’s comments, Facebook has been steadily laying the groundwork for a greater focus on the next generation of technology. This past summer it set up a dedicated metaverse team. More recently, it announced that the head of AR and VR, Andrew Bosworth, will be promoted to chief technology officer. And just a couple of days ago Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-plans-hire-10000-eu-build-metaverse-2021-10-17/"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to hire 10,000 more employees to work on the metaverse in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7m6rI"&gt;The metaverse is “going to be a big focus, and I think that this is just going to be a big part of the next chapter for the way that the internet evolves after the mobile internet,” Zuckerberg told &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Casey Newton&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this summer. “And I think it’s going to be the next big chapter for our company too, really doubling down in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="av8JCk"&gt;Complicating matters is that, while Facebook has been heavily promoting the idea of the metaverse in recent weeks, it’s still not a concept that’s widely understood. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;The term was coined&lt;/a&gt; originally by sci-fi novelist Neal Stephenson to describe a virtual world people escape to from a dystopian, real world. Now it’s being adopted by one of the world’s largest and most controversial companies — and it’ll have to explain why its own virtual world is worth diving into.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard is trying to get the discrimination suit thrown out of court</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard employees stage a walkout in the response from company leadership to a lawsuit highlighting alleged harassment, inequality" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WG-BdiDrd3SmWZfeUX5KmcGmAHI=/10x0:4191x2787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70018394/1234304012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zy4EVP"&gt;Activision Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;facing a discrimination lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt; (or DFEH), has filed an application to stay that lawsuit so it can investigate claims that DFEH lawyers engaged in ethical misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ib1oil"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21088626-activision-blizzard-et-als-ex-parte-application-to-stay-the-case/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, ET AL.'S EX PARTE APPLICATION TO STAY THE CASE (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zB7gp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7VHZD"&gt;The application claims that the DFEH is represented in the case by lawyers who previously worked for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or EEOC)  — a federal agency that investigates claims of workplace abuse. The application additionally claims such an arrangement is in violation of a California State Bar conflict of interest rule that says, “a lawyer who has formerly served as a public official or employee of the government [...] shall not otherwise represent a client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public official or employee.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SPcln"&gt;The application basically alleges that DFEH lawyers should be disqualified from participating in this case against Activision Blizzard since those lawyers previously worked on a similar, prior case against the company when they were employed by the EEOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06wp5V"&gt;Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;recently settled&lt;/a&gt; another discrimination lawsuit brought forth by the EEOC for $18 million. The DFEH is trying to block that settlement, and it’s actually the EEOC that raised ethical concerns against DFEH lawyers (perhaps to maintain its win). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ahjdh"&gt;“The EEOC claims that two of the DFEH attorneys who have appeared in this case (and who currently ‘play leadership roles within the [DFEH]’) ‘previously served as EEOC [REDACTED],’ during which time they ‘helped to direct the EEOC’s investigation’ against Activision Blizzard,” the application states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DRnRk"&gt;If the court upholds the stay and decides that DFEH lawyers did violate conflict of interest rules, Activision Blizzard claims the case could be in serious trouble. According to the company’s filing, “Violation of these rules could lead to the disqualification not only of the two attorneys at issue, but of the entire group of DFEH attorneys with whom they have worked. It also calls into question the integrity of the underlying investigation itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpZOho"&gt;This move comes just as Blizzard announced 20 employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735413/activision-blizzard-employee-terminations-harassment-discrimination"&gt;“exited” the company&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of harassment investigations and reprimanded some 20 more. In the months since these lawsuits were made public, some Blizzard employees have continued to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;agitate for a more equitable workplace&lt;/a&gt;, making demands of the company to end forced arbitration and provide greater pay transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZHbSbD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our demands remain as follows and chief suite still fails to acknowledge them. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ABetterABK?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ABetterABK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndAbuseInGaming?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EndAbuseInGaming&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Tk7aV9DjD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Tk7aV9DjD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ABetterABK   ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1433466353726361603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KmeZxZ"&gt;The EEOC and the DFEH didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, and neither the DFEH nor the EEOC have had a chance to formally challenge Activision Blizzard’s claims: neither have filed responses to this application in the courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMmKNQ"&gt;A Blizzard spokesperson says of the filings, “We look forward to resolving the case with the DFEH fairly in an appropriate court. We share the EEOC and DFEH’s goal of a safe, inclusive workplace that rewards employees equitably and remain committed to the elimination of harassment and discrimination in our workplace.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isd4s9"&gt;A hearing on the application will take place October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
