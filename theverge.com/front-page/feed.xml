    <title>Elon Musk and Bitcoin miners say they want to address crypto’s sustainability problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4SZ1Vd2Zzv2NMfI2C6JmD5eZlWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336385/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Soup7D"&gt;MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted Monday that after a weekend meeting with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and “leading Bitcoin miners in North America,” the group has agreed to form a Bitcoin Mining Council, “to promote energy usage transparency [and] accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijrn2K"&gt;Musk tweeted earlier in the day that the group “committed to publish current &amp;amp; planned renewable usage &amp;amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.”  According to Saylor, the group included representatives from Argo Blockchain, Blockcap, Core Scientific, Galaxy Digital, Hive Blockchain Technologies, Hut 8 Mining, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2iIeuW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday I was pleased to host a meeting between &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; the leading Bitcoin miners in North America.  The miners have agreed to form the Bitcoin Mining Council to promote energy usage transparency &amp;amp; accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EHgLZ9zvDK"&gt;https://t.co/EHgLZ9zvDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1396915801492439044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TuHGDA"&gt;Emails to each of the companies Saylor referenced were not immediately returned Monday, but a spokesperson from Galaxy &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-bounces-back-above-37-120715542.html"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a representative participated in the call. Several other of the companies mentioned tweeted their support for the plan.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hut8Mining/status/1396918166257901573"&gt;Hut 8 Mining&lt;/a&gt; confirmed it was part of the discussions Saylor referenced, tweeting that it would “educate the market that sustainable mining is possible and a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVljm1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterGWall/status/1396916203587870722"&gt;Argo Blockchain CEO Peter Wall tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “as a founding member of the Bitcoin Mining Council, Argo will push hard for sustainable mining and more transparency. This is the way!” Merrick Okamoto, executive chairman at Marathon Digital Holdings &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mokamoto/status/1396918030987259904?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; the company would do its part “to contribute to sustainable mining and transparency.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PSD1N"&gt;While Tesla began accepting Bitcoin as payment for vehicles in March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;Musk reversed that position&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, as he expressed concern for the environment. “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Since then he’s made note several times of cryptocurrency’s sustainability problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNKVja"&gt;Bitcoin mining uses a significant amount of electricity, using as much annually &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;as the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, according to one estimate. That’s at odds with Tesla’s stated mission to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” Specifics about how the miners planned to tackle Bitcoin’s environmental issues — whether through making changes to the blockchain or using carbon offsetting measures as large corporations do — weren’t available Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCeSK2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WC5HY4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Sweeney concludes Epic v. Apple trial by repping fried chicken</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Popularity Of Fast Food Chicken Helps Drive Nationwide Chicken Shortages And Price Increases" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MrAeYmusQ7K1rxr8DBPzjusyBY0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336362/1316692250.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbTtvW"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is a man who says what’s on his mind, even if it’ll ruffle a few feathers. And apparently the first thing on his mind, following today’s closing remarks in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;, was chicken dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EobiP5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Epic vs Apple trial has now concluded! I won’t be commenting before the verdict is delivered. Thanks to everyone whose efforts made this possible, and to Popeyes for building a fine restaurant next door to the Oakland federal courthouse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xma2xyRBtW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xma2xyRBtW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1396919697409417218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe1eu4"&gt;Winner winner, wishful thinking? Perhaps. After all, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; competitor &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; does love its chicken, and there’s been plenty&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of time &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1019852527007944704?lang=en"&gt;for Apple’s subliminal messaging&lt;/a&gt; to kick in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgSdZG"&gt;Besides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H5Jm6B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TIM SWEENEY WENT TO POPEYES BEFORE SHOWING HIS NEXT GEN ENGINE &lt;a href="https://t.co/ckSXCRMJte"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ckSXCRMJte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— KZ  ️ (@KZXcellent) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KZXcellent/status/1260590366295760904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>‘Rogue’ Commerce unit scanned social media for Census disinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0yoqH0EV_9jYqaH5iMl9ZV1Fv4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335634/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A1oOW"&gt;A security unit within the US Commerce Department monitored Americans’ Twitter accounts for posts critical of the US Census and conducted unauthorized surveillance to gather information about US citizens and foreign visitors, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536492/ITMS_Fact_Sheet_05_18_2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;according to a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; released Monday by the ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz9SfT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/05/24/commerce-department-monitoring-itms/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; first reported on the existence of the unit&lt;/a&gt;, which is called the Investigations and Threat Management Service (ITMS). According to the fact sheet, ITMS had its operations suspended as of May 14th, after an investigation launched in February by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) showed that the service had conducted “a variety of improper activities dating back to the mid-2000s, involving abuse of authority, mismanagement, and reprisal against [Commerce] Department employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9nXp3"&gt;Wicker’s memo claims that ITMS “surveilled social media activity on Twitter to monitor accounts that posted commentary critical of processes used to conduct the US Census.” The apparent goal of this surveillance was to show off ITMS’s “intelligence-gathering capabilities by linking those accountholders— members of the general public— to disinformation campaigns orchestrated by foreign governments.” This kind of misinformation campaign typically involves troll farms: groups of people paid by governments sowing wrong or misleading information on social media. But there’s no evidence such an effort was ever aimed at discrediting the census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Fr8F"&gt;The social media posts collected by ITMS were added to a spreadsheet called the Social Media Tracker, which was used to conduct searches on secure intelligence databases of social media account holders, the&lt;em&gt; Post&lt;/em&gt; reported. One example: the ITMS opened a case after a 68-year-old retiree in Florida with around 100 Twitter followers tweeted that the Census would “be corrupted and falsified to benefit the Trump Party.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqIQBG"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reported that ITMS referred information about social media posts to the FBI, which declined to investigate since the posts constituted protected speech. It did not appear from Wicker’s memo or the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; story that any of these social media “investigations” ever led to charges of any kind; indeed, the ITMS opened some 1,000 cases but “few resulted in arrests or criminal charges,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZyNtZ"&gt;The Commerce Department did not reply to a request for comment Monday. Wicker said an official report on the ITMS’s activities will be released in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n52hot"&gt;“Over time, the ITMS began regularly conducting criminal investigations and eventually began using counterintelligence tools to gather information about both foreign visitors and U.S. citizens––despite lacking any proper form of authorization,” Wicker wrote in his fact sheet, adding that “ITMS has mutated into a rogue, unaccountable police force without a clear mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLKrI4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s brilliant, 75-inch LED TV is $600 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdSDYS2tQdXxrPwSaR2_fXYLmHA=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335608/X950H_NH65_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Each model in Sony’s X950H series is known for its impressive color accuracy and wide viewing angles. | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oNG3cP"&gt;If you’re looking for a behemoth 4K TV with impressive motion handling, solid black levels, and vibrant colors right out of the box, it’s hard to go wrong with the Sony X950H series. Sony’s 75-inch HDR display is not cheap at $2,600, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741484251594553089" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0846NF2B4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FSNXBR75X950H%2FSony-XBR75X950H-75-X950H-4K-Ultra-HD-Full-Array-LED-Smart-TV-2020-Model&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F24%2F22451512%2Fsony-4k-tv-noise-canceling-headphones-apple-airpods-pro-amazon-echo-dot-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt; are all currently offering the TV for $600 off the initial list price, bringing it down to $2,000. The X950H model also sports four HDMI ports, compatibility with both Alexa and Google Assistant, and a host of Android TV features. It’s one of the best deals we’ve seen on Sony’s premium LED in recent months, especially when you consider that BuyDig is throwing in a $100 Visa gift card with each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1L0oMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10516242"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdPnUY"&gt;We’ve gushed about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; on many occasions — and why shouldn’t we? The wireless headphones remain our top picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, namely due to their excellent noise-cancellation capabilities and support for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. The latest model also features enhanced microphones, allowing for improved voice chats, and the same all-day comfort as its predecessors. If you happened to have missed the previous sales on the WH-1000XMH4, the black option is still available via &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F284230046954%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeSony75inchTV052421%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F24%2F22451512%2Fsony-4k-tv-noise-canceling-headphones-apple-airpods-pro-amazon-echo-dot-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay retailer Pro-Distributing&lt;/a&gt; for $260, a $90 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rpp0pi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f1VPh1"&gt;If you prefer noise-canceling earbuds over traditional headphones, you’re in luck. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeSony75inchTV052421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt; are still offering 21 percent off the AirPods Pro, meaning you can pick up a pair of Apple’s iconic earbuds for $197. If you’re unfamiliar with the popular Bluetooth earbuds, just know that they offer superb sound with active noise cancellation, along with deep software integration with iOS and an in-ear design that should accommodate most people. If you’re an Android user or simply prefer an alternative, we’ve also rounded up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="T62iRb"&gt;If you haven’t been following Amazon as closely as us, sifting through its robust catalog of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;current- and last-gen Echo devices&lt;/a&gt; can be overwhelming. If you’re looking for a cheap entryway into the Amazon ecosystem, however, Woot is offering the third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=Verge75InchTV052421+&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fecho-dot-kids-edition-blue-7%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition for a mere $25&lt;/a&gt;.

The parental controls are just a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sB9UIL"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE (Fan Edition) could be officially launching soon according to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/de/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/galaxy-tab-s7-fe-5g-black-64gb-5g-sm-t736bzkaeub/#benefits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new German product page&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123088.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The tablet appears to be a renamed version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356129/samsung-tab-a7-lite-tablet-leak-camera-specs-display-s7"&gt;the previously leaked “Galaxy Tab S7 Plus Lite”&lt;/a&gt; that first made the rounds in March 2021. The Galaxy Tab S7 FE is the first Fan Edition of one of Samsung’s tablets, a tweaked version of the earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;iPad Pro-inspired 12.4-inch Tab S7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AA5fpw"&gt;While the Tab S7 FE shares the same 12.4-inch screen size as the older Tab S7 Plus, it appears to be using a TFT LCD display, like the 11-inch Tab S7, rather than the OLED found in the Tab S7 Plus. Another cost-saving measure is found in the processor: the Tab S7 FE has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449747/qualcomm-snapdragon-750g-5g-faster-cpu-gpu-ai-engine-smartphone-processor"&gt;a Snapdragon 750G&lt;/a&gt; octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM. For storage, the tablet comes with 64GB of UFS memory, which is partially used by the device’s One UI skinned version of Android 11, and expandable with a microSD card. The Tab S7 FE hangs on to the optional 5G support of its more expensive siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8iwJg0K1HsfvNb29-tamgYYxNE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536507/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_11.16.22_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 Fan Edition with optional S Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nqsnFB"&gt;If you happen to be a tablet photographer, the Tab S7 FE includes an 8-megapixel back camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. In a plus for anyone who’s complained about camera orientation on the iPad Pro, the Tab S7 FE’s front-facing camera is in landscape orientation, perfect for long Zoom calls. To get the device through those long calls, the FE has a 10,090mAh battery, which Samsung claims should last up to 12 hours on LTE (oddly, no estimate is given for 5G), and 13 hours specifically for video playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FPLR8a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10516396"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXFYNY"&gt;The FE can come with an optional S Pen for note-taking tricks like converting handwriting to text. The tablet also has Samsung DeX, which can add Windows-esque interface elements like a taskbar, window-ing, and a “Start menu” automatically when you attach a keyboard. Whether any of those tablet features can elevate the FE into a true productivity device for you is harder to say. We found the Tab S7 and S7 Plus to still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;work best for simpler tablet tasks&lt;/a&gt; like video watching and web browsing rather a whole day of work. Nothing about the Fan Edition suggests that will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yk1uaE"&gt;The Galaxy Tab S7 Fan Edition currently isn’t for sale in Germany (you can sign up to be notified when it’s available) and is priced at €649 (approximately $792) for either the silver or black version. That’s less than the typical price of a base Galaxy Tab S7 in Germany (€698) and for the larger screen size of a €979 S7 Plus. Should the Tab S7 FE come to the US, it will likely cost less than the rough conversion of the German price to US dollars. We’ve reached out to Samsung and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp7wMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says Samsung has other colors and models with different specs in the works as well. We’ll keep an eye out for an official announcement in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos finally stops pretending its compressed photos are ‘high quality’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1__CshYHMMXPuvqDCZhAkprx8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335370/vpavic_4113_20200724_0090.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d2uhBl"&gt;Are you planning to stick with Google Photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;when its free unlimited storage disappears on June 1st&lt;/a&gt;? If you’re anything like me, you’re probably still struggling to figure out whether you can afford to procrastinate that decision a little bit longer — and today, Google has made that reckoning &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/4-things-know-about-google-photos-storage-policy-change/"&gt;a little bit easier&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwSFlt"&gt;First off, the company’s finally telling it like it is: Google will no longer pretend its compressed, lower-quality photos and videos are “High quality,” something that would have saved me a lengthy explanation just last week! (After June 1st, existing Google Pixel phone owners still get unlimited “High quality” photos, but if you’re on, say, a Samsung or iPhone instead, it’s not like there was ever a “Normal quality” photo that doesn’t count against the new 15GB limit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9jQt3b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bye “high,” hello “saver”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gkhdhp"&gt;Soon, “Storage saver” will be the name for Google’s normal-quality photos, formerly known as “High quality.” You’ll be able to upload at either the “Storage saver” or “Original quality” tiers, both of which will count against your storage quota, with “Original quality” using more data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDk8WC"&gt;What if you’ve already got 10GB worth of Gmail and 2GB of documents stored in a Google Drive like yours truly, leaving just 3GB left for photos before you’ll need to pay? First off, know that your existing “High quality” photos before June 1st don’t count against the quota — but also, Google has a new tool to help you find and delete blurry photos and large videos to help you free up even more space.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TeJnROAVvnRDz_DBC8U554V2iqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536518/GooglePhotos_Blog_GIF01.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TByuV3"&gt;You can find it in the “Manage storage” section of the app, as you can see in the GIF above. It’ll also help you find and delete screenshots, though that’s been a feature of Google Photos for a while now. Google also promises to notify users who are nearing their quota, and you can &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/storage"&gt;click here for a storage estimate&lt;/a&gt; if you’re logged into your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtuXV3"&gt;Still confused, perhaps? I wouldn’t blame you; it took a while for me to get it all straight in my head, particularly considering that Google offers different levels of grandfathered free storage &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;hl=en#zippy=%2Coriginal-quality%2Cexpress-backup%2Chigh-quality%2Cpixel%2Cpixel-a-"&gt;depending on which Pixel phone you own&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an attempt to condense that info for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="atK09r"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Everyone, including non-Pixel owners&lt;/strong&gt;: Anything you upload before June 1st, 2021, won’t count against your 15GB quota&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i96ckK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, Pixel 5: &lt;/strong&gt;You also still get unlimited free “Storage saver,” aka “High quality” images going forward, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; “Original quality”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="raLh86"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/strong&gt;: You still get unlimited free “Original quality” photos and videos &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you upload them before January 1st, 2022, after which you get unlimited “Storage saver” going forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DVmW7o"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel 2: &lt;/strong&gt;You got (past tense) unlimited free “Original quality” photos and videos &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you uploaded them before January 16th, 2021, and you get unlimited “Storage saver” going forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dl47Mt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pixel (2016): &lt;/strong&gt;You get unlimited free “Original quality” photos and videos until your phone kicks the bucket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="50OHrG"&gt;Future Google phones won’t have these perks: existing Pixels will be the last to come with free unlimited “High quality” uploads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562908/google-future-pixel-phone-no-unlimited-photos-storage-confirmed"&gt;Google confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose a photo storage service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Photos on the Google Pixel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYXwhBgMRaP0gsWNtPB0Z6ePB8k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67778301/google_photos_vlad_savov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9HfSI"&gt;Last November, Google — which until now has offered unlimited storage for what it called “high quality” (read: compressed) photos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;announced that “unlimited” is being changed&lt;/a&gt; to “up to 15GB on your Google account.” (Oh, and “high quality” is being renamed “storage saver.”) In other words, while photo and video storage currently does not count against your total of 15 free gigs on a Google account, it will as of this coming June 1st — along with your Gmail, Google Drive files, and other stored data. Once you hit that 15GB wall, you will have to buy into the Google One service to increase your storage capacity. (Unless you own a Pixel 5 or earlier device, in which case you still have no limits on “high quality” photos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTbl7b"&gt;If you’re a Google Photos user who finds all of this a bit irritating, you may be thinking of leaving. But first, it’s a good idea to check out your alternatives. Below are some of the main photo storage services available to you, along with their basic fees, so you can figure out whether you want to switch. (Note: We’ve only included services that are specifically geared toward photos, not more general storage services such as OneDrive or Dropbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chKhYl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXH35MCZPB-qOWTZMXZFKj3STjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504078/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.57.42_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qoZVjQ"&gt;Google provides each of its accounts with 15GB of free storage. However, for the last few years, photos have been treated differently: under its “high quality” plan, Google stored an unlimited number of photos for free as long as you allow them to be compressed to 16 megapixels. (According to Google, photos that size can be printed without issue up to 24 x 16 inches.) Videos were kept to a maximum of 1080p. (Data such as closed captions could be eliminated to save space.) “Original quality” photos — those that were not compressed — were not part of this unlimited plan but were counted as regular files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5YwJy"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/4-things-know-about-google-photos-storage-policy-change/"&gt;all of that is changing&lt;/a&gt;. As mentioned above, starting on June 1st, 2021, Google will be including photos in its storage calculations. Once you hit that 15GB ceiling, you will have to buy into the &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;Google One service&lt;/a&gt; for additional storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXGQL"&gt;Google One currently starts at 100GB of storage for $1.99 a month ($19.99 a year) and proceeds to 200GB for $2.99 a month ($29.99 a year) or 2TB for $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year). The 2TB plan also comes with a VPN for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxaryX"&gt;Before you run to invest in Google One, be aware that there are several mitigating factors Google is offering its users. When the new plan goes into effect, that is when the clock starts; photos you uploaded before then won’t count toward your 15GB limit. Also, if you own a Pixel 5 or earlier model phone, then you can continue to upload “high-quality” / “storage saver” photos without affecting your 15GB limit. (Of course, Pixel owners used to get unlimited “original quality” photos for free. But hey, it’s something.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtZGxP"&gt;Google is rolling out some tools to help confused users, including one that &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/storage"&gt;estimates how much time you have left&lt;/a&gt; before you have to purchase more storage space (based on previous usage), and one that will help you discard blurry photos, too-large videos, and other items that may take up space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTIED4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/photos"&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iCloud Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHlPR3hHSzYXLHM4BHWLPypgyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045506/Screen_Shot_2020_11_16_at_9.50.00_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIMWLM"&gt;If you’re part of Apple’s ecosystem, then you have easy access to iCloud Photos, Apple’s equivalent to Google Photos. iCloud Photos is connected to the Phone app on your Mac or iOS device as a backup for your photos. You automatically get 5GB of storage space associated with your iCloud account; after that, it costs 99 cents per month for 50GB, $2.99 per month for 200GB, and $9.99 per month for 2TB. (This is for the US; &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"&gt;other countries have different fees&lt;/a&gt;.) Windows users can also access iCloud Photos via an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283"&gt;associated app&lt;/a&gt;; Android users will have to access it using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yZr3Oh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flickr page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rs5L-CTH_oyitP0u2yut9q5965c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13692625/flickr_interface.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flickr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0WoADA"&gt;Flickr has a free plan as well, but it’s limited to 1,000 photos — within certain guidelines: photo files are limited to 200MB and video files to 1GB. For &lt;a href="https://help.flickr.com/pricing-faq-r1qHsTEbU"&gt;unlimited storage without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you pay either $6.99 a month or $59.99 annually (plus tax). Other advantages to a paid annual membership include stats about which of your photos are trending and a variety of discounts from several companies, including Adobe and SmugMug (which is now part of Flickr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BrJgci"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smugmug.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Smugmug" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w07DX4OmmluqYJWke4hyZfYgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22032766/smugmug.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: SmugMug&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmugMug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mH6JCv"&gt;Speaking of SmugMug, this long-lasting service is also available, offering storage, portfolios, and sales opportunities for professionals. For $55 a year or $7 a month, you get unlimited uploads and a customizable website. The Power plan ($85 a year or $11 monthly) adds site customization and your own domain name. If you’re looking to be a professional photographer, the Portfolio plan adds e-commerce features for $200 a year or $27 a month (you keep 85 percent of the markup). And finally, the Pro plan lets you create events, price lists, and branded orders, among other features, for $360 a year or $42 a month. If you’re interested in trying it out, you can get a two-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3pftc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://500px.com/"&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="500px" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OvSPHukZyZ_L03o3HavAkQfYvd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045546/500px_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: 500px&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;500px&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YKFo5I"&gt;Canadian company 500px is actually more for professional photographers than your average snap-and-save picture taker. It offers pros a place to store, exhibit, and license their work. So if you have ambitions to start peddling your photos, 500px may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oJbxb"&gt;The site offers two paid plans. The first, modestly named Awesome, offers unlimited uploads, priority support, no ads, a history of “liked” photos, gallery slideshows, and a profile badge for $59.88 a year or $4.99 monthly. The Pro plan adds a way to display your services and organization tools for $119.88 a year or $9.99 monthly. (You get a discount on your first year: Awesome costs $47.88 a year or $3.99 monthly, while Pro goes for $71.88 a year or $5.99 monthly.) And if you want to make a bit of money, you can submit your photos to be licensed for stock usage through 500px. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67i7IV"&gt;There is a free ad-supported plan that gives you seven uploads a week. When you sign up, you can try out the Pro plan for two weeks before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZgbkNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.photobucket.com/explore"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photobucket" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRnWvdW4CSwYhI3v_juEr5ai-1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504081/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.54.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photobucket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fui9Kk"&gt;Photobucket offers a limited free plan, allowing you to upload up to 250 photos for free — more a trial plan than anything else. If you like what you see, you can start with the Beginner plan at $5.99 per month or $64.68 annually, which gives you 25GB of storage, along with no ads, password-protected album sharing, and an image editor. For $7.99 per month or $86.28 annually, the Intermediate plan provides 250GB of storage and unlimited image hosting. Finally, for $12.99 per month or $140.28 annually, the Expert plan offers unlimited storage and no image compression, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1bm9gL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z7uIFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt; calls itself “the world’s largest art community” with a social network for visual artists of all kinds. It offers visitors a wide range of artist galleries to view, divided into categories such as traditional, animation, and illustrations. DeviantArt (or DA for short) even has its own publishing platform called Sta.sh — emphasizing the fact that this site, like 500px, is less for simple storage and more for showing (and selling) your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YBRVT"&gt;With a free membership in DeviantArt, there are no restrictions on how much you upload for public access, and you get admission to DA’s community of artists and art lovers. &lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/core-membership/"&gt;Core Members enjoy additional perks&lt;/a&gt;. For $3.95 a month or $39.95 a year, you get to sell your art with no service fee (but a 20 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales) and a $100 max price per digital item, along with 20GB of private storage space in Sta.sh. For $7.95 a month or $79.95 a year, you can charge up to $1,000 per item and pay a 12 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales, along with 30GB of private storage. Finally, $14.95 a month or $149.95 a year lets you charge up to $10,000 per item, lowers your fee to 10 percent fee per sale, and gets you 50GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iBQOi3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage"&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyGvuT12uD0xtAZPBYAG3hjy6Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504092/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.58.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRZOow"&gt;Amazon provides its Prime members with a grab bag of extras along with the free shipping. In addition to the video offerings, music streaming, and other goodies, you get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos"&gt;unlimited photo storage&lt;/a&gt; for $119 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzQzPt"&gt;A nice perk is that you can share that unlimited storage with five friends or family members in what is called the Family Vault. Everything there is accessible to everyone who shares the Vault. “Unlimited,” by the way, does not include videos or other files; for those, Prime members get 5GB of storage, and after that, there is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage/plans"&gt;a long list of storage plans&lt;/a&gt; available starting from $1.99 a month for 100GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJVY1"&gt;That’s something to keep in mind if you drop your Prime membership. In that case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201480950"&gt;according to the Amazon instructions&lt;/a&gt;, “the unlimited photo storage benefits associated with the membership end. All uploaded photos count toward your Amazon Drive storage limit.” The total storage for non-Prime members (stills and video) is 5GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nIl4Rl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdegoo.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Degoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Degoo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bZluEe"&gt;Unlike 500px and DeviantArt, which are tailored more toward professional creators, Degoo is geared toward the everyday photographer who uses images to make memories. In fact, the site touts its AI engine, which it says will “show you the best moments of your life.” To that end, its free ad-based version provides 100GB of storage; you can view or download photos on an unlimited number of devices but only upload from three. You also have to access your account at least every 90 days to keep it active. Paid accounts include Pro ($2.99 / month), which removes the ads and time limit and gives you 500GB of storage, and Ultimate ($9.99 / month), which gives you a whopping 10TB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk called lidar a ‘crutch,’ but now Tesla is reportedly testing Luminar’s laser sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x70vRVQhXl2DuRlKlGYm_xN0b4g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335101/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MYDxVn"&gt;A Tesla Model Y was photographed in Florida sporting rooftop lidar sensors made by buzzy sensor manufacturer Luminar. The sighting caused a bit of a stir among Tesla watchers, given Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s well-established disdain for the laser sensors commonly used by autonomous vehicle companies to create 3D maps of their environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjfeGd"&gt;Even more notably, Tesla has reportedly entered a partnership with Luminar to use lidar for “testing and developing,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/tesla-testing-luminar-laser-sensor-musk-called-fool-s-errand?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly this partnership entails we don’t know for sure — neither company is commenting. But it could point to some shortcomings in the technology Tesla is using to power its “Full Self-Driving” driver assist feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RB5XIZ"&gt;The vehicle was spotted last week in Palm Beach, Florida, by Grayson Brulte, a consultant for the AV industry who lives in the area. After Brulte tweeted the photos of the Model Y with a rooftop rack of lidar sensors on May 20th, Luminar’s stock surged to its highest level yet. (The Florida-based company recently went public after being acquired by a “blank check” special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TrxEnU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spotted in Palm Beach, Florida. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Tesla&lt;/a&gt; Model Y with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiDAR?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LiDAR&lt;/a&gt; and CA Manufacturing (MFG) Plates. Can anyone offer details/insights? &lt;a href="https://t.co/5Uh4WU0U41"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5Uh4WU0U41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Grayson Brulte (@gbrulte) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gbrulte/status/1395356317410287617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vfYLQL"&gt;Luminar sold the lidar to Tesla as part of an agreement between the two companies, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Also, the Model Y was sporting a manufacturer’s license plate that is registered to Tesla in California. The same plate has been spotted on other Tesla vehicles, including a prototype of the Cybertruck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JgYEV"&gt;It’s unlikely that Tesla will reverse its position on lidar based on a single vehicle. As Guidehouse’s Sam Abuelsamid told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, it’s more likely that Tesla is using Luminar’s lidar to validate its Full Self-Driving feature. But it’s still a noteworthy development given Musk’s vocal animosity toward the sensor. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988628/elon-musk-lidar-self-driving-car-tesla"&gt;In a 2018 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said, “In my view, it’s a crutch that will drive companies to a local maximum that they will find very hard to get out of.” He added, “Perhaps I am wrong, and I will look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z43CvF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Perhaps I am wrong, and I will look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mP3y8d"&gt;Then a year later, he called lidar “a fool’s errand” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;during a presentation on Tesla’s efforts to build fully autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. “[A]nyone relying on LIDAR is doomed,” he added. “Doomed. Expensive sensors that are unnecessary. It’s like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices... you’ll see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xWvu1"&gt;Musk said Tesla is trying to tackle a much bigger problem: passive optical recognition. This is why Tesla is banking on cameras as the key piece of hardware for autonomous vehicles. With their ever-increasing pixel resolution and the low price point, camera sensors are seen as indispensable for advanced driver assistance systems (like Tesla’s Autopilot) and fully autonomous systems. For Tesla, cameras are everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9feS5"&gt;Musk also walked back some of those comments in recent months. In a chat on Clubhouse, Musk admitted to “talking smack” about lidar but noted that SpaceX — his other company — has developed its own versions of the laser sensors to assist the Dragon capsule. In a recent earnings call, Musk spoke about moving away from using radar, stating, “We believe that a vision-only system is ultimately all that is needed for full autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvzjKg"&gt;Luminar, which is based in Florida, went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398974/luminar-lidar-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merge-blank-check"&gt;public last year via a reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a SPAC. That merger valued the company at approximately $2.9 billion in “implied pro forma enterprise value,” with an equity value of $3.4 billion at closing. Luminar is also working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22424726/pony-ai-luminar-lidar-robotaxi-california-china"&gt;Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399389/luminar-airbus-lidar-aviation-evtol-partnership"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18144506/audi-self-driving-car-volkswagen-luminar-lidar"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16373058/toyota-research-institute-self-driving-car-luminar"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is planning a new $400 million factory in Ohio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A runner trains on the Peloton Tread." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W0l8rUhF3RAbS8rLfExbZR9nCNk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335093/akrales_190328_3240_0158.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zjp6Bh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/peloton-to-invest-400-million-on-first-us-production-facility-in-ohio.html"&gt;Peloton has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to invest $400 million in a US factory to produce its connected bikes and treadmills, located in Troy Township, Ohio — about half an hour south of Toledo. The facility, which is planned to be approximately a million square feet, is called the Peloton Output Park. Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/peloton-to-open-ohio-factory-in-2023-to-build-bikes-treadmills?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;hopes it will eventually lead to lower prices&lt;/a&gt; for its products, though its CEO John Foley admits that could take a few years to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBd6m5"&gt;Currently, Peloton mainly manufactures its fitness equipment in Taiwan, while many of its customers are in the US. This caused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;expensive shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year as the company ran into both &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/peloton-to-invest-400-million-on-first-us-production-facility-in-ohio.html"&gt;heightened demand&lt;/a&gt; and long shipping times resulting from the pandemic. The company’s factory announcement is also colored by the shadow of its safety struggles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423745/peloton-recall-timeline-tread-plus-john-foley"&gt;subsequent recall of its treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421329/peloton-api-bug-customer-data-exposed"&gt;potential data leak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XHNFtg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y58nqXNrFH4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BZYG4U"&gt;US-based manufacturing ventures are a reliable way for tech companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241646/apple-tim-cook-gave-the-first-mac-pro-to-trump"&gt;generate positive press&lt;/a&gt;, and they can sometimes struggle to live up to the hype. Recent examples include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;Foxconn’s infamous plant in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;“new” “Apple” factory&lt;/a&gt;, which then-president Donald Trump bragged about, that was neither new, nor operated by Apple. For its part, Peloton is promising 2,000 new jobs coming to a reasonably rural area, but the proof will be in the actual Pelotons rolling out from the Ohio factory, which the company says is planned for 2023. According to &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-pop-announcement"&gt;its announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the company is currently working with local and state partners to finalize plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="By8KD2"&gt;The Ohio factory may not be the first producing Peloton equipment in the US: the company purchased fitness equipment maker Precor late last year, which has factories in Washington and North Carolina. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;Peloton reportedly hopes&lt;/a&gt; to start building some equipment in those factories by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.6 now available with new Apple Podcasts subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ynrvr-lLBWkVE-FcWLjMfyREk2g=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334814/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFiP3s"&gt;Apple is releasing its latest iOS 14.6 update today, and it’s largely focused on audio improvements. This new OS update will allow Apple Music subscribers to enable lossless audio or Dolby Atmos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;once it’s available next month&lt;/a&gt;, and it also debuts Apple Podcasts subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnw8CA"&gt;Podcasts users can now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscribe to content&lt;/a&gt; in the app for extra perks like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. Apple is also improving the Podcasts app with the ability to mark all episodes as played, recover old episodes, and remove downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6cqHT"&gt;iOS 14.6 includes a number of other quality-of-life improvements. If you’re an AirTag owner, iOS 14.6 includes the option to add an email address as a contact method for when the item tracker is in lost mode. There’s also Apple Card Family sharing, with support for up to five people to share an Apple Card for purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8fYXO"&gt;As always, this latest version of iOS also includes some fixes and security improvements. Apple has fixed an issue with the Apple Watch not unlocking an iPhone correctly, problems with reminders as blank lines, call blocking extensions not appearing in settings, reduced iPhone performance during startup, and Bluetooth issues during calls.&lt;/p&gt;
