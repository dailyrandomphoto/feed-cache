    <title>Firefox gets a redesign with bigger, floatier tabs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIVBQ4Vz1zWZqIYYd4dvU-Ogr_s=/79x0:922x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373967/fx_firefox_new_tab_design_copy_1000x562.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of Firefox’s new floating tab design.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Firefox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3SPUt"&gt;Mozilla launched a redesign for Firefox on Tuesday, and one of the changes you might notice first is a whole new look for tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVMKfW"&gt;Firefox tabs are now bigger than they used to be, and the one that’s in focus will float &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; the toolbar near the top of the browser. In Chrome or Safari, by contrast, the tab that’s in focus looks like it is attached directly to the toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feIzYY"&gt;Here’s a screenshot I took to give you a better idea of what the new tabs look like.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ol8quSW5tdIYPjifqzge4cEwa84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552502/Screen_Shot_2021_06_01_at_9.39.36_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="26t5nz"&gt;And if you want an idea of just how much bigger the new tabs are in the new design, check out this screenshot a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer took comparing the new to the old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V2u7E7_cJZSN1RRlD51iOgyD5Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553122/Screen_Shot_2021_06_01_at_9.27.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Left: new Firefox. Right: old Firefox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DEwTgg"&gt;Mozilla says this new detached design was made to encourage people to move their tabs around. “We detached the tab from the browser to invite you to move, rearrange and pull out tabs into a new window to suit your flow, and organize them so they’re easier for you to find,” &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/modern-clean-new-firefox-clears-the-way-to-all-you-need-online/"&gt;Mozilla said in a blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77Qdgk"&gt;The new Firefox design has some other changes as well. Mozilla has cleaned up the toolbar to make it a little less cluttered, which you can see in the images above. I think it’s a nice improvement, though I wish the new tabs and toolbar didn’t take up more vertical space in this new design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdufM9"&gt;The updated browser also has more streamlined menus, which you can preview below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oufjoMa2_Rs20y2muxWDM6Tufq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552543/fx_firefox_menus_1000x562.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New menus in the updated Firefox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9D0rDb"&gt;You can get a tour of the updated Firefox — and yes, a look at the new, bigger tabs — in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czEGwcZSYyo"&gt;this video from Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get a refurbished set of Apple AirPods Pro for $155 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icssF2hsYNu57Gdsq7eFJwz7ASE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370897/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kg4sQS"&gt;If you’re hunting for a set of truly wireless earbuds that offer great sound quality, noise cancellation, water resistance, a comfy fit, and other handy features, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-pro-grade-a-refurbished-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished Apple AirPods Pro at Woot cost just $155&lt;/a&gt;. These originally sold for $249, but some retailers offer them new for around $200. This model is a “grade A” unit with “minimal cosmetic damage” at most, and with “like-new functionality.”  These are covered with a 90-day warranty through Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IZpMIr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10504234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8axf7a"&gt;One of the best leftover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/28/22453053/best-memorial-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-headphones"&gt;Memorial Day deals&lt;/a&gt; is on the 40mm GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 6. It’s for the model with a red-colored casing and sport band, and its price is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $329 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (originally $399). The bigger 44mm Apple Watch Series 6 in this colorway &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $359 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. No other colors are seeing this big of a price cut right now, so check out this deal if you want Apple’s latest wearable without paying full price, and if you’re in love with red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oyzvlG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8PZC"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;latest generation of Amazon’s Echo Dot smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; with a built-in LED display that tells the time and temperature is $15 off. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag one for $45&lt;/a&gt;. It has seen a discount every few weeks since it launched earlier in 2021, but it hasn’t gone much lower than this yet. We predict that it will likely be more affordable during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which might be on June 21st and 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tHxMG1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397064"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zZBKOs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 1st, 5:06PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Amazon sold through its stock of discounted Galaxy Buds Pro, and Woot cleared through its refurbished AirPods that were selling for $95. So, we’ve popped in a deal at Woot on refurbished AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon did the math and would actually prefer getting sued</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zz16v_34HGBq1E8XyTpWSzOOGJs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373842/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tI82Bq"&gt;Amazon has recently changed its terms of service to allow its customers to bring lawsuits against the company instead of having to go through an arbitration process. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-faced-75-000-arbitration-demands-now-it-says-fine-sue-us-11622547000"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company made the change after over 75,000 Echo users were organized to file individual arbitration cases, which would have left Amazon on the hook for millions of dollars in fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6rEjw"&gt;Unlike lawsuits, arbitration cases are handled by a third party instead of a judge or jury. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Fee_Schedule_2.pdf"&gt;American Arbitration Association’s rules&lt;/a&gt; (which Amazon was bound by in its old terms of service), the company involved is responsible for hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars in fees when a consumer brings a case against it — and those numbers add up quickly if a law firm is able to coordinate large numbers of consumers to bring complaints at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvDc5H"&gt;We’ve seen mass-arbitration happen before in attempts to pressure tech companies (often with the goal of having those companies drop the aforementioned arbitration clauses from their worker contracts). Both &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ubers-arbitration-policy-comes-back-to-bite-it-in-the-a-1830892372"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135474/doordash-workers-forced-arbitration-william-alsup"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; have faced thousands of disputes from their workers. As consumers and workers seem to be cluing in to the possibility of using arbitration clauses to their advantage, it actually seems like Amazon’s terms of service change may be more out of self interest: win or lose, a class action lawsuit is very likely to be less expensive for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU4lIE"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM"&gt;conditions of use page&lt;/a&gt; says it was last updated on May 3rd, 2021. As of May 1st, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210501194431/https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM"&gt;according to the WayBack Machine&lt;/a&gt;, the “Disputes” sub-section explained, at length, the process users would have to go through if they wanted to make a claim against the company. It also made clear Amazon’s responsibility to reimburse auditors fees for claims under $10,000, unless the claim was declared frivolous. Now, the disputes section reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VgH0Tk"&gt;Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Amazon Service will be adjudicated in the state or Federal courts in King County, Washington, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in these courts. We each waive any right to a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cYYfIf"&gt;The updated terms of service also removes the requirement that users agree to the Federal Arbitration Act in order to use any Amazon services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjWZbO"&gt;That last bit about waiving the right to a jury trial may be unusual for tech company ToS agreements, but as an alternative to arbitration, it’s certainly been tried in other industries — though &lt;a href="https://katten.com/files/21691_Huben--Shopping_Center_Legal--CA_Supreme_Court.pdf"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; have found such clauses &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109269232752592826"&gt;to be unenforceable&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmXddE"&gt;While Amazon’s customers may now no longer have to go through arbitration, &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/01/13/amazon-delivery-workers-ask-scotus-to-deny-attempt-to-overturn-ruling-invalidating-arbitration-agreements/?slreturn=20210501140812"&gt;some of its Flex workers&lt;/a&gt; are currently fighting for the ability to sue the company, despite their arbitration agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyJmT2"&gt;It’s also worth noting that certain consumer suits were able to bypass arbitration before the change — Amazon is currently being sued after allegations that some of its Alexas devices made audio recordings of minors. &lt;a href="https://www.kellerlenkner.com/9th-circ-wont-let-amazon-arbitrate-kids-alexa-privacy-suit/"&gt;Judges have ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the case did not have to be handled by arbitration, as the minors didn’t agree to the terms of service. However, Amazon’s change opens the gates for other suits to be handled in court as well, and it helps the company avoid expensive mass arbitrations in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rimac reveals the Nevera, a 1,900-horsepower electric hypercar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cMw12d07C93s2Qi-e3SCUi_GQIs=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373538/rimac_nevera_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rimac&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s3TEnp"&gt;The Rimac &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086808/rimac-concept-two-electric-hypercar-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;C_Two concept&lt;/a&gt; has evolved into a production-ready electric hypercar called the Nevera, and it’s still just as absurd as it was three years when it first broke cover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095430/rimac-concept-two-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEAif1"&gt;Powered by a 120kWh battery pack, the Nevera uses four electric motors — one for each wheel — to put down an almost unbelievable 1.4MW of power, which Rimac says is roughly equivalent to 1,914 horsepower. The quad-motor setup can push the car to 60 miles per hour from a standstill in just 1.85 seconds. It has a top speed of 258 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6C830U"&gt;What’s more, Rimac says one of the things it worked on over the last three years was improving the battery pack’s liquid cooling system, meaning drivers can use that peak power for longer before the batteries start to complain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mMbBBP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It costs a cool $2.4 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7qmtjw"&gt;To make sure drivers have a fighting chance at controlling that amount of power, Rimac developed a new all-wheel torque vectoring system that basically acts as both an electronic stability and traction control system. The software can make “over 100 calculations per second to tailor the level of torque to achieve the desired driving style,” Rimac says in the press release for the Nevera. Braking in a car like this is also important, and Rimac has designed the Nevera to be able to dynamically adjust the balance of the braking force between the friction brakes in the wheels and the regenerative braking made possible by the electric motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W4Fn2x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10528863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuyVM6"&gt;If that’s not enough, Rimac has developed an “AI driving coach” feature that leverages the Nevera’s 12 ultrasonic and six radar sensors, as well as 13 cameras to help “optimize and enhance the driver’s on-track performance.” It does this by providing track-specific audio and visual cues for when to brake for, where to turn into, and when to accelerate out of a corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZXkov"&gt;Of course, very few people will have to worry about whether they can properly pilot a Nevera. Rimac is only making 150 of them, and they’ll each start around $2.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWulER"&gt;A big part of that price tag is Nevera’s lavish tech. The monocoque is the largest single carbon fiber piece in the automotive industry, according to the company, dramatically cutting weight and improving safety. The H-shaped battery pack is structurally integrated into that monocoque, too, keeping the center of gravity low and adding to the overall structural stiffness. To keep the ride smooth, the Nevera has a double wishbone suspension that uses electronically controlled dampers, which also makes for easy ride height adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCfPao"&gt;Inside the cockpit, there are three screens: a driver display, a horizontal touchscreen in the center console, and a passenger display. There’s also an accompanying mobile app, which offers live track data, and the ability to download telemetry so drivers can analyze their performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vTP7N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nevera represents the culmination of a lot of ideas Rimac has worked on for a decade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Crs7N4"&gt;The other part of the price tag is that Rimac will customize basically every other aspect of the Nevera hypercar for buyers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vxg122"&gt;No two Neveras will leave the Rimac factory looking the same or bearing the same specification, thanks to customers’ ability to choose from a comprehensive range of bespoke trims and material options. In addition to the company’s premium individual personalization program, Rimac will offer its flagship in various editions: GT, Signature, Timeless or the customers can choose to go Bespoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wwKcUp"&gt;Each buyer will even be “invited to Croatia to design his or her car to their exacting requirements,” Rimac says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVusZv"&gt;As if that isn’t enough to convince someone to pony up $2 million and change, the company says founder Mate Rimac will personally test each Nevera that gets built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuiewQ"&gt;The funny thing about a car like the Nevera is that it’s not alone. There is a growing stable of absurdly priced electric hypercars that can make nearly 2,000 horsepower. Lotus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696638/lotus-evija-hypercar-specs-price-photos"&gt;has the Evija&lt;/a&gt;, while Pininfarina &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251972/pininfarina-battista-1900-horsepower-faster-electric-vehicle-car-ev-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;has the Battista&lt;/a&gt;. (There are a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167951/koenigsegg-gemera-hybrid-photos-specs-geneva-motor-show-2020"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395743/hongqi-s9-silk-faw-belt-road-auto-shanghai-2021"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; in this class, too.) What’s made Rimac unique is that it really was a sort of go-it-alone effort, one that Mate Rimac built from the ground up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGJjRH"&gt;That said, Mate Rimac says in the press release for the Nevera that it “is the car I had in mind when I embarked on the ‘impossible’ journey ten years ago.” His company now has &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/company/porsche-increases-stake-rimac-automobili-24-per-cent-23825.html"&gt;backing from Porsche&lt;/a&gt;, which is reportedly working with Rimac to make electric hypercars for the German automaker’s sibling brand, Bugatti. Hyundai has also &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-rimac-investment-partnership-performance-ev/"&gt;tossed Rimac some coin&lt;/a&gt;. While the Nevera looks like a truly thrilling electric hypercar, the most exciting thing about what Rimac’s been doing for the last decade might be whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSBXZc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s largest meat supplier grinds to a halt after cyberattack </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="JBS USA Pork Processing Plant As Meat-Pricing Probe Expands" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1BWnAE8kfNBbnXMyDKxTG-ouSs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373432/1219305308.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HyAb0v"&gt;JBS, a Brazilian company which supplies a fifth of the world’s meat, was the victim of a coordinated cyberattack, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-31/meat-is-latest-cyber-victim-as-hackers-hit-top-supplier-jbs?sref=ZOgFhNqs"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za98FS"&gt;Details are still emerging about the extent and severity of the attack — which became apparent to JBS on May 30th, and was disclosed to staff in a memo on the 31st — but it has caused some of the largest slaughterhouses in the US to shut down already, and &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/meatpacking-hack-jbs-ransomware-australia/"&gt;at least one&lt;/a&gt; in Canada. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, JBS has suspended its own IT systems in Australia and North America, though the company’s backup servers appear to be unaffected. Naturally, the shutdowns of computer systems and physical plants are likely to cause supply delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKL9Wj"&gt;In a press conference earlier today, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the attack as coming “from a criminal organization likely based in Russia.” JBS has yet to disclose whether the attack involved ransomware, although the broad shutdowns are consistent with the effects of a ransomware attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLi7qJ"&gt;This marks yet another high-profile piece of infrastructure targeted by Russian hacking groups, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;the attack on Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; last month. JBS is not based in the US, but because of its outsized role in meat supply, the attack has the potential to disrupt global availability of beef and pork if not resolved quickly. As such, the White House has offered support to the company and “is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter, and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals,” Jean-Pierre told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to opt out of (or into) Amazon’s Sidewalk network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3qZWy9qI2FAu0Zua6SZjatjLyR8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373399/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QToc8K"&gt;Do you own an Echo Studio, an Echo Dot, or a Ring Floodlight Cam? If so, Amazon is about to introduce your device to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;a new type of network it calls Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to help extend the range of its low-bandwidth devices (so that if your network goes down, for example, your Dot can piggyback on your neighbors’), and also to make location devices such as Tile more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6Nqu5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-sidewalk-a-new-way-to-stay-connected"&gt;According to Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Sidewalk will use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the 900MHz spectrum, and other frequencies “to simplify new device setup, extend the low-bandwidth working range of devices, and help devices stay online and up-to-date even if they are outside the range of home Wi-Fi.” It will do this by essentially sharing the connectivity of your compatible devices with that of your neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0snNGQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/echo-tile-and-level-devices-join-amazon-sidewalk"&gt;Amazon says that&lt;/a&gt; Sidewalk will get switched on this coming June 8th (Tile functionality will be enabled June 14th), and that it plans to automatically opt in all the eligible devices. The company’s published &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Sidewalk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21328123011"&gt;list of devices&lt;/a&gt; includes: Ring Floodlight Cam (2019), Ring Spotlight Cam Wired (2019), Ring Spotlight Cam Mount (2019), Echo (third gen and newer), Echo Dot (third gen and newer), Echo Dot for Kids (third gen and newer), Echo Dot with Clock (third gen and newer), Echo Plus (all generations), Echo Show (all models and generations), Echo Spot, Echo Studio, Echo Input, Echo Flex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVsh1L"&gt;Questions have been raised as to how this could impact the privacy of your data. &lt;a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/sidewalk/final_privacy_security_whitepaper.pdf"&gt;Amazon has made a white paper available&lt;/a&gt; that lays out how customer information is being protected. But if you are still not reassured by this and would rather not participate in Amazon’s good neighbor program — as it were — you can opt out before Sidewalk gets switched on. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i0zKeR"&gt;Using the Alexa app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THgMF0"&gt;In your Amazon Alexa app, select the “More” icon at the lower right hand corner of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8DuPji"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Account Setting” &amp;gt; “Amazon Sidewalk.” (Just a note: if you’re not connected to any Echo or Ring devices, you will probably not see this option.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lyxIMA"&gt;Use the toggle to disable Sidewalk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s easy to toggle Sidewalk off or on" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XBLN4eB_lRoVjRX-0WTFig1grI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552821/Screenshot_20210601_131401.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s easy to toggle Sidewalk off or on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also choose to just toggle Community Finding off" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AH5K-v3n80pzIw6l3CKkKYaDmdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552823/Screenshot_20210601_143801.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also choose to just toggle Community Finding off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OujlbQ"&gt;And that’s it! Opting out will not (according to Amazon) in any way affect the current function of your devices. But if you decide you do want to opt back in, or you want to opt out sometime in the future, you can come back to the “Amazon Sidewalk” page and use the toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2ECJP"&gt;Note that in the same page you’ll see a setting for “Community Finding,” which will share the approximate location of the devices connected by Sidewalk in order to make location-dependent items like Tile more accurate. If you want, you can leave Sidewalk active but disable “Community Finding” by selecting the “Community Finding” link at the bottom of the “Amazon Sidewalk” page and then toggling it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jBTuab"&gt;Using the Ring app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cZdG5Z"&gt;In your Ring app, go into your Control Center by tapping the the three-lined icon in the upper left-hand corner of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7eETzv"&gt;Select “Sidewalk” and use the slide button to opt out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jkkfse"&gt;You’ll be ask to confirm your opt-out. You can opt back in the same way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your Ring app, go to the Control Center" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J1tad0IWqHEjU2xIAuSb7hqzM4I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553207/Image_from_iOS__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your Ring app, go to the Control Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle Sidewalk off or on" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Obk5X1AMWhtvImq8VTO15b3Yy3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553208/Image_from_iOS__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle Sidewalk off or on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RJPHLb"&gt;One note: A reader wrote to say that, although she had opted out via the Alexa app, when the feature came to the Ring app, she found she had been opted back in again. So if you have both apps — or even if you don’t — you may want to check later to make sure your opt-out has stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct1iV3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 1st, 2021, 5:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a section on the Ring app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft mistake suggests PS5 or Nintendo Switch may support more Dolby tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpp22pH9-NdUKCbnIEpaVhHWNZQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373305/vpavic_201103_4275_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9XqxU"&gt;On Monday, Microsoft published a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/fr-fr/2021/05/31/decouvrez-dolby-vision-et-dolby-atmos/"&gt;now-deleted blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Xbox Wire France that claimed Dolby Vision and Atmos will be Xbox console exclusives for two years. (You can read &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:z42kKLEFz88J:https://news.xbox.com/fr-fr/2021/05/31/decouvrez-dolby-vision-et-dolby-atmos/+&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=au"&gt;a cached version of the blog here&lt;/a&gt;.) On Tuesday, however, Microsoft said the post had inaccurate information and that there actually &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; an exclusivity deal in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONDNit"&gt;“A blog post was mistakenly published by a local Xbox team that included inaccurate information regarding exclusivity of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision on Xbox Series X|S,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There is no exclusivity agreement of either tech on Xbox. We are proud to partner with Dolby to offer Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision to gamers on Xbox and will have more to share about the general availability of Dolby Vision on Xbox Series X|S soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxc18w"&gt;Microsoft’s statement is carefully worded in such a way that suggests, without confirming, that rival platforms like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch could get the advanced surround sound and HDR tech in the future. Technically, the PS5 &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; supports Dolby Atmos, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/#3daudio"&gt;but just for Blu-ray movies&lt;/a&gt;. While Nintendo has traditionally only offered limited support for surround sound or advanced display output, the company’s expected to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;an upgraded “Switch Pro”&lt;/a&gt; as soon as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456160/new-nintendo-switch-release-date-september-e3-announcement"&gt;this September&lt;/a&gt;, where Dolby’s tech might be a better fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9U7dkh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What we actually want from an upgraded Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wzLzNM"&gt;The Xbox Series X and S already support Dolby Atmos, and support for Dolby Vision could roll out broadly soon — Microsoft began testing of Dolby Vision on the Xbox Series X and S with testers in the Xbox Insider “alpha ring” group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435864/microsoft-dolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-test"&gt;in mid-May&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft also offered Dolby Vision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563670/microsoft-xbox-one-dolby-vision-support"&gt;on its Xbox One S and One X consoles&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t really used for games; Dolby has advertised since September 2020 that the Xbox Series X and Series S would be the first consoles to support both while gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAnCCS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s serious injury rate at warehouses was still nearly double the rest of the industry in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TrKNpqbz7XXwowugil0JHTFQI1A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69372762/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YMjgSl"&gt;Amazon’s serious injury rate at its warehouses was nearly twice as high as the rest of the industry in 2020, newly released Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) data shows in reports from both &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/01/amazon-osha-injury-rate/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=wp_business-technology"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://thesoc.org/amazon-primed-for-pain/"&gt;Strategic Organizing Center&lt;/a&gt; (a collection of unions that represent over 4 million workers around the country). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H0l9p"&gt;According to both groups’ analyses of the OSHA data, which spans 2017 through 2020, Amazon workers suffered 5.9 “serious” injuries — defined as incidents where workers received time off or a change in work responsibilities while recovering — per 200,000 hours worked (a metric that encompasses 100 workers working full time for the year). That’s compared to 3.3 injuries for that same metric across the rest of the warehousing industry. Walmart, one of Amazon’s largest retail competitors, had a rate of 2.5 serious injuries per 200,000 hours, more than half of Amazon’s rate of serious injury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRfUiv"&gt;On the one hand, the new data represents an improvement from 2019, when a report from &lt;a href="https://revealnews.org/article/how-amazon-hid-its-safety-crisis/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reveal &lt;/em&gt;from the Center for Investigative Reporting&lt;/a&gt; showed that Amazon had an overall rate of 7.7 serious injuries per 100 employees. And that lower rate is despite the surge in overall Amazon shipping in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a potentially promising trend to see. In fact, the 5.9 serious injuries per 100 employee rate — while still nearly twice as high as the rest of the industry — is actually Amazon’s best year in some time, considering that &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reveal&lt;/em&gt; noted that the company had markedly higher overall injury rates in 2017, 2018, and 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXuiEW"&gt;In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel commented that “while any incident is one too many, we are continuously learning and seeing improvements through ergonomics programs, guided exercises at employees’ workstations, mechanical assistance equipment, workstation setup and design, and forklift telematics and guardrails—to name a few.” Nantel also noted that Amazon invested over $1 billion in new safety measures last year, while expanding its health and safety team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVy5mB"&gt;But it’s particularly telling that even at its lowest serious injury rate in years, Amazon’s warehouses still have a dramatically higher injury rate than the rest of the industry. As one Amazon worker complained to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, the company set “unrealistic expectations” in pushing workers to meet productivity rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojZBjv"&gt;Last fall, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21494381/amazon-rising-injury-rates-reveal-report"&gt;contested the original report&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Reveal&lt;/em&gt;, arguing that the interpretation of the OSHA data used to classify a “serious” injury — which, in the various reports here, is defined as those that require time off or work reassignments — is skewed by what the company claims is more generous recovery time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax5iYc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google union pushes company to drop deadnames from ID badges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fi99nO1Se4c3Kjt44NdIgVKnnRI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69372657/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AsNB2z"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union &lt;a href="https://dropthedeadnames.org/#petition"&gt;launched a campaign&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday to push Google to allow employees to use their chosen names on ID badges. The move comes after Phares Lee, a transgender man who works at a Google data center in South Carolina and is employed by security subcontracting firm G4S, asked to have his deadname removed from his badge and was denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Kbjs"&gt;Lee came out as transgender during his initial interview with G4S. “I was assured [Google] was inclusive, yet when I asked about a badge in my preferred name I was told that my badge had to reflect my legal name,” he says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “After arriving on site and being issued the badge with my dead name, I noticed there were many people on site, both cis and transgender, whose badges did not reflect their legal names.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqJxdI"&gt;Lee’s experience reflects a growing sentiment within Google’s contract workforce, that TVCs (temporary, vendor, and contract employees) &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;do not have the same rights and benefits as full-time Google staff&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAt5hL"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;Google ended a long-time policy&lt;/a&gt; that forced employees to settle workplace disputes in private arbitration with the company. Yet the change did not extend to Google’s third-party contractors. “Contracting companies, like G4S, are allowed to make rules for their employees that directly contradict [Google’s] commitment to inclusion,” Lee explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGCatR"&gt;Lee says that when he arrived at the data center, he was the only transgender security officer on site. In an attempt to connect with other LGBTQ individuals, he tried to join one of Google’s employee resource groups, which are designed for underrepresented communities. He says G4S management told him these groups were a “privilege” to which contractors were not entitled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY3bAq"&gt;Now, the Alphabet Workers Union is circulating a petition asking Google and G4S to adopt a chosen name policy for TVCs and full-time staff. The policy should ensure “publicly displayed names reflect a chosen name where it differs from their legal name; allows pronoun stickers to be displayed on name badges, and protects the right to privacy of dead names,” according to the letter. The union also wants Google and G4S to allow contractors to participate in employee resource groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSbXzu"&gt;The petition currently has 165 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QVGFEg"&gt;Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia, and it’s &lt;a href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2021/Discovery-Inc.-Announces-Warner-Bros.-Discovery-As-New-Name-For-Proposed-Leading-Global-Entertainment-Company/default.aspx"&gt;now announced&lt;/a&gt; a new name for the combined company: Warner Bros. Discovery. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/warner-bros-discovery-will-be-name-of-media-colossus-formed-in-merger-11622567102"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the name was first revealed during a staff meeting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPlaCJ"&gt;The merger was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T said it would spin off WarnerMedia — the entertainment giant containing Warner Bros., HBO, DC Comics, and CNN, among many others — and that Discovery would take over the new company. But they didn’t have a new name prepared on the day the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VT6VKq"&gt;Discovery CEO David Zaslav will be in charge of the merged group. WarnerMedia is by far the bigger company, though, with around three times the 2020 revenue and a roster of iconic characters and properties. Discovery brings to the table a huge archive of reality TV shows and a growing news and sports business in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9w3TS"&gt;“We believe it will be the best and most exciting place in the world to tell big, important and impactful stories across any genre – and across any platform: film, television and streaming,” Zaslav said in a statement today. The combined company is borrowing a line from the Warner Bros. classic &lt;em&gt;The Maltese Falcon &lt;/em&gt;for its slogan, “The stuff that dreams are made of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8Nb5e"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery expect the merger to wrap up in mid-2022, assuming it clears regulatory hurdles. AT&amp;amp;T shareholders will own 71 percent of the new company, so it’s really more like WarnerMedia is being freed from AT&amp;amp;T and picking up Discovery along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dliZyY"&gt;The hope is that the combined entertainment giant can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;become an even bigger player in streaming&lt;/a&gt; than the two are independently today. WarnerMedia runs HBO Max, which has been fairly successful so far, though it remains smaller than Netflix and Disney Plus. Discovery only recently launched Discovery Plus. Zaslav has said the combined company will put $20 billion per year toward new content, a number rivaling Netflix and exceeding Disney Plus, and that he hopes to eventually reach 400 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKDvCp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction June 1st, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The deal is expected to close in mid-2022, not in mid-2020 as this article initially misstated, which would require a time machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
