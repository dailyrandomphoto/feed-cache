    <title>DJI Mini 2 review: tiny dancer</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It looks the same, but it flies and shoots much better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BzHVcC"&gt;When the first Mavic Mini was introduced, it was clearly created with one purpose: make a drone with an adequate camera that weighs under 250 grams. That number is the key spec because anything under it still doesn’t require FAA registration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGiDYF"&gt;The new DJI Mini 2 hits that same sub-250g target but with fewer compromises than the first Mini. Where the original was mostly targeting people who were thinking about making that first step into the drone world, the DJI Mini 2 aims to satisfy not only beginners but also experienced drone pilots, photographers, and videographers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LUzkG"&gt;As someone who spends a lot of his free time traversing the city with a camera, taking photos, I usually end up carrying more gear than I really need. It can become a tough call deciding if it’s worth bringing my drone with me. When it is, I usually grab my DJI Mavic 2 Pro. It is still a very portable drone, but paired with two extra batteries and a controller, it becomes a little hard to carry for hours on end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tromZy"&gt;This is where the $450 DJI Mini 2 comes in. It’s light — in fact, it’s tiny. And though it obviously has a worse camera than DJI’s bigger drones, it’s still a very good camera. I underestimated the Mini 2 at first, but I soon discovered a ton of little improvements that make this new $449 drone a perfect package for a content creator on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k0hMVT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10336942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKDfTeCYFX7bh8p7nDfIYszzAfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296016/vpavic_201214_4405_0361.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="19aDoz"&gt;Flying the DJI Mini 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="opeIoA"&gt;The DJI Mini 2 is the exact same size and weight as its predecessor so it won’t require registration with the FAA. And according to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;newly updated drone laws&lt;/a&gt;, sub-250g drones won’t be subjected to broadcasting the pilot’s and drone’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5RRw0"&gt;The Mini 2 also comes with a new larger controller. The same controller that was introduced with the Mavic Air 2. The phone now sits on top of the controller and it’s way easier to use. Unlike before, you don’t have to be worried if you have a case on your phone, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYrdx9"&gt;Besides the improved camera, the most notable new addition on the DJI Mini 2 is Ocusync. It provides a solid and reliable link compared to the old Wi-Fi connection on the original Mini. Ocusync operates on radio frequencies and already proved its worth in other DJI drones — it’s low latency, can transmit 1080p or 720p video previews to your phone, and in ideal conditions can provide ridiculous range. It is single-handedly the biggest upgrade between the original Mavic Mini and the Mini 2, and it makes flying this drone so much easier and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="0X8y7e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10336946"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="57aLoD"&gt;Another thing that makes it more enjoyable to fly are the stronger motors. It makes the drone able to sustain high winds on par with some of the more powerful DJI drones, like the Mavic 2 Pro and Zoom. At no point during my testing was I ever worried about losing control. Also, smaller drones are just way more fun to fly, and this one actually doesn’t sound too loud. Smaller drones tend to have a very high-pitched noise, but you don’t get that with the Mini 2 until you fly it in speedy sport mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aVaVg"&gt;What you won’t find on this drone are obstacle avoidance sensors, so you do need to be very careful about how you fly it. But despite not having any sensors, I actually felt more adventurous with the Mini — it is so small you can easily squeeze it through tighter spaces. I found myself trying things that I normally wouldn’t try with a heavier and more expensive drone. The downside of not having any sensors is that it also means you won’t find a lot of the automated, preprogrammed flight modes. The autonomous Active track mode isn’t here, nor can you create hyperlapses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW9VjX"&gt;In order to fly the Mini 2, you’ll have to use DJI’s Fly app; it’s basically a stripped-down version of the DJI Fly 4 app intended for more advanced drones. It has all the essential features that you need — including gimbal calibration, which I’m only pointing out because I had to use it more than once. Without calibrating every few flights, the horizon would look slanted, which I found annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01U7nD"&gt;Also, this is minor, but it’s something I really appreciated: the app doesn’t auto-pause your music or podcasts, so you can keep listening to your jams while flying. I don’t know why that isn’t the case on other apps, but it’s been bothering me for so long now and I’m glad DJI addressed it here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYDZqpFZzR8J87XDeBfhZ3x_-ak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296014/vpavic_201118_4405_0353.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KIpIDhw6WiZMvdgAtPDiZ24kW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296003/vpavic_201118_4405_0295.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOSEop"&gt;I’m also a big fan of the charging hub, which you can buy separately for an additional $39. It fits up to three batteries and charges them one by one, starting with the least-drained battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6XluL"&gt;Usually when I bring my Mavic 2 Pro hiking or traveling, I rely on about three batteries per day of filming. And I try really hard to maximize all of those batteries by carefully planning my flights because chances are I won’t find a wall outlet to top them off, nor do I have the optional $80 car charger. The charging hub, which was available for the original Mavic Mini, also has a USB-C port. That means you can easily power it with an external battery pack in your backpack and have it charge your drone’s batteries as you move from one location to another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qenXHviXS2l0zWP08eMLL2aSv34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296006/vpavic_201118_4405_0307.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wvLeDq"&gt;Photos on the DJI Mini 2 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Aend4W"&gt;The camera still has the same, small 1/2.3-inch 12MP sensor as the original Mini, but it produces much nicer photos than before. JPGs that you get right off the drone are fantastic, and you can “enhance” them within the DJI app. It applies some subtle adjustments to the overall contrast of the image, lifts shadows, and adds a bit of life to overall colors. I appreciate how subtle and effective these adjustments are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2r1daB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10337191"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIfPBh"&gt;Photos look sharp and they hold a good level of detail and contrast up to 1600 ISO. Above that, things starts breaking down a bit. Images start looking muddy and lose definition and color. You’ll rarely shoot past that number anyway, and I think that everything up to 800 ISO actually looks very good. The noise handling has been getting better on all DJI drones and the Mini 2 is no exception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT35Xk"&gt;Most drone pilots are looking to capture stunning landscapes or cityscapes with a clean, punchy, and vibrant look. And the downside of smaller sensors is that they make noise more pronounced. One extra benefit from more powerful motors is that the drone is more stable in the air, so you could allow yourself to slow down your shutter speed and lower the ISO for even better results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eUJ6Q_AePnTI7X5HBBsdolFGlJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296500/vpavic_Mini_2_20210211_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ucjh9"&gt;One thing you should keep in mind is where you want to show your photos and in which format and size. Personally, I probably wouldn’t make large prints out of most of these photos, but I’d post almost all of them on my Instagram grid. And if you’re still not satisfied with the JPGs, you can always edit the RAW files separately and see how far you can push it in post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1NdDkk"&gt;But in my past few weeks with the Mini 2, I rarely even bothered with doing a lot of post-processing of my RAWs. I am usually very happy with what I get directly from the drone and can apply minor edits myself if needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WBhsM"&gt;It’s also part of the reason why this is a perfect drone for almost everyone. Usually when I take out the Mavic 2 Pro, I worry about ND filters, polarizers, and I try to keep the aperture at that sharpest f/5,6 – f/8 range. But with the Mini 2, my approach changes entirely. It’s almost like going from a fully manual SLR to a point-and-shoot camera. I basically just leave everything on auto without being too precious about the technical side of things, trusting that everything I get will actually be quite good. It’s a nice change of pace to my overall approach that I wasn’t expecting when I started my review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GCeXxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10337197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FUrJ0Z"&gt;Video on the DJI Mini 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6rqLxW"&gt;Even though the sensor is unchanged, it is now capable of shooting 4K video at 100 Mbps bitrate up to 30fps compared to 2.7K at 60 Mbps that was on the original Mavic Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckTLQ1"&gt;The footage looks surprisingly good for a sensor of this size. Daylight footage looks crisp throughout and the color doesn’t look overly processed. There’s enough information there for you to do minor color edits in post production if you really want to, but most people will be happy with videos straight out of the camera. Unfortunately, you won’t find a dedicated cinelike color profile, which would have provided a little bit more control over the coloring process and extended the dynamic range. For someone like me who likes to manipulate color in the edit, this is a big downside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="b2Ot7s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are no color profiles, but footage straight from the camera is solid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6c8UMYE_xtrHiudAjwLh9ZxGKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296011/vpavic_201118_4405_0348.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bij_Wwh2kdJB3okOiraNxtJkI8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296012/vpavic_201118_4405_0349.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LLMhqS"&gt;DJI does have a decent track record of bringing useful software updates to its products. The first Mavic Mini received a massive upgrade last year which enabled things like the cinelike profile and added the ability to take RAW photos in addition to JPG. I hope DJI keeps adding more features to this drone, too, but as always you shouldn’t buy hardware today based on the hope of a software update in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxInVJ"&gt;Similarly to what I said about photos, the smaller sensor really shows its limitations at higher ISO numbers, but I wouldn’t let that discourage you. The footage still looks good even at low light. The blacks and shadows hold up very well and the overall image still looks rich. There is visible noise in the shadows, but my advice is to lean into those shadows, make them darker and a lot of that noise will get removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeDKnU"&gt;There is one more downside to this camera and that is the lack of support for ND filters. I’ve seen some third-party options online, but the camera isn’t designed for them. On rare occasions some video clips did look choppy due to very fast shutter speeds, but for the most part it has been surprisingly tolerable. The lack of ND filters speaks more to who DJI had in mind as a potential consumer. Most people don’t go through the hassle of learning about and using ND filters, but I wish it was an option for the few of us who do invest more time in the filming process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjbIgh"&gt;Lastly, this drone also has a 2x zoom. DJI calls it lossless, but that’s a bit generous. It looks fine on smaller screens, but once you start editing your footage, you’ll immediately notice its drawbacks. Pixels become larger and footage loses its sharpness. It doesn’t look any different than cropping the original footage. It’s a nice little bonus feature which could work in a pinch, but I wouldn’t rely on it too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JCYgwppJO16OvlZWfbGQ5dK55gA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22296009/vpavic_201118_4405_0339.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eKfcJP"&gt;The Mini 2 isn’t DJI’s flashiest drone. In fact, it is almost the opposite. It proved to me how many flagship drone features I actually don’t miss when they’re gone. The Mini 2 is a culmination of some of the best things DJI can offer inside a minuscule package, starting with an always reliable and steady connection, more than adequate camera, and a great software experience. This drone strikes a near perfect balance between price, mobility, and image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCUEZg"&gt;But as a creator, image quality is really important to me. And as much as I praised the improvements here, you still have to be aware of the limitations of smaller sensors when it comes to noise-to-pixel density ratio, low light performance, and dynamic range. Ninety percent of the time this drone was great for what I needed it to do, but there were times I wished I had a slightly better camera on me with higher megapixel count, a bigger sensor, or wider dynamic range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFitV0"&gt;All those image quality specs really do matter — but so does the DJI Mini 2’s size. It’s a drone that I never hesitate to toss in my camera bag. The old saying that the best camera is the one you have with you is just as true when that camera is attached to a drone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo and Cruise dominated autonomous testing in California in the first year of the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fa2I_i208ZTscMz6Nmbg6azs-es=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803589/Image_from_iOS__9_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4ERkN"&gt;Unsurprisingly, there was much less autonomous vehicle testing in California in 2020 compared to years prior. The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21183421/self-driving-cars-coronavirus-covid19-human-drivers-waymo-cruise-zoox"&gt;forced many AVs off the road&lt;/a&gt; in the early part of the year. But companies licensed to operate AVs on public roads in California still logged nearly 2 million miles of testing, with two of the top operators, Waymo and Cruise, comprising the bulk of those miles thanks to what some safety drivers allege was a lax attitude toward safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMlncs"&gt;Autonomous vehicles registered in California traveled approximately 1.99 million miles in autonomous mode on public roads in 2020, a decrease of about 800,000 miles from the previous year, according to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. These mileage figures were reported as part of &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/"&gt;the state’s annual “disengagement reports,”&lt;/a&gt; which all licensed operators are required to submit. In addition to the miles driven, the reports list the frequency at which human safety drivers were forced to take control of their autonomous vehicles (also known as a “disengagement”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HJdSIS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a decrease of about 800,000 miles from the previous year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fARZc7"&gt;The disengagement reports are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"&gt;widely disparaged&lt;/a&gt; as being, at best, meaningless and, at worse, misleading. Companies have a lot of discretion about when to disengage, the testing environments aren’t uniform, and it’s difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison between companies. Media outlets tend to overhype the numbers in service of a false “race” narrative in which certain companies are outpacing others in miles driven and disengagements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qm2Vyp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everyone hates California’s self-driving car reports","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21142685/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zpdHsF"&gt;But this year, the reports can still serve as a time capsule of a year upended by the coronavirus pandemic. Waymo, for example, generally considered to be the leading autonomous vehicle operator in the world, only drove 628,838 miles, a 56-percent decrease compared to the 1.45 million miles it drove in 2019. That decrease is notable considering Waymo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20680938/waymo-self-driving-cars-passengers-permit-california-pick-up"&gt;recently approved to begin accepting passengers&lt;/a&gt; in its vehicles in preparation for the inevitable launch of a robotaxi service in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9o2Qwv"&gt;Waymo only reported 21 disengagements over the course of the year, or a rate of 0.033 disengagements per 1,000 miles. That’s an improvement over the company’s rate of 0.076 per 1,000 self-driven miles in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0BiVo"&gt;Cruise, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors and Waymo’s main rival, is also prepping to launch a similar service in the state. And interestingly enough, its mileage number remained more or less the same last year as compared to 2019. The company reported driving 770,049 miles, a 7-percent decrease over 2019. It logged 26 disengagements during the year for a rate of 0.033 per 1,000 miles, improving on its 2019 rate of 0.082. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G38k7p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The total miles driven by Waymo and Cruise, 1.39 million, is 70 percent of the total autonomous miles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H0YOQI"&gt;The total miles driven by Waymo and Cruise, 1.39 million, is 70 percent of the total autonomous miles driven in California in 2020. Both companies briefly grounded their vehicles in the early months of the pandemic, but Cruise was back on the road by late April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286301/cruise-self-driving-car-testing-san-francisco-stay-home-order"&gt;using deliveries to local food banks as a pretext&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21275441/waymo-self-driving-car-delivery-bay-area-resume-covid"&gt;Waymo followed suit&lt;/a&gt;, resuming limited operations in June delivering packages for two Bay Area nonprofits. Over the summer, as COVID-19 cases in California were peaking, both companies resumed regular operations. Only when the air quality became very poor during the summer’s historic wildfires did Waymo and Cruise pull their vehicles from the road — and only briefly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ju5I9w"&gt;This was a worrisome decision for many of the companies’ backup drivers. Waymo and Cruise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123049/waymo-self-driving-cars-workers-vendor-contracts-benefits-needles"&gt;contract the labor of thousands of operational staff&lt;/a&gt; in the Bay Area, including backup drivers, mechanics, cleaners, and fleet managers. Backup drivers, in particular, play a crucial role: they monitor the driving operations of the self-driving car and occasionally take control when something goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D04xOf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Waymo and Cruise safety drivers face a bleak choice: pandemic or pollution?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21473719/waymo-cruise-self-driving-car-backup-safety-driver-pandemic-wildfires-california"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vKweI5"&gt;Some backup drivers were glad to be back at work. But others raised concerns about being stuck in a vehicle for hours a day with another person without the ability to socially distance. They chafed at being asked to come back to work while the salaried employees in the engineering and software divisions of these companies got to continue to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJXN1u"&gt;Waymo and Cruise both insist that safety, including the safety of their contract workers, is a top concern. But several drivers have accused the companies of exploiting loopholes to get cars back on the road in defiance of local public health orders. Cruise, in particular, was criticized for deploying non-delivery vehicles despite public health orders banning regular autonomous vehicle testing. Cruise said the extra vehicles were needed for R&amp;amp;D support for the delivery operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2mzST"&gt;Waymo and Cruise weren’t alone in racking up big mileage numbers during the pandemic. Pony.ai, a self-driving startup based in Silicon Valley and Guangzhou, China, reported driving 225,496 miles in autonomous mode. And Zoox, an autonomous vehicle company recently acquired by Amazon, drove 102,521 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXKGWv"&gt;Apple, which has been working on its own secretive car project for years, reported driving 18,805 miles, more than doubling its mileage in 2019. The tech giant also reported 130 disengagements, up from 64 the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Controversial shooter Six Days in Fallujah back in development</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Highwire Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezkuGi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt;, a controversial third-person shooter set during the Iraq War, is &lt;a href="https://www.sixdays.com/news"&gt;back in development&lt;/a&gt; over a decade after being canceled following negative feedback and controversy surrounding the game’s premise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLAmIf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stories/six-days-in-fallujah-announced-127714.phtml"&gt;Originally announced in 2009&lt;/a&gt; for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt; is a tactical shooter set during the Second Battle of Fallujah. The game’s original developer — a now-defunct studio called Atomic Games — said it was working with real US soldiers in order to create a more authentic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9Np91"&gt;Following the initial announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/konamis-fallujah-game-under-fire_8"&gt;several groups&lt;/a&gt; spoke out, criticizing the game’s concept. The negative reception eventually led Konami, the original publisher, to announce it would &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114311/Konami_Drops_Controversial_Six_Days_in_Fallujah.php"&gt;no longer publish it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="033Nhn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Six Days in Fallujah’ is slated to launch in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="efvsmd"&gt;The new developer tasked with creating the game is &lt;a href="https://highwiregames.com/"&gt;Highwire Games&lt;/a&gt;, a company co-founded by three people, most notably Jaime Griesemer and Marty O’Donnell. Griesemer previously served as a game designer at Bungie and Sucker Punch Productions, working on the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Infamous&lt;/em&gt; franchises. O’Donnell also worked at Bungie and is known for co-composing music for several &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; titles and the first &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEGTl1"&gt;To ensure this is the “most authentic military shooter to date,” Highwire Games &lt;a href="https://www.sixdays.com/news"&gt;announced on the official &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt; website&lt;/a&gt; that the development team has spoken with “over 100 Marines, Soldiers, and Iraqi civilians who were present during the Second Battle for Fallujah,” who have shared personal stories, photographs, and video recordings with the developer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ua2Jmz"&gt;Victura, a company former Bungie vice president Pete Tamte founded, will serve as the game’s publisher. Tamte was &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/atomic-ceo-defends-six-days-in-fallujah"&gt;previously the CEO of Atomic Games&lt;/a&gt;, where he was involved in the original development period for &lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMQrWi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six Days in Fallujah&lt;/em&gt; is slated to launch in 2021 on PC; the game will also release on consoles, but Highwire Games has yet to announce which platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this timeline of how MacKenzie Scott is donating her Amazon wealth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mackenzie Scott and her ex-husband Jeff Bezos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMdiy9Lx9iXYLSKBCx9qKGQWMnE=/0x91:3921x2705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803404/978342030.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PECPb0"&gt;It’s no secret MacKenzie Scott has committed some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345440/mackenzie-scott-jeff-bezos-amazon-wealth-donation-philanthropy"&gt;stunning acts of philanthropy&lt;/a&gt; of late. She gave surprise gifts totaling $410 million to historically Black colleges and universities in December 2020 alone, adding to the nearly $6 billion she gave away last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMteYt"&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-bezos-scott-philanthropy/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; makes excellent use of a visual timeline to provide some perspective on just how much more generous Scott has been with her money compared to her ex-husband Jeff Bezos: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Fay60q"&gt;Since 	their divorce in 2019, she’s become one of the most consequential philanthropists of her generation. Scott, who now controls one-quarter of the former couple’s combined wealth of more than $250 billion, gave away almost $6 billion last year to working charities—organizations that do good on a daily basis, rather than just steward philanthropic money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="y6dAyP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; timeline shows how the pace of giving shifted after the couple divorced; prior to 2019, they made several million- and multimillion-dollar donations here and there. (I’m still chuckling at the image for the year 2014 when the Bezoses donated a total of $2.25 million to fund clinical food allergy research at Stanford University: a photo of peanuts. It works on two levels!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoXM13"&gt;The article also notes that Bezos and Scott tend to differ in&lt;em&gt; how&lt;/em&gt; they donate their money. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/875418348598603776"&gt;Bezos said in 2017&lt;/a&gt; he wanted to include “right now” donations among his mostly long-term philanthropic efforts since the bulk of his donations went to foundations. But Scott gave directly to charitable organizations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PqCbnJ"&gt;Chuck Collins, director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, notes that cash went directly to charities, rather than sitting in a foundation. “The money hit the street,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WTyKD2"&gt;Scott also won praise from philanthropy experts for the way she donated her money: without strings attached. Many donors of large amounts have specific instructions for how they want charities to use their funds. But Scott’s gifts in 2020 were unrestricted, indicating she trusted the people on the ground doing the work, and it gives lie to the idea that it’s “hard” to make billion-dollar donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYUYr2"&gt;Bezos is following in the footsteps of other famous billionaires who turned their focus toward philanthropy after retiring from the day-to-day of running a business. He’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down as Amazon CEO&lt;/a&gt; later this year and says he plans to focus on “other passions,” including the Bezos Earth Fund, the Day 1 Fund, and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhmRRd"&gt;If he needs some pointers on how to have a meaningful impact with his gigantic fortune, he could do a lot worse than to take a few tips from his ex. She seems to have a handle on how to do the most good as directly as possible. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-bezos-scott-philanthropy/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Go read this &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed look at how she’s done it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s best over-ear headphones are $150 off refurbished at eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkRbDKf1YWfUPUSa9jHVfWBxCGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803251/akrales_190716_3546_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YAv6bT"&gt;eBay is hosting a President’s Day sale specifically on refurbished products. One of the best offers we’ve spotted is for Bose’s over-ear Noise Canceling 700 Headphones. These normally sell for $380, but you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-Certified-Refurbished%252F153863412679%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3Dvergedeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F11%2F22278008%2Fbose-headphones-refurbished-deal-ebay-ring-fit-switch-magic-keyboard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a certified refurbished pair for just $224 (before tax)&lt;/a&gt; by putting in the code &lt;strong&gt;PREZDAY20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. This is an exciting deal because each color is currently available, and Bose is the seller here, so it has handled the refurbishment process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXgHL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-Certified-Refurbished%252F153863412679%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3Dvergedeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F11%2F22278008%2Fbose-headphones-refurbished-deal-ebay-ring-fit-switch-magic-keyboard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On the page&lt;/a&gt;, it says that each set of headphones is in “pristine, like-new condition” and that it’ll be “in new packaging with original and new accessories”. Also, if you live in the US, eBay automatically tacks on a two-year warranty through Allstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nNyr8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N41PE8"&gt;If you own an 11-inch iPad Pro or a fourth-generation iPad Air and want to grab a keyboard accessory for your tablet, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Magic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2nd-generation%2F984505060&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have discounted the price on Apple’s Magic Keyboard, bringing it down to its best-ever price of $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQATyg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MlieND"&gt;When it comes to getting in shape, you don’t need to spend a ton of money on expensive exercising equipment or even on a gym membership — just use (or buy) a Nintendo Switch and consider picking up &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;. This is an exercising RPG game that includes a Ring-Con Pilates ring and a Leg Strap. Usually $80, you can get the game for $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XV4NHHN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728851577196507064" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Ring-Fit-Adventure-Black%2F434503657&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s foldable Surface Duo price drops to $999, arrives in Europe next week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZcDeKL"&gt;Microsoft is dropping the price of its foldable Surface Duo device to $999, and launching it in Europe and Canada next week. The Surface Duo will be available in the UK, France, Germany, and Canada on February 18th. It’s the first time the dual-screen Surface Duo has been available outside the US, for both businesses and consumers. Priced from £1,349 in the UK, the Surface Duo will be available at the Microsoft Store in the UK and retailer Currys PC World. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4IaMQ"&gt;The Surface Duo is also launching in Canada, France, and Germany on February 18th. The device will be priced at 1,549 euros in Germany. Microsoft first launched the Surface Duo in the US in September 2020, and it has taken the company around five months to complete an international release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ePn1AN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsurface%2Fdevices%2Fsurface-duo%3Factivetab%3Doverview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 price drop&lt;/a&gt; to $999 certainly makes it a more affordable device, but when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426955/microsoft-surface-duo-folding-android-phone-history"&gt;reviewed t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426955/microsoft-surface-duo-folding-android-phone-history"&gt;e Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; last year we praised the hardware and found the buggy modified version of Android made it difficult to use at times. The device also lacked many non-Microsoft apps that took advantage of the dual screens. TikTok was one of the bigger third-party apps that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176724/microsoft-surface-duo-availability-canada-europe-tiktok-support"&gt;got updated specifically for the Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; last year, but there are still not enough apps taking advantage of this unique hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikIuS4"&gt;While Microsoft has promised monthly updates for the Surface Duo, the company &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-needs-step-if-they-want-surface-duo-be-taken-seriously"&gt;failed to deliver an update&lt;/a&gt; in December. The updates haven’t done enough to improve the software experience of using the Surface Duo, despite its obvious potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Lt5uC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 11th 10:00AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Surface Duo launch details in other markets and updated US pricing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief chat with iamBrandonTV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0IWibcGZyE1O54BFcozX8ruf3u8=/68x0:826x505/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803188/iambrandon.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DkrAfG"&gt;There are as many ways to make it on Twitch as there are streamers. Even so, there is a culturally recognized type. And you can picture him — yes, &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; — now, can’t you? A young white guy in a gaming chair, playing something like a shooter or possibly an MMO, averaging hundreds or thousands of viewers with the subs and bits to match. This isn’t meant to be prescriptive, obviously — your fav is probably not this made-up guy — but I think it’s important to talk about who we typically think of when we talk about streamers because &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;many streamers &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; fit the stereotype, and we should recognize them, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8vx8l"&gt;Brandon Stennis is one of those people. He goes by &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/iambrandon"&gt;iamBrandon on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s an energetic, unapologetic queer Black advocate for marginalized people on Twitch. (He’s also fun as hell to watch.) Stennis was partnered on Twitch in 2016, a couple of years after he started streaming. Today, he’s also the influencer relations manager at Reverb Games, a position he’s had since last April — and yes, he says his experience as a content creator makes him better at his job. “I just have the upper hand because I know what it’s like to get an offer from a company,” he says. “It’s just easier for me to understand where a streamer’s coming from.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAxnws"&gt;In the beginning, however, he didn’t want to be a streamer. He wanted to be a journalist, someone who went out in the field and came back with a good story. It didn’t pan out. “When I was looking for jobs, they basically told me that I didn’t have experience, online experience, with like a portfolio or anything,” he tells me when I reach him over Discord. So in 2012, the summer after he graduated from college, he ended up spending a lot of time at home playing video games. “And that was my very first experience with online gaming,” he says. It led him to start his own blog, &lt;a href="http://UGRgaming.com"&gt;UGRgaming.com&lt;/a&gt;, a gaming news and reviews site. He eventually found a staff to help him out. Things were going well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dsMpE"&gt;They decided to update their social strategy and landed on Twitch. Stennis jumped in. “I quickly learned that you can’t promote a website on Twitch, it doesn’t work like that, it’s more about people’s personalities,” he says. “So I kind of just started, you know, being myself and playing games that I enjoyed, and wanted to play.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qIhu7K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hi, I am no longer going by UGR Gaming. I’ve decided to change my name to iamBrandon. UGR Gaming was an idea I had long ago. But I feel like it was time for me to market myself as myself, not an old brand I had in the past. Find me at &lt;a href="https://t.co/bK03UG8sLW"&gt;https://t.co/bK03UG8sLW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z82ScTVxsF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z82ScTVxsF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— iamBrandon  ️‍  (@iamBrandonTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamBrandonTV/status/929565923513692161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBk00m"&gt;People started gravitating toward his streams, which, at the time, were mostly &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;. “I was starting to see that people actually liked my personality. So I thought that streaming would be something that I wanted to fall into a little bit more,” Stennis says. He kept at it, founding a popular &lt;a href="http://www.twitchchicago.com/"&gt;Twitch Chicago meetup&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. “I kind of fell into it and didn’t realize what I was getting myself into, but then it turned into something that built up my career,” he says. UGR Gaming ended in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq4Ztd"&gt;Back then, when Stennis started, Twitch was a lot different. If you weren’t partnered, you didn’t have a sub button, which meant you couldn’t earn money from streams. You had to have more than 50 viewers to upgrade the quality of your streams, too. And, he says, there was no real sense of community. After &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; came &lt;em&gt;Outlast&lt;/em&gt; and speedrunning; Stennis managed to find his people and earned his partner badge. But he’s still vocal about how Twitch can do better at helping people find each other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNATXy"&gt;“I know, there’s good people who work for the company,” Stennis says. “But there are some people who just don’t care.” One of the things he’s been vocal about online is the issue of a trans tag on Twitch for the LGBTQ community, which streamers have wanted for a while. “The CEO of Twitch came out a few months ago on a live stream and basically said that they didn’t want to do it because they didn’t want to send harassment to trans streamers — but trans streamers and LGBT people and people of color are already dealing with harassment on the platform, because Twitch is not doing any good with the harassment that that’s already happening,” says Stennis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bQFghQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SteamyRefinedWheelNerfRedBlaster&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wHe0BJ"&gt;Twitch not being able to curb its harassment problem isn’t an excuse for standing in the way of a marginalized community trying to find each other. “They should have done it a long time ago. The community is very vocal about that,” he says. “And there’s been, you know, other tags that have come along very quickly and very fast that I feel are not as important as this one.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2Js1h"&gt;Twitch’s issues with its non-cis, non-white, and non-male populations are pretty well-documented online. During our chat, Stennis pointed out that Twitch is doing better this Black History Month than it has in the past. Even so, he was shocked that he had a pleasant experience being on Twitch’s front page, which has been highlighting Black streamers all month. (For people who don’t fit the traditional streamer stereotype, being featured on the front page of Twitch can be an exercise in harassment.) “I was taking a look at the total number of streamers on there, and it’s like 116,” he says. “And so it’s just like, obviously, there is an issue with visibility of Black creators and POC creators on this platform. If there’s only 116 people on this team — that’s very small compared to our counterparts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZKEuz"&gt;The work, as they say, continues. Despite everything — quarantine, COVID-19, etc. — Stennis says he’s doing well. “I’ve been able to finally take control of my streaming career in a really big and positive way,” he says. “I never thought I would be doing like... being a guest star on Rooster Teeth and all this kind of stuff. And there’s a lot more to come,” he says. And it’s at this very moment that G4, the gaming TV network, tweets at him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="No9pR2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In honor of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackHistoryMonth?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BlackHistoryMonth&lt;/a&gt;, G4 would like to celebrate award-winning variety content creator, cosplayer and host, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamBrandonTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@iamBrandonTV&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watch his Twitch and see even more of his work here➡️&lt;a href="https://t.co/5BVnOkvJoA"&gt;https://t.co/5BVnOkvJoA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fnuAcvIeix"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fnuAcvIeix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— G4TV (@G4TV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/G4TV/status/1357418656272179200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlOd41"&gt;“It’s just been crazy to see because like, you know, I watched G4 when I was a teenager, grew up on all the shows, and to see them recognize like me as a person,” he says. “And talk about me in that kind of way. It’s like literally insane, you know what I mean?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQTl4G"&gt;Stennis says he wants his streaming career to grow, but more than that, he wants to show other queer Black people that they have a space in gaming. “I knew when I walked into doing all this, I was walking into a white male-dominated field. That I was not going to be received well, so I did several different things,” he says. He hid who he was. “But as soon as I let that go, and I decided to be myself truly and open and honest, I saw so much love and saw how I was inspiring other people to just be themselves.” And that, I think, is a worthy goal. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How you can help astronomers hunt for undiscovered worlds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8o0DsFLRooVZkQv2rbYY0H2D5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803027/Feed_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kIFBQf"&gt;Astronomers discovered the stars closest to our Solar System more than 100 years ago. There’s the three-star &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/alpha-centauri-a-triple-star-system-about-4-light-years-from-earth.html"&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/a&gt; system about four light-years away and &lt;a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/barnards-star/"&gt;Barnard’s star&lt;/a&gt; about six light-years out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTyif2"&gt;But our celestial neck of the woods might be more crowded than we ever thought possible. In the past 25 years, astronomers have been identifying new objects that are also just a few light-years away: mysterious worlds known as brown dwarfs. Too large to be a planet but too small to become a star, brown dwarfs put out very little visible light, yet they glow brightly in the infrared. New infrared-enabled telescopes can image brown dwarfs effectively and have led to a raft of new discoveries — including &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20130311.html"&gt;a pair of dwarfs&lt;/a&gt; just past Barnard’s star. This pair is now the third-closest known system to ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohYnHh"&gt;There are untold thousands of unidentified brown dwarfs hiding in telescope imagery right now, but they aren’t exactly easy to pick up: they register as tiny smudges against a sea of other stars, galaxies, and photographic aberrations. It takes a careful human eye to spot them, so researchers interested in brown dwarf discovery find themselves in a bind: how to manually sift through millions of images of the night sky?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qm8y33"&gt;A few years back, a group of astronomers came up with a clever solution to that problem: a worldwide citizen-science effort that allows anyone with an internet connection to search through telescope imagery for new worlds. The project leverages an age-old trick to tease movement out of celestial imagery, and it’s allowed volunteers to locate thousands of new brown dwarfs. The effort may unearth worlds even closer to our Solar System than Alpha Centauri and could even turn up the Bigfoot of our Solar System: a hypothesized Planet 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnRbQA"&gt;Check out the video above to see how world-hunting works, and &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/backyard-worlds-planet-9"&gt;try it out for yourself&lt;/a&gt; on the project website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Call of Duty League will look very different in its second season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Call of Duty League - Launch Weekend" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nevRALAyQHFhUA_9phy1x7_gVws=/98x0:4303x2803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68803008/1196607733.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TxVO1a"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League kicked off its inaugural season last year with a bang. The CDL launched with an ambitious vision to merge esports with city-based teams, and it all started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21078871/call-of-duty-league-opening-weekend-esports-activision-blizzard"&gt;a live event at the Minneapolis Armory&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after, that vision was forced to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFTxvZ"&gt;Like most gaming leagues around the world, the CDL was forced to shift to an online format, eschewing in-person events. Perhaps surprisingly, the season was still a success; the league says last year’s finals between Dallas and Atlanta was the most-watched &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; match ever, with a peak of 330,000 viewers. (The winning team even won &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;an actual throne&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwws6s"&gt;According to CDL commissioner Johanna Faries, the league was able to learn from the experience of running a remote competition last year and make some notable changes for season 2, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CODLeague"&gt;which starts today&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s so much that we’ve done structurally with the season, but also strategically with how we celebrate our community and deliver world-class experiences, that I’d argue will be more of an improvement over last year,” Faries tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ht9PrE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nadeshot on getting back into Call of Duty with the Los Angeles Thieves","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552513/100-thieves-call-of-duty-league-cdl-la-nadeshot-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RWfOx6"&gt;The list of changes for season 2 is large. The league is adopting a new structure centered on five “major” tournaments throughout the year, and it has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fesports%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F29779791%2Fcall-duty-league-moving-4-4-season-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F11%2F22276595%2Fcall-of-duty-league-cdl-2021-season-preview-johanna-faries-interview#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shifted to 4 vs. 4&lt;/a&gt; competition, meaning each team had to drop a starting player from its roster. Games will also be played on PC this year, and — in one of the more unique aspects of competitive &lt;em&gt;COD&lt;/em&gt; — the game itself will shift to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21612873/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-review-zombies-warzone-multiplayer-impressions"&gt;last year’s &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Other changes are slightly smaller in scope, like the ability for teams to design their own jerseys. There’s even a new team: Optic Gaming has moved from LA to Chicago, opening up a spot for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552513/100-thieves-call-of-duty-league-cdl-la-nadeshot-interview"&gt;the new Los Angeles Thieves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="US2N0l"&gt;Faries says players and teams are involved in all of these decisions, particularly the ones that impact them most directly, like the roster changes. “Players and teams were exceedingly involved in that process,” she says of the move to 4 vs. 4. “We tend to mine for feedback pretty rigorously. We don’t like to make decisions in a silo or a vacuum. And I love that the outcome was well received, but we had a sense that that would be the outcome given how collaborative the process was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WFVeFO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrQM5Q_jMxs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy0nVM"&gt;The structural changes, meanwhile, were put in place to ensure that there are still plenty of big moments throughout the regular season, while also making each individual match feel important. “We love this notion of stage-based play, where nearly every month there’s going to be a new run at winning a major tournament in the regular season,” Faries explains. “That said, what’s also good about it is that every match is going to matter.” Teams will earn points from every match, and the top eight clubs will make it to the playoffs at the end of the season. “It all adds up,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGAspA"&gt;The 2021 season is also kicking off at an opportune time. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is arguably as popular as it’s ever been. Not only was &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; one of the top-selling titles of 2020, but the franchise has also reached new audiences through &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and the battle royale &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not clear how the CDL plans to take advantage of that, but Faries admits that there’s “such an opportunity” to bring new fans into the league through those games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdAcuT"&gt;Of course, the other big question is when the league will return to in-person events. Faries says that having teams based in cities around the world playing matches in home arenas is still the ultimate vision for the CDL. “We all want that,” she says. “We’re going to do it when it’s safe to do so, responsible to do so.” So while the 2021 season will start out online, the future of the league depends on both the global popularity of &lt;em&gt;COD&lt;/em&gt; and tapping into those major cities across the globe. “The two working together is really where the power of the vision of the CDL comes from.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tern HSD P9 review: the everything e-bike</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A midtail cargo bike for the whole family&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gt7YoQ"&gt;The best measure of an electric bike is how easily it slots into your everyday life. By that metric, the Tern HSD P9 is one of the better ones I’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u85wvq"&gt;Tern let me borrow one at the end of July, and I rode it at least 12 miles every day around my suburban New Jersey neighborhood for about a month and a half. I took my son to daycare, went to the grocery store, the farmer’s market, the liquor store, the drug store, and a variety of other places too menial to remember. It kept me socially distant from my neighbors as I rode around town and kept me out of my car, which I always appreciate. And whether I was hauling dual panniers loaded with groceries or just myself, the ride quality was impeccable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l65OxH"&gt;To be clear, this isn’t the fastest, most powerful, or even the best-looking e-bike I’ve ever ridden. But it was a solid workhorse that got the job done. That’s mostly due to the Bosch Active Line Plus mid-drive motor, one of the best on the market today, silently churning away between the cranks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZ2Peb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10334626"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xjnKEF"&gt;But it’s also because the HSD is an extremely flexible e-bike. The low-step frame combined with the adjustable handlebars and seat post, as well as a custom SunTour front suspension fork, help make this a bike that can easily be passed around among family members or friends. Riders of all shapes and sizes will feel at ease on the HSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3Frk3"&gt;If it looks a bit shrunken down for a cargo bike, that’s by design. Those in need of something larger can level up to the Tern GSD, which has an extended rack that can carry even more stuff than the HSD. (I’m testing a GSD right now, and I’m very infatuated with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IFka33"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it looks a bit shrunken down for a cargo bike, that’s by design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jtTctO"&gt;During my month-and-a-half test period, the HSD barely demanded my attention, nor did it draw any stares from passers-by or take up too much space in my garage. (I got one looky-loo from a lady who was impressed with the fingernail red paint job.) And while the $3,199 price tag means this won’t be an affordable option for many, you do get a lot of bike for that price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BS6ed"&gt;Regardless, when it comes to cargo bikes, I try not to compare it to other non-electric bikes, but rather to the car I am trying to replace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wR-HPXOjlyEwtv2E4163cKHZH2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870576/ahawkins_200825_4180_0034.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MyRzySaRCRvLT_lGIE0EPn557j0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870575/ahawkins_200825_4180_0040.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzcvFwZkGHqu4v1dXSoFbLtf1wU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870568/ahawkins_200825_4180_0098.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zMY4vHGvK_wLokFkMhojoMFgqPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870578/ahawkins_200825_4180_0025.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf7WIR"&gt;Tern got its name when several founding members of the company were hanging out poolside after a bike conference in Las Vegas, drinking beer and talking about the 2010 surfing documentary &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1407927/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;180° South&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a deep discussion about how people live with nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rizl40"&gt;Cycling through some possible names for their nascent company, the group eventually settled on Tern, the name for an Arctic migratory bird that is lightweight, a global traveler, and long-lived. It was also a homophone for “turn,” which fed into the group’s idea of “turning around and moving forward to face the challenges head-on,” according to Tern’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZSnkir"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Terns are Arctic migratory birds that are lightweight, global travelers, and long-lived&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6AFMq"&gt;Tern, which is headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, fancies itself an urban transportation company, but it’s mostly known for its non-electric, folding bikes. In August 2014, the company announced its first electric bike, the eLink, which weighed 46 pounds (21 kg) and could fold in under 10 seconds. The following year, Tern launched its first lineup of electrified models using BionX motor systems. Later, the company shifted to using more popular powertrain systems by Bosch and Bafang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrQqDN"&gt;The HSD P9, which first came out in 2019, is described as “enormously useful [and] surprisingly small.” Indeed, the HSD is a great bike for anyone looking for cargo-carrying power without those cumbersome cargo bike specs. It’s not exactly lightweight, clocking in at roughly 56 lbs. But when compared to electric cargo bikes from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20791435/radwagon-electric-cargo-bike-review-car-replacement"&gt;Rad Power Bikes&lt;/a&gt; (73 lbs), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21269590/carqon-cargo-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;Carqon&lt;/a&gt; (88 lbs), or &lt;a href="https://www.urbanarrow.com/"&gt;Urban Arrow&lt;/a&gt; (104 lbs), the HSD P9 is practically a featherweight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="751kW5"&gt;Speaking of specs, here’s what you need to know about the Tern HSD P9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1u2JZz"&gt;Motor: Bosch Active Line Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GFgZBF"&gt;Top speed: 20 mph (32 km/h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VYdgw5"&gt;Range: 26–69 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uvuVgv"&gt;Battery: 36V 11Ah (400 Wh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5X79xj"&gt;Weight: 56.5 lbs (25.7 kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aY6imz"&gt;Brakes: Shimano hydraulic disc brakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WD4dK1"&gt;Tires: 20 inches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mLEZPw"&gt;Extras: SunTour suspension front fork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2Jrlt4"&gt;Price: $3,199&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLT3lL-OiZlHdRX3lmcIrF25C7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870580/ahawkins_200825_4180_0019.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MJrcQK"&gt;The HSD P9 is a Class 1 electric bike in the US, meaning it’s pedal-assist with no throttle and a top speed of 20 mph. There were times when I missed the twist throttle, especially when getting started from a standstill on a steep incline with a kid and extra cargo on the rear rack. But I also understand why some manufacturers abhor the throttle — and honestly believe that throttles will eventually run into regulatory issues in the future — so I try not to begrudge any bike for its exclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTyGU1"&gt;HSD stands for “haul stuff daily” — or if you’re out of earshot of your kids, “haul shit daily.” Arleigh Greenwald, the eponymous Bike Shop Girl who recently got a job as a product manager at Tern (congrats, Arleigh!), &lt;a href="https://bikeshopgirl.com/tern-hsd-the-crossover-of-electric-bikes/"&gt;calls the HSD&lt;/a&gt; “the crossover of electric bikes,” and I wholeheartedly agree. If Riese and Muller’s Load 75 is the Cadillac Escalade of e-bikes and the RadWagon is the Chevy Suburban, then Tern’s HSD is definitely the Toyota Rav4 — a highly capable daily driver with just enough space for a kid and some cargo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="33cpZs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HSD stands for “haul stuff daily”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLX9s7"&gt;The HSD isn’t completely incognito — just look at that cherry red paint job. It does have some interesting design touches, from the “HSD” logo carved out of the frame below the head tube to the rear rack that also doubles as a stand for when you want to park the bike vertically. That’s a great space-saver for anyone who keeps their bike in their apartment, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzg20E"&gt;Tern makes a couple of folding bikes, like the Vektron, BYB, and fantastically named Verge. I would classify the HSD as a quasi-folding bike since it lacks the full folding capabilities of Tern’s other models. The handlebars can fold down, but that’s about it. Still, it’s a useful feature if you need to transport the bike in the back of your car, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkwmAZ"&gt;The rear rack is rated for 132 lbs, while the whole bike can carry a combined weight of 374 lbs. Tern sent me two of its Cargo Hold 37 panniers, each of which can hold several big grocery bags. When empty, the bags can be cinched tightly to the side of the bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqA7Cy"&gt;Performance-wise, I wasn’t that impressed with the 400Wh battery pack. While Tern claims the HSD has a range of 69 miles (110km), I found myself needing to recharge the battery after as little as 30 miles of riding on mostly flat surfaces with a few steep hills mixed in. This may seem paltry, but it’s fairly standard across e-bikes, especially while riding in the highest setting offered. This is my preferred riding style, and I know that’s true for many others. That said, more range would be nice, especially considering the HSD’s $3,199 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/in1L_t3ByfNTUgXKOFZWrgSUO2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21870573/ahawkins_200825_4180_0048.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlWHZl"&gt;The battery, while not integrated in the frame like I would prefer, was neatly stored behind the seat post, parallel to the rear rack. It’s a placement that I think is fairly unique to Tern, and it avoids the unsightliness of a bulging battery pack perched on the downtube. Plus, it helps distribute the weight to the back of the bike, which helps prevent it from toppling over when parking it vertically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s04u3M"&gt;The HSD’s small, fast wheels mean there’s a much lower center of gravity than most cargo bikes, which made cornering much more fun. And it’s shorter than the average road bike, which makes it easier to maneuver and store. The upright seating position gave me a good vantage point to see the cars around me, which made me feel safer while I rode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anHeyc"&gt;I find myself torn over the value proposition of the Tern HSD. It’s a smaller, lighter cargo bike than most, which is certainly an advantage, and yet, it costs noticeably more than other, more powerful cargo bikes. What do you get for that extra cash? Easy storage is nice, but most of that cost is for the Bosch mid-drive motor. The German company arguably makes one of the most reliable and dependable systems in the world — and that comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIqCaP"&gt;Overall, the Tern HSD P9 is a sturdy electric cargo bike that’s easy on the eyes and easy to stash away when needed. It’s highly adaptable and has a decently powerful drivetrain that shrinks most hills down to size. While I don’t think the HSD is for everybody, I do believe that it aspires to be easy and approachable enough that anyone can ride it. &lt;/p&gt;
