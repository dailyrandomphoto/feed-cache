    <title>Google is threatening to fire unvaccinated employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mtcNMgxcPKL418Jp5w_vFHRfnHU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70274648/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KgT0I3"&gt;Google employees who haven’t been vaccinated could be put on forced leave and then let go from the company if they fail to follow its COVID-19 rules, according to an internal memo &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/google-employees-to-lose-pay-if-dont-comply-with-vaccination-policy.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The policy will reportedly affect employees that would have fallen under the jurisdiction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;President Biden’s vaccine mandate&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/senate-resolution-opposing-biden-vaccine-mandate/index.html"&gt;currently facing challenges&lt;/a&gt; in the Senate and court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxs9o0"&gt;According to the memo, Google gave its employees until December 3rd to upload proof of vaccination or receive approval for a medical or religious exemption. The company says that anyone who doesn’t do either of those things by January 13th will be placed on a 30-day paid administrative leave. If they’re still not in compliance after the 30 days, they could face unpaid leave for up to six months and then be terminated, according to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouH4ey"&gt;Google isn’t denying the policy. Google spokesperson Lora Lee Erickson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CXp9yb"&gt;As we’ve stated before, our vaccination requirements are one of the most important ways we can keep our workforce safe and keep our services running. We’re committed to doing everything possible to help our employees who can get vaccinated do so, and firmly stand behind our vaccination policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Csz1Hn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anyone returning to Google’s offices will have to be vaccinated or have an exemption&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAT36R"&gt;The CNBC report points out that there may be some options for unvaccinated employees — while the company expects the president’s mandate to apply to mostly everyone, employees can look for positions that aren’t covered by it, presumably ones outside of an office. If they find one (or already have one) they’d also have to be able to do the job remotely. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;requires in-office employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly saying that frequent testing isn’t an acceptable alternative. There is also the option to request an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr42Cd"&gt;Though the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022"&gt;hasn’t determined when employees&lt;/a&gt; will have to come back to the office following the emergence of the omicron variant, it does expect that much of its workforce will be doing at least some work-in person. However, CNBC says that even remote workers will need to be vaccinated if they fall under the mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BA0dc"&gt;Both pay and vaccination requirements have been hot-button issues inside the company — during a company all-hands, executives fielded a question about whether Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828132/google-employee-wages-inflation-2021-record-profits"&gt;plans to raise wages to match inflation&lt;/a&gt; (the company said it didn’t plan to do so). &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/google-employees-sign-manifesto-against-widened-vaccine-mandate.html"&gt;CNBC also reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that an anti-vaccine mandate manifesto, signed by hundreds of employees, was shared within Google. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gifts for the aspiring and established content creators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="c4X606"&gt;From YouTube to Twitch to TikTok, or everyday photography, videography, and podcasting. To some degree, everyone is a content creator, whether it is a pursuit of a personal passion or for the consumption and streaming by a huge audience. Consequently, the most dedicated creators can also be the most difficult to shop for. What do you get for someone who is just starting out that will be most helpful? Or what about someone that’s a bit further along and more established?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Amzgyl"&gt;If you find yourself shopping for someone in your life that is looking to start something fresh or take their craft to the next level, we have a few gift ideas for you to check out before you run out of time. Some, like the Sony A6600 ($1,798), are no small investment but are favored by YouTubers far and wide. Others, like Shure’s MV7 mic ($219), could jumpstart a serious podcast project or be used by a professional, while picks like SanDisk’s Extreme Portable SSD ($88) are now considered everyday essentials. And fun ideas like the Ikea Lanespelare ($25) and Philips Hue Lightstrip kit ($80) could be a great choice for anyone who wants to freshen up the decor in a studio or streaming space, as they look great on-camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked documents link Huawei to China’s domestic spying in Xinjiang</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVDwtnu6QLthrXHdxRDehEuCn2w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70274070/acastro_190521_1777_huawei_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oP9vvr"&gt;Huawei was involved in building technology for labor and reeducation camps, as well as surveillance systems in China’s Xinjiang region, according to PowerPoint presentations &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/12/14/huawei-surveillance-china/"&gt;obtained and translated by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report shows some of the ways the tech giant’s work may have been involved in the persecution against ethnic minorities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPEkPz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; says it obtained the PowerPoints from a public Huawei site before they were taken down. According to the report, the slides included details on Huawei’s involvement with other companies in creating several systems and had metadata dating them anywhere from 2014 to 2020 (with copyright dates being listed from 2016 to 2018). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8jh-2FMit6agq5ghqalBY5lIOFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23096871/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_15.20.52.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translated slide describing some of Huawei’s work in smart prisons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VUEzwl"&gt;One of the slides talks about Huawei’s products being “the foundation of the smart prisons unified platform,” with reference to labor for manufacturing and analysis of reeducation efficiency. According to &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;, some of the prisons Huawei said its tech is used in are in Xinjiang, a region largely populated by Uyghur Muslims. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out many human rights violations against the Uyghurs, putting them in detention and reeducation camps and using them for forced labor. (Many tech companies have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;linked to the use of this labor&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="firstHeading"&gt;Another slide translated by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; details a surveillance system used in Xinjiang. It talks about how public security forces in the region’s capital of Ürümqi used a facial recognition system to catch a fugitive. In 2020, a report by video surveillance researchers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163499/huawei-uighur-surveillance-facial-recognition-megvii-uyghur"&gt;detailed Huawei’s work on a facial recognition system&lt;/a&gt; that could send an alert if it identified someone as a Uyghur. According to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, the presentations for Huawei’s work on surveillance systems don’t mention Uyghurs, and the company has denied directly supplying tech to Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fR-rGjfK_GRuc1Vnn1qXxMH1T5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23096878/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_15.22.19.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Other slides translated by &lt;/em&gt;The Post&lt;em&gt; described electronic surveillance systems.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pFTlv4"&gt;Other slides in the Post’s report detail technology used to identify people based on their voiceprint, systems to track people’s location based on surveillance footage, and tech to monitor employees at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWJMW4"&gt;Many companies have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745068/best-buy-home-depot-lorex-ezviz-uyghur-surveillance-sales-dji"&gt;placed on the US government’s Entity List&lt;/a&gt; (which restricts how US companies can do business with them) for allegedly helping the Chinese government run surveillance on minority groups in the Xinjiang region. One &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;major example is DJI&lt;/a&gt;, but few have received as much attention from the US government as Huawei, though the attention largely stemmed from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634046/huawei-donald-trump-us-trade-war-china-android-google-ban-5g-future"&gt;former President Trump’s trade war with China&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2020, the US government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126637/white-house-trump-huawei-investment-ericsson-nokia-china-trade-war-william-barr"&gt;suggested that telecoms spend their money with Huawei’s competitors&lt;/a&gt; and accused the company of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;building backdoors into its equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Six more women file lawsuits against Tesla, allege sexual harassment worsened by Musk’s tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3T8n3Zjs3SFUuRjSuIEM48iOFnE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70274044/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POWrym"&gt;Six more women who work at Tesla’s Fremont, California factory and service center have filed lawsuits against the company, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/14/tesla-sexual-harassment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each woman has filed a separate lawsuit in the California Superior Court in Alameda County, alleging that they’re subject to a culture of sexual harassment at the workplace. These new lawsuits come not even a month after two other women filed suit against the company with similar allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AVOrwz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One woman claims she told HR about the issue but was only moved to a different work area&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZNak2"&gt;The six women claim that their male coworkers frequently make lewd comments towards their bodies or clothes, as well as engage in abusive behavior like catcalling and inappropriate touching. Some women even went so far as to wear baggy clothing to conceal their bodies — one woman, Jessica Brooks, says she tied a flannel shirt around her waist to hide her backside in an attempt to escape harassment. She even barricaded herself in her workplace with boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwADkv"&gt;Brooks told &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; that she let human resources know about the issue but says she was only moved to a different work area. Other women who called attention to the behavior claim that they faced the same response that Brooks got; they allege the behavior wasn’t addressed, and they were simply moved to another location in the factory. &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; also notes that some women didn’t feel confident speaking to HR about the issue, as they claim that their managers also partook in the abusive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImGyUf"&gt;Another woman, Eden Mederos, told &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; that “everything got worse” once the Model Y was announced, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1106063248581894144"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “S3XY,” an acronym referencing the Model S, 3, X, and Y. Musk is also frequently observed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1277359833721655302"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1460062031084761090?s=20"&gt;out jokes&lt;/a&gt; mentioning “69” or “420” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769731/elon-musk-billionaire-tax-stock-sell-off-ron-wyden-tweet"&gt;other childish content&lt;/a&gt;, which Mederos told &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; “caused the technicians to be even worse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5nQ8y3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Please don’t call the manager on me, Senator Karen  &lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470858546153762819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sYyAfy"&gt;Just as reports of these lawsuits unfolded, Elon was in the midst of sending out snarky replies to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1470415896053227522"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; stating, “Let’s change the rigged tax code so The Person of the Year [Musk] will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else.” Musk immediately &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470848958897471497?s=20"&gt;replied with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; containing a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-is-a-fraud-her-lies-about-being-native-american-disqualify-her-from-presidency-senate.amp"&gt;2019 Fox News article&lt;/a&gt; titled, “Elizabeth Warren is a fraud — Her lies about being Native American disqualify her from presidency.” He called her “Senator Karen” in another reply, referring to the trope of a petty, obnoxious, and entitled white woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8vNH8"&gt;These six additional lawsuits come just after Jessica Barraza, who also works in Tesla’s Fremont factory, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791321/worker-sues-tesla-rampant-sexual-harassment-fremont-elon-musk"&gt;sued the electric car company for “rampant sexual harassment.”&lt;/a&gt; Like many of the other women suing Tesla, she also claims that she was subject to catcalling, physical touching, and inappropriate comments. And just days ago, another woman, Erica Cloud, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/12/22830673/tesla-sued-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-allegations"&gt;sued Tesla for sexual harassment and retaliation&lt;/a&gt;, with her claims echoing many of the ones mentioned here. It doesn’t stop there — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710279/tesla-racism-fremont-plant-137-million-judgement-owen-diaz"&gt;Tesla was ordered to pay $137 million&lt;/a&gt; after a Black employee claimed that he experienced racism and discrimination at the California plant. A &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-racism-unsafe-factory-conditions.html"&gt;class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; has also been proposed, alleging a racist work culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IhYy1"&gt;“Elon Musk tweeting a lewd comment about women’s bodies or a taunt toward employees who report misconduct reflects an attitude at the top that enables the pattern of pervasive sexual harassment and retaliation at the heart of these cases,” says attorney David A. Lowe, partner at Rudy Exelrod Zieff &amp;amp; Lowe, who is representing the six women.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rising temperatures are causing an unprecedented transformation in the Arctic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Arctic sea ice loss graph NSIDC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5f9CZyy3hPp_UXOolfiDlAaDcg=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273792/NOAA-sea-ice-loss.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b6JrWF"&gt;Climate change continues to create “cascading disruptions” in the Arctic as the region experiences rapid warming, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) writes in its 16th annual &lt;a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/Portals/7/ArcticReportCard/Documents/ArcticReportCard_full_report2021.pdf"&gt;Arctic Report Card&lt;/a&gt; released earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvqOwX"&gt;Pulling together the most recent data on temperature trends, sea ice cover, and more gathered in 2020 and 2021, this year’s Arctic Report Card includes 111 contributing writers from 12 countries, who detail the transformation taking place across the far north as a result of human-caused climate change. That includes dramatic sea ice losses, rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and exceptionally warm autumns. The Arctic experienced its warmest autumn on record between October and December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TkQxz"&gt;None of these observations are terribly surprising at this point — the Arctic is one of the fastest-warming regions on the planet, and scientists at NOAA and elsewhere have been documenting a cascade of impacts for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRw85m"&gt;“The trends are consistent, alarming, and undeniable,” NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said at a press conference at the American Geophysical Union today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fECF9"&gt;Twila Moon, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center who edited the report, noted that a series of “extreme events” brought “unprecedented conditions” to the Greenland ice sheet, which experienced three separate ice melts during the summer of 2021 for just the second time on record, Moon said. This year, Greenland also experienced rain in its summit for the first time in August. This sort of event has the potential to make the ice sheet more vulnerable to melt in the future, Moon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0XzdL"&gt;In addition to melting ice on the land and at sea, the report highlights how rising temperatures are shifting the ecosystems of the Arctic. One species in particular gets spotlit in the new report: beavers. According to NOAA, these ecological engineers are rapidly colonizing the warming Alaskan tundra, modifying the landscapes as they go by creating ponds that can affect the underlying permafrost soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzIAY0"&gt;Populations in the Arctic region have made efforts to adapt to the changing conditions, but the Arctic’s rapid evolution calls for more attention from those who reside there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOjPZb"&gt;“Our people live in these extremely variable conditions for thousands of years, and we’re very worried about the changes highlighted today,” Kaare Sikuaq Erickson, a science liaison from the Bering Sea village of Unalakleet, Alaska, said at the press conference. “It’s really tough for us to live up there, let alone thrive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vfEwdI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Arctic is the Earth’s air conditioner.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dNEHeF"&gt;Experts who spoke at the press conference emphasized that what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay there and that the changes will continue to intensify unless humanity takes more aggressive action on climate change. According to NOAA, since the mid-1960s, the Arctic has seen nearly 3 degrees Celsius of warming — far more than the global average rise of &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_FAQ_Low_Res.pdf"&gt;just over a degree Celsius&lt;/a&gt; since the late 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYLW7x"&gt;“The Arctic is the Earth’s air conditioner,” Spinrad said. “Billions of people rely on its moderating influence on climate. We have a narrow window of time to avoid very costly, deadly, irreversible future climate impacts.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram reportedly hit 2 billion active users but probably won’t admit it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sx95UwQDpahLqchViGmEMGadWxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273742/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J0lDrp"&gt;Instagram has reportedly climbed to 2 billion monthly active users, that is according to anonymous employees who broke the news to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/instagram-surpasses-2-billion-monthly-users.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Meta-owned company hasn’t — and probably won’t — officially disclosed these numbers, as it has spent the last several months under scrutiny for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22816730/mosseri-testimony-instagram-senate-hearing-haugen-child-safety-facebook-meta"&gt;potentially causing harm to kids and teens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ALQdk3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The last time Instagram publicly announced the size of its userbase was back in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4FhsOi"&gt;The last time Instagram publicly announced the size of its userbase was back in 2018 when the platform revealed that it had 1 billion users. It took three years for Instagram to hit the 2 billion mark. The employees who tipped off &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; say that they found out about the number during internal conversations — one staff member reportedly told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; that Instagram surpassed the threshold around a week before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Facebook’s decision to change its name to Meta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nkpn7"&gt;Instagram has been desperately trying to stay ahead of TikTok, the fast-growing short-form video app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users"&gt;just crossed 1 billion users in September&lt;/a&gt; — just three years after the app merged with Musical.ly and became widely available. While Instagram is still outpacing the platform, for now, it’s unclear how long that will last. Instagram has been rolling out feature after feature that just seems like a TikTok knockoff, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832529/instagram-reels-visual-replies-feature-tiktok-copy"&gt;newly released Reels Visual Reply&lt;/a&gt; is just the latest example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPcjeE"&gt;That said, Instagram isn’t really in the position to brag about its userbase right now, since its own internal study found that the platform may &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;exacerbate body image issues in young girls&lt;/a&gt; and has also been accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822584/instagram-teen-users-drugs-hashtags"&gt;making it easier for teens to find drugs&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to counteract these issues, the platform has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;rolled out a “take a break feature,”&lt;/a&gt; which prompts users to close the app if they’ve been on it for a set period of time, and also announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22821955/instagram-parental-controls-teenage-safety-features-take-a-break-nudge"&gt;introducing new parental controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk15Qn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Instagram with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s not-Chromecast Google TV dongle adds an ethernet jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ALQF0b48xhB7FxbBoVrATC1QY_Q=/0x0:2058x1372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273722/tvision_hub.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TVision Hub offers 4K streaming and ships with a voice-control remote&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gk6wc5"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;TVision streaming service was not long for this world&lt;/a&gt;, but its name lives on in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22834584%2Ft-mobile-tvision-hub-google-tv-chromecast-dongle-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub&lt;/a&gt; — a $50 dongle with Google TV. It appears to function a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s own Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, but along with some T-Mobile branding, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/14/tmobile-google-tv-ethernet-dongle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that it offers a feature you won’t find on Google’s streaming dongle: an ethernet jack. That direct internet connection may be a real benefit if your home Wi-Fi signal isn’t quite up to the task of streaming 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38xndx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-releases-new-tvision-hub-for-some-reason/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the device last week on T-Mobile’s website, which is a new version of the streaming dongle launched with the TVision service. It comes with a remote bearing Netflix, YouTube, and Google Assistant buttons and connects with accessories like game controllers and headphones via Bluetooth or USB-C. Like Chromecast, it supports 4K HDR streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2Ke8J"&gt;T-Mobile (probably wisely) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;shuttered its streaming TV subscription service&lt;/a&gt; just six months after it launched, opting instead to partner with YouTube TV and Philo. While the service is gone, it seems that the company wasn’t ready to let go of the TVision branding. The TVision Hub is available now for $50 and is offered free with a new home internet line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IBM and Samsung say their new chip design could lead to week-long battery life on phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFtBIa3RpclMEA3TSrbpjdjHGII=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273710/IBM_VTFET_06_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0tDiZa"&gt;IBM and Samsung have announced their latest advance in semiconductor design: a new way to stack transistors vertically on a chip (instead of lying flat on the surface of the semiconductor). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L34wNy"&gt;The new Vertical Transport Field Effect Transistors (VTFET) design is meant to succeed the current FinFET technology that’s used for some of today’s most advanced chips and could allow for chips that are even more densely packed with transistors than today. In essence, the new design would stack transistors vertically, allowing for current to flow up and down the stack of transistors instead of the side-to-side horizontal layout that’s currently used on most chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOARl7"&gt;Vertical designs for semiconductors have been a trend for a while (FinFET already offers some of those benefits); Intel’s future roadmap also looks to move in that direction, too, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21285821/intel-3d-stacked-lakefield-chips-hybrid-core-atom-arm-processor"&gt;its initial work focused on stacking chip components&lt;/a&gt; rather than individual transistors. It makes sense, after all: when you’ve run out of ways to add more chips in one plane, the only real direction (other than physically shrinking transistor technology) is to go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EfOJG8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OF3Zwfu6Ngc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bGi4IA"&gt;While we’re still a ways away from VTFET designs being used in actual consumer chips, the two companies are making some big claims, noting that VTFET chips could offer a “two times improvement in performance or an 85 percent reduction in energy use” compared to FinFET designs. And by packing more transistors into chips, IBM and Samsung claim that VTFET technology could help keep Moore’s law’s goal of steadily increasing transistor count moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEIwCs"&gt;IBM and Samsung are also citing some ambitious possible use cases for the new technology, raising the idea of “cell phone batteries that could go over a week without being charged, instead of days,” less energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining or data encryption, and even more powerful IoT devices or even spacecraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LZkJt"&gt;IBM has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422815/ibm-2nm-chip-processors-semiconductors-power-performance-technology"&gt;previously shown off its first 2nm chip&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, which takes a different route toward cramming more transistors by scaling up the amount that can be fit onto a chip using the existing FinFET design. VTFET would aim to take things further, however, although it’ll likely be even longer before we see chips based on IBM and Samsung’s latest technology out in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ot8iS"&gt;It’s not the only company looking to the future of production, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;Intel previewed its upcoming RibbonFET&lt;/a&gt; (Intel’s first &lt;a href="https://blog.lamresearch.com/finfets-give-way-to-gate-all-around/"&gt;gate-all-around transistor&lt;/a&gt;) design over the summer, its own successor to FinFET production technology, which is set to be part of the Intel 20A generation of semiconductor products scheduled to start ramping production in 2024. The company also recently announced its own plan &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-components-research-looks-beyond-2025.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;CID=iosm&amp;amp;icid=100002749961528%257Calways-on&amp;amp;linkId=100000094062584#gs.jewhz0"&gt;for stacked transistor technology&lt;/a&gt; as a potential successor for RibbonFET in the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inscryption mod makes the game’s best part endlessly replayable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cstoxegAdPnRiLG4lZTS9Xp4kvE=/151x0:1770x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70272932/ss_738220c84b63522c4ca8c77fbff1ddb252ea0fe9.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FUmcX0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;, my game of the year, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/22796149/50-best-video-games-of-2021-polygon-goty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;’s game of the year&lt;/a&gt;, and what should be your game of the year, is getting a free mini update that gives its fans exactly what they want —  a way to endlessly play the game’s first act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvgYEa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1092790/view/3141821139285428848"&gt;Kacyee’s Mod&lt;/a&gt;, available now as a playable beta, adds new cards, items, and a difficulty modifier that make &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;’s already challenging card game even spicier. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DMullinsGames"&gt;Daniel Mullins&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;, says he made this mod in response to fans’ overwhelming support of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVqmt0"&gt;“This mini-expansion is in part an expression of my gratitude,” Mullins wrote on Steam. “I have received countless requests for an endlessly playable version of Part 1 that emphasizes Leshy’s deckbuilding roguelike as a standalone experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pfveY"&gt;Part one of &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt; locks you in a cabin with a vicious woodsman who will only release you if you beat him in a succession of card games. Through progress across three maps and solving an assortment of escape-room style puzzles, players earn new cards, enhance current cards, and assemble a collection of items that can turn a lost game in your favor sometimes at a gruesome price. Players familiar with&lt;em&gt; Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; will recognize their elements in &lt;em&gt;Inscryption.&lt;/em&gt; The cards you use to beat the woodsman have attack and life values and unique abilities that synergize with one another to create devastatingly overpowered combos that are an utter delight to assemble and trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vPB3c"&gt;From beginning to end, &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt; is a shining achievement in storytelling and gameplay, and &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;’s first act is the strongest, most compelling, most addictingly fun part of that achievement. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22757407/inscryption-review-pc-steam-devolver-digital"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I lamented that the game ended, wishing there was some way to set the game on an endless loop of deckbuilding and boss fights. Kaycee’s Mod is an answer to my and many others’ wish. &lt;/p&gt;
