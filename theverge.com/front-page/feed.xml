    <title>Charging company EVgo is going public via SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NojFpK"&gt;Another company in the electric vehicle industry is going public by merging with a so-called SPAC, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;. This time, it’s EVgo, one of the leading providers of electric vehicle charging stations in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mzQ7B"&gt;The deal is expected to bring in $575 million for EVgo. When it closes, EVgo will become a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPTme8"&gt;In something of a poetic twist, the investment fund that’s merging with EVgo to take it public is &lt;a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/david-crane-back-climate-tech-spac"&gt;one started by climate investor David Crane&lt;/a&gt;. Crane was once the CEO of energy company NRG, which helped start EVgo a decade ago. Roughly $175 million of the proceeds will come from Crane’s SPAC (called Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation). The other $400 million is coming from a new, concurrent round funding organized by Crane’s SPAC that includes institutional investors like BlackRock and Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OSVyP"&gt;There has been a mad rush of SPAC mergers in the electric vehicle space across the last seven months as investors looked to capitalize on the momentum created by Tesla’s skyrocketing valuation. EVgo joins the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;Fisker Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293615/arrival-uk-electric-bus-ev-photos"&gt;Arrival&lt;/a&gt;, Hyliion, and competitor ChargePoint in going public via the SPAC route. It certainly won’t be the last, either, as startups like Lucid Motors and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/19/22229493/faraday-future-spac-merger-psac-public-ipo-stock"&gt;even Faraday Future are in talks to do the same&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBU9wO"&gt;“What is so heartening to me,” Cathy Zoi, EVgo’s CEO, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview, “[is] the market now has an appetite to support businesses that do what EVgo does.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QslFzM"&gt;EVgo currently operates more than 800 DC fast charging stations across 34 states in the US. Last year it announced a partnership with General Motors that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349614/general-motors-evgo-fast-charging-network-investment"&gt;is supposed to triple that number&lt;/a&gt;, while also building out the ability to charge at faster rates comparable to those offered by Tesla’s Supercharger and Volkswagen’s Electrify America networks. It has also partnered with Uber and Lyft to supply chargers for electrified ride-hailing vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ECRF"&gt;Going public won’t change those expansion goals, according to Zoi. “This capital enables us to execute on a business plan and we can continue to do what we do, which is build and operate convenient, reliable fast charging across America as the market moves more quickly to electrify cars,” she said. Zoi also said she believes EVgo can carve out a big position in the commercial space, as more companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;including, most recently, GM&lt;/a&gt; — focus on electrifying trucks and vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77TyUr"&gt;The recent boom in SPAC mergers has been so formidable that some companies are going public despite having any shot at near-term profitability. And while much of the attention may wind up focused on the consumer-facing companies, Crane told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview that his team was “wildly successful” in convincing the investors like PIMCO and BlackRock of EVgo’s advantage: making technology that other automakers — big and small — rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrsFF2"&gt;“I don’t think we came across a single investor that expressed even an iota of doubt about the market here. Where the fault line seems to be developing for investors is a lot of them are far more attracted to what Cathy does — which is, as long as [companies make new] plug-in vehicles, Cathy wins,” he said. “There are [investors] that are a little leery about betting on individual automakers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYi3zI"&gt;“Everyone would like to duplicate a Tesla valuation, but they realize that there isn’t going to be [a lot of those],” Crane added. “So a company like EVgo that serves the whole sector is attractive to everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uX9GAg"&gt;One downside of SPAC mergers is that, since it’s technically an acquisition, the company being acquired faces looser regulatory scrutiny than if they had gone the traditional IPO route. It’s hard to say what kind of problems that can cause just yet, as most of these deals closed recently. But it became an issue with Nikola last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;when accusations of fraud started flying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzzS1R"&gt;Zoi said the difference with EVgo is that it has a product out in the world. “Whether you’re a giant institutional investor or whether you are a person who’s just managing his or her own money, you can actually go and check out an EVgo station, and say this is reliable, convenient,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4KlBt"&gt;Crane, meanwhile, emphasized the months-long process that led to acquiring EVgo in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYb1Be"&gt;“We were very thorough in our due diligence. And we we asked a lot of questions. We talked to a lot of people. We did a lot of research, he said. “I think people look at myself and my partners and (his SPAC) and say, yeah, you know, we believe that they kicked the tires and there aren’t going to be unhappy surprises here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIUW0N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will reportedly make 3nm processors at expanded Texas plant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYqxYCzg_wtAx1UfLogFwm9-pqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68704341/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wM5xLr"&gt;Samsung is considering spending over $10 billion to build an advanced new logic chipmaking plant in Austin, Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/samsung-is-said-to-consider-10-billion-texas-chipmaking-plant"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The plant may be capable of making processors as advanced as 3nm, and would be Samsung’s third worldwide to use extreme ultraviolet lithography technology in its chip production. If the plans go ahead, construction at the plant could begin this year, with operations commencing as soon as 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1dS0K"&gt;An advanced US-based Samsung fabrication plant could provide Samsung a foothold in getting new contracts from US customers amidst ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. The move would also bring Samsung into closer competition with TSMC, which manufactures chips for Apple, among others, including the 5nm processors found inside Apple’s latest iPhones and Macs. TSMC is also investing in a US-based plant, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;a $12 billion location in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to start making chips by 2024. In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Samsung said it had yet to make a decision about its plans for a new US facility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lO4M7N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As part of an attempt to push more into the processor market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="smMY95"&gt;Samsung plans to invest $116 billion over the next decade into non-memory chips, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-logic-chips/samsung-plans-116-billion-investment-in-non-memory-chips-to-challenge-tsmc-qualcomm-idUSKCN1S00CV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. Chips produced in Austin are currently thought to be limited to less advanced 14-nanometer process nodes, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-expands-Texas-chip-plant-in-investment-race-with-TSMC"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung hopes to begin offering chips based on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-11-17/samsung-intensifies-chip-wars-with-bet-it-can-catch-tsmc-by-2022"&gt;3nm processor node technology in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. While the South Korean giant’s strength has traditionally been in memory chips, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the market for logic devices like smartphone and computer processors is more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIUwjf"&gt;Samsung’s plans for the plant are reportedly still in their preliminary stages, but some initial steps have already been taken. &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Samsung-expands-Texas-chip-plant-in-investment-race-with-TSMC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in December that Samsung had already acquired a 440,000-square-meter plot in Austin, where it’s had a manufacturing presence since the 90s. Last year, city officials began reviewing the company’s request to rezone the land for industrial use. Closing the deal could be dependent on Samsung negotiating controversial tax benefits and subsidies from the Biden administration, though &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports it may also go ahead without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emmQHp"&gt;Samsung already manufactures chips for Qualcomm and Nvidia, and is reportedly close to signing a new deal with Intel. &lt;a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/01/133_302906.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung could produce 15,000 graphics chips for Intel starting in the second half of this year at Samsung’s Austin plant. Incoming Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has said outsourcing may be a part of the company’s future, saying that although company plans to continue producing the majority of its chips internally, it may outsource the manufacturing of “certain technologies and products” in 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-to-stay-mostly-inside-11611274502?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DjZg7"&gt;With its investment, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Samsung is capitalizing on a growing trend for companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google to design their own chips and outsource manufacturing to companies like Samsung and TSMC. As well as making chips for others Samsung also produces its own Exynos-branded processors for use in its smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhaP2L"&gt;Samsung still faces a big challenge competing with TSMC, which plans to invest $28 billion this year alone. In contrast, Samsung’s semiconductor business invested $26 billion last year in capital expenditure, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes this was mainly in support of its memory business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvboxb"&gt;The investment could be complicated by the availability of Samsung heir and de facto leader Jay Y. Lee, who was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236716/samsung-lee-jae-yong-prison-bribery-ruling"&gt;ordered back to prison&lt;/a&gt; for two years and six months on bribery charges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor announces its first post-Huawei phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNLv0oIpgCV-YYhA0_gtZBZP9uo=/0x0:1098x732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703668/hv40.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMIZyw"&gt;Honor has announced the new V40 5G flagship phone, its first since Huawei sold the company off to a Shenzhen-based consortium of Chinese partners. The phone is exclusive to China for now, but Honor’s V-series usually makes its way to the rest of the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151055/honor-9x-pro-release-date-price-camera-google-apps-service-mwc"&gt;under “View” branding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qR5Qj"&gt;The V40 has a 6.72-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ processor. The primary camera has a 1/1.56-inch 50-megapixel sensor. The 4,000mAh battery can be charged wirelessly at 50W or at 66W with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPGY4t"&gt;Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was selling off Honor in November due to “tremendous pressure” and a difficulty in securing an adequate supply chain. While Honor was operated independently from Huawei, it relied on the parent company for much of its technology, such as HiSense’s Kirin processors. That meant it was hit just as hard by US sanctions banning US companies from doing business with Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RVez89sFMcc4GyZJZiEFicb5yWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251828/v40.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tejl7I"&gt;The V40 phones will of course have been in development since earlier than November, but now that Huawei has divested itself of Honor, the international “View 40” version of the V40 may be able to ship with Google services on board. That would allow Honor to sell phones in Western markets and beyond without the huge disadvantage of having to rely on Huawei’s AppGallery, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;still can’t compete with Google’s Play Store&lt;/a&gt; outside of China, where Google has no presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1aJcx"&gt;At the same time, Honor no longer has the advantage of relying on Huawei’s supply chain, so it’s going to have work to do in order to establish itself as a strong brand in its own right once the phones launch elsewhere. For now, it’s available in China with prices starting at 3,599 yuan (~$550) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. 3,999 yuan (~$620) doubles the storage to 256GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bond, Uncharted and Ghostbusters movies all just got delayed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/diS5laQ-TtcoQit3FDPp5lVgB6Y=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703244/bond_25_B25_31842_RC2_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: DANJAQ and MGM / Nicola Dove&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4whVe"&gt;Hollywood has decided tonight’s the night to shove back their slate of films — including James Bond’s latest outing &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die, &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie, and &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife. No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; now has a release date of October 8th, &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters &lt;/em&gt;will be pushed back five months to November 11th&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; now won’t arrive until 2022, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ERCboxoffice/status/1352427540292407297"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exhibitor Relations&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP18VH"&gt;Bond was the big film whose third delay was enough to force theater chains Regal and Cineworld to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/3/21500538/regal-cineworld-theaters-shut-down-james-bond-us-uk"&gt;close all their US and UK locations&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally slated for April 2020, then got pushed back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164789/james-bond-no-time-to-die-movie-delayed-coronavirus"&gt;November 2020&lt;/a&gt; and now to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re counting, this news marks the fourth delay. Instead of releasing the movie on streaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;as other studios have been doing&lt;/a&gt;, MGM seems adamant on premiering the movie in theaters — but by the time it’s safe to do so, there may not be as many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saZFX3"&gt;AMC has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169538/amc-theaters-revenue-closing-warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;warned investors&lt;/a&gt; that it’s about to run out of money, and other theaters also might not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504536/movie-theaters-close-regal-cineworld-amc-cinemark"&gt;survive past the middle of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. So the Bond franchise moving to the end of the year is not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AQw8Ch"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;NO TIME TO DIE 8 October 2021 &lt;a href="https://t.co/HZlNG5kz8t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HZlNG5kz8t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— James Bond (@007) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/007/status/1352416833815633922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EGkFY3"&gt;We can probably expect even more films to be delayed as delay piles on top of delay, since only a certain number of films can successfully premiere at physical theaters in any given span of time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google threatens to remove its search engine from Australia if new law goes into effect</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F92iNg"&gt;Google is threatening to pull its search engine from an entire country — Australia — if a proposed law goes into effect that would force Google to pay news publishers for their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdFW0c"&gt;“If this version of the Code were to become law it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,” Google Australia and New Zealand VP Mel Silva told Australia’s Senate Economics Legislation Committee today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0W3tCq"&gt;“We have had to conclude after looking at the legislation in detail we do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia,” she added, &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/google-threatens-to-disable-search-in-australia-if-media-code-becomes-law-20210122-p56w2h.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oR7RxV"&gt;The company, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371709/google-australia-paying-for-news-lobbying-media-ads-search-market"&gt;been lobbying against Australia’s plan for months&lt;/a&gt;, claims the country is trying to make it pay to show links and snippets to news stories in Google Search, not just for news articles featured in places like Google News, saying it “would set an untenable precedent for our business, and the digital economy” and that it’s “not compatible with how search engines work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8XRNNT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t respond to threats”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PHyxYG"&gt;Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was quick to respond. “We don’t respond to threats,” said Morrison, according to comments &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-news-australia-new-zealand-scott-morrison-bills-06e735a2f7670c35c4000ec8059cdced"&gt;carried by the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That’s done in our Parliament. It’s done by our government. And that’s how things work here in Australia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usy66h"&gt;Google’s got some notable allies who agree with that: Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the world wide web, &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/TLABNewsMedia/Submissions"&gt;submitted his opinion (see number 46 here) &lt;/a&gt;that “the Code risks breaching a fundamental principle of the web by requiring payment for linking between certain content online.” Vint Cerf, another founder of the internet who helped design TCP/IP, shared similar thoughts with the Committee, though it’s worth noting he currently works for Google as its Chief Internet Evangelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSkZ2W"&gt;Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which drafted the law, &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/response-to-google-open-letter"&gt;seemed to suggest in August&lt;/a&gt; that this shouldn’t affect Google’s search business: “Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so.” Clearly, Google disagrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYAxFH"&gt;As Google explains &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/mel-silvas-opening-statement/"&gt;in Silva’s full statement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/8-facts-about-google-and-news-media-bargaining-code/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;an accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;, it would rather pay publishers specifically for its Google News products. (It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302791/google-news-publishers-pay-content-australia-germany-brazil"&gt;already announced a program&lt;/a&gt; to pay publishers in Australia, Germany and Brazil back in June.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxuCOT"&gt;Australia didn’t seem to think that’s enough, though. The ACCC believes the proposed law addresses “a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook.” As my colleague Jon Porter put it in August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qTT8hQ"&gt;Australia’s proposed News Media Bargaining Code law, which is currently in draft and targets Facebook alongside Google, follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/26/facebook-and-google-face-tighter-rules-in-australia-as-accc-releases-report"&gt;2019 inquiry&lt;/a&gt; in Australia that found the tech giant to be taking a disproportionately large share of online advertising revenue, even though much of their content came from media organizations. Since then, the news and media industry have been hit hard by the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/news-corp-to-suspend-print-editions-of-60-local-newspapers-as-advertising-revenue-slumps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that over a hundred local newspapers in Australia have had to lay off journalists and either shut down or stop printing as advertising revenue has fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1VBRMI"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;also in the ACCC’s sights&lt;/a&gt; with this particular law, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409644/facebook-block-news-australia-legislation-google-publishers"&gt;threatening to block its news from being shared in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, too. Both companies are calling these blockages a “worst case” scenario, and Google insisted it wasn’t a threat, but it certainly sounds like one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqJu0i"&gt;You can read the full bill for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6652"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, though fair warning it’s a pretty dense read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQK2PT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 22nd, 12:54AM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that internet pioneers Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf are also concerned with parts of the proposed law, and provided a link to the bill itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9bb9O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 22nd, 3:14AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comments from the Australian Prime Minister.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet is shutting down Loon, its internet balloon company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EK1olUuoKiOjCNcpH_VN0DEZCnI=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703055/1_gEo3FCKfchd_3UWWUalsjg.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alphabet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0s7kYa"&gt;Alphabet is shutting down Loon, its division that provides internet from floating balloons, according to a post on the &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/loons-final-flight-e9d699123a96"&gt;blog of Alphabet’s X moonshot division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVJdvn"&gt;“The road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped,” Astro Teller, who leads X, wrote in the blog. “In the coming months, we’ll begin winding down operations and it will no longer be an Other Bet within Alphabet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKF73T"&gt;Alphabet, the parent company of Google, launched Loon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/14/4432262/google-unveils-project-loon-ballon-powered-internet-for-the-entire"&gt;in June 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and Loon “graduated” from a moonshot to an independent company within Alphabet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/11/17559520/google-alphabet-loon-wing-independent-companies-internet-drones-balloons"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Loon launched its first commercial internet service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315961/alphabet-loon-balloons-internet-kenya-telkom-4g-remote-areas"&gt;in Kenya in July&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of a fleet of about 35 balloons that covered an area of around 50,000 square kilometers. Loon has also provided internet services to areas affected by natural disasters, deploying balloons to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/20/16512178/alphabet-project-loon-puerto-rico-lte-balloons-disaster-relief-connectivity"&gt;Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/loon-for-all/loon-balloons-are-now-connecting-users-in-peru-8daa32db32b7"&gt;Peru following an earthquake in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfmHpn"&gt;Teller says that Loon is working to place employees in other roles at X, Google, and Alphabet. “A small group of the Loon team will stay to ensure Loon’s operations are wrapped up smoothly and safely — this includes winding down Loon’s pilot service in Kenya,” according to Teller. Loon’s service in Kenya will run until March, an X spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. To support those in Kenya who might be affected by the loss of Loon’s service, Loon is pledging $10 million to support nonprofits and businesses in Kenya dedicated to “connectivity, Internet, entrepreneurship and education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jYkbT"&gt;Loon isn’t the only moonshot that Alphabet has shut down. It wound down Makani, which aimed to use wind turbines attached to kites to create renewable electricity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143540/alphabet-discontinues-makani-flying-wind-turbine-drone-kites-clean-energy"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. And Project Foghorn, which researched how to create clean fuel from seawater, ended its work &lt;a href="https://x.company/projects/foghorn/"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now play Resident Evil Village’s ‘Maiden’ demo on PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zdo__mL7QvQ_5IvTn3He9pnQ6wc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702927/EsSdHQkW4AERbgv.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnDuIC"&gt;If you’ve got a PlayStation 5, you probably know there’s not a lot to play right now — particularly if you’ve already finished &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177015/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-launch-2020"&gt;the likes of &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But here’s something to (very briefly) tide you over: you can now download the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village &lt;/em&gt;“Maiden”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;demo ahead of the full game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;just-announced May 7th&lt;/a&gt; release date. It wasn’t available in the PS Store at first, but it’s been there for about an hour now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rzwbX"&gt;In the PlayStation Store on my PS5, the game was featured front and center in the “What’s hot” section for me, and I was able to start the download with a couple button presses. But if you’re away from your PS5 and want to remotely download the demo so it’s ready to play later, there’s a few ways to go about that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lTlKWG"&gt;If you’re using a browser, &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-PPSA01858_00-DEMOVILLAGE00001"&gt;here’s the link&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Maiden’s&lt;/em&gt; listing on the PlayStation Store, where you should be able to add the game to your library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hkrw40"&gt;If you’re using the PlayStation mobile app, tap the magnifying glass at the bottom of the screen and search for “maiden.” For me, &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; was the fourth search result. Tap on that, and you should be able to start the download from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mNwBIe"&gt;On the mobile app, you can also access the &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; page from the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; listing by tapping the box above the preorder button and selecting &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; from the list of editions for &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPtoO__GsBbrmjVSEviAjS0v4ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251360/village_demo_re_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s where to find the demo in the app. Click on that “PS5 Standard Edition” option to change it to “Maiden.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ivRiWM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maiden &lt;/em&gt;is a separate experience from &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village &lt;/em&gt;where&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you play as a character known as “the maiden” instead of &lt;em&gt;Village’s&lt;/em&gt; protagonist, Ethan Winters. If you want to learn more about the demo before downloading, check out &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/21/resident-evil-village-maiden-demo-hits-ps5-today/"&gt;this post on the PlayStation Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1UGzs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will launch on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC on May 7th. Capcom says a “multiplatform demo” for the game will be available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1352378538171756549"&gt;this spring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dems push Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for anti-radicalization changes after Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Hearing Held On Protecting Scientific Integrity In Coronavirus Response" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MAWWZ09UhqCdKSXXc4mlPDSKWN8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702511/1212981411.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Greg Nash-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="33JOxX"&gt;Only hours after gaining full control of Congress, House Democrats are going after &lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20Facebook%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20Twitter%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20YouTube%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for the platforms’ perceived roles in inciting violence at the Capitol earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGd0q5"&gt;In letters addressed to the chief executives of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), along with dozens of other members, called for the companies to make sweeping changes to their platforms to curb violent and extremist activity on their networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUUvqq"&gt;The lawmakers accused the companies of using certain product features and algorithms that boost content that evokes extreme emotions as a means of increasing engagement, pointing out specific features they want to see changed on each platform. For YouTube, lawmakers said they would like to see the company disable auto-play and stop recommending any conspiratorial content alongside videos or on users’ homepages. Facebook was asked to start a “fundamental reexamination” of its use of user engagement “as the basis of algorithmic sorting and recommendation.” Lawmakers also asked Twitter to begin prompting users to quote-tweet tweets instead of automatically retweeting them when the retweet button is selected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EepHlT"&gt;“The horrific damage to our democracy wrought on January 6th demonstrated how these social media platforms played a role in radicalizing and emboldening terrorists to attack our Capitol,” Eshoo said in a statement Thursday. “These American companies must fundamentally rethink algorithmic systems that are at odds with democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J4wJV"&gt;Facebook and YouTube declined to comment. A Twitter spokesperson said they had received the letter and planned to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FeMAT"&gt;Earlier Thursday, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;called on FBI Director Chris Wray&lt;/a&gt; to open an investigation into Parler, a conservative-leaning Twitter dupe, following the pro-Trump Capitol attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glWTxR"&gt;Maloney said that the House Oversight Committee would begin its own probe into Parler and other social media websites like it. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/21/parler-fbi-russia-jan-6-capitol/"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Maloney said, “I am going to get to the bottom of who owns and funds social media platforms like Parler that condone and create violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9bJ03"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/21/21 at 6:03PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Included statement from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve put him somewhere warm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PlMycU"&gt;You may have seen the many memes of Sen. Bernie Sanders sitting at President Joe Biden’s inauguration (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241049/bernie-sanders-inauguration-sitting-meme"&gt;we even did a rundown of the best ones&lt;/a&gt;), but now &lt;a href="https://bernie-sits.herokuapp.com"&gt;there’s a website that lets you&lt;/a&gt; easily drop Bernie and his chair all over the world with the help of Google Maps’ Street View (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bernie-sanders-can-sit-anywhere-world-power-google-maps"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Simply put in a location or address in the website, and after one button click, you’ll have an image of Bernie sitting wherever you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXFMPU"&gt;The site, made by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nick_sawhney/status/1352070155141079043"&gt;NYU masters student Nick Sawhney&lt;/a&gt;, is pretty bare-bones, and it’s not exactly fast — though &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bernie-sanders-meme-street-view-site"&gt;the fact that it’s getting a lot of traffic&lt;/a&gt; could be partially to blame. As you can imagine, there are a lot of people, like me, using it for shenanigans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avrvdq"&gt;Here are a couple of examples Sawhney made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8KZfH2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I made a website where you can put bernie in places using google maps street view. Enjoy!&lt;a href="https://t.co/UfY5g9xU2k"&gt;https://t.co/UfY5g9xU2k&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8rstiEXOHf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8rstiEXOHf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nick (@nick_sawhney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nick_sawhney/status/1352070155141079043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GYViCT"&gt;And here are the results of me goofing around with the site for an embarrassing amount of time: &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh cool, I didn’t know Bernie was a Fallout: New Vegas fan!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Image of Bernie sitting at the Green Dragon Inn in Hobbiton from Lord of the Rings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kSATqDDN6yHYB18o1BpO2nECsCU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250866/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.31.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie’s looking for the best brew in the Shire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ELV0gO"&gt;Three cheers to Sawhney for this glorious meme generator. I’m sorry for how much I cost you in Google Maps API calls and Heroku fees. (If you want to help keep the site up, you can &lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nicksawhney"&gt;toss Sawhney a few bucks here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
