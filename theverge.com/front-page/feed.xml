    <title>News sites are liable for defamatory Facebook comments, rules Australia’s High Court</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UTAKge"&gt;Media companies in Australia can be held responsible for defamatory comments left on their social media pages by members of the public, the country’s High Court has ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcgUg"&gt;The decision is part of a long-running defamation case that could have huge consequences for Australia’s media industry, forcing news sites to strictly moderate or remove comments on stories shared on Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/high-court-rules-media-are-liable-for-facebook-comments-on-their-stories-heres-what-that-means-for-your-favourite-facebook-pages-167435"&gt;Writing in &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, David Rolph, a professor of law at the University of Sydney, said the ruling “may mean anyone who runs a social media page can theoretically be sued over disparaging comments posted by readers or random group members — even if you aren’t aware of the comment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d4oViw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“anyone who runs a social media page can theoretically be sued over disparaging comments”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="plQA79"&gt;The ruling (which can be read in full &lt;a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA//2021/27.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is part of a defamation lawsuit brought against a number of outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, by Australia’s Dylan Voller. Shocking photographs of Voller being &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-25/four-corners-evidence-of-kids-tear-gas-in-don-dale-prison/7656128"&gt;restrained at a youth detention center&lt;/a&gt; went viral in 2016 and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/24/don-dale-no-charges-to-be-laid-over-royal-commission-findings"&gt;led to an inquest&lt;/a&gt; into the conditions at such centers. Many news outlets covered the story and shared their articles on Facebook. In 2017, Voller sued three of these companies, arguing that comments left on their Facebook pages in reaction to these stories were defamatory, and that, by inviting these comments, the news outlets were legally their publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDDxyL"&gt;It’s this second point which has proved particularly contentious, but a number of courts have found in favor of Voller’s argument. These include the Supreme Court of New South Wales &lt;a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2019/766.html"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and the New South Wales Court of Appeal &lt;a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2020/102.html"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This latest ruling, a 5-2 decision by Australia’s High Court, seems to settle this particular element of the case, establishing that media companies are indeed the “publishers” of third-party Facebook comments and can be held legally responsible for their content. However, Voller still has to prove that the comments themselves were defamatory, while media companies can now marshal new defenses under defamation law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYhkey"&gt;Although Voller’s case is not yet over, Australian media companies are extremely worried by the wider implications of the High Court’s ruling. A spokesperson for Nine, one of the companies sued by Voller, &lt;a href="https://www.mediaweek.com.au/high-court-rules-media-outlets-could-be-liable-for-facebook-comments/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the decision “will have ramifications for what we can post on social media in the future.” Michael Miller, executive chairman at News Corp Australia, another firm targeted in the case, said the finding “highlights the need for urgent legislative reform” that will “bring Australian law into line with comparable western democracies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGmnnv"&gt;As Miller noted in comments &lt;a href="https://www.mediaweek.com.au/high-court-rules-media-outlets-could-be-liable-for-facebook-comments/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;MediaWeek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The decision by the High Court in the Voller case is significant for anyone who maintains a public social media page by finding they can be liable for comments posted by others on that page even when they are unaware of those comments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F61ygY"&gt;The ruling may even effect individuals posting on personal social media pages, said Rolph in &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/media-outlets-lose-high-court-appeal-over-facebook-defamation-ruling-20210908-p58prh.html"&gt;comments to &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The decision “obviously has implications for ordinary users of social media platforms, because they can be held liable as publishers where they post material to their Facebook pages and encourage engagement,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD4MRW"&gt;Media companies argued that they could not be the publishers of Facebook comments as they were unaware of their content. “To be a publisher, one must intend to communicate the matter complained of,” they wrote in a submission from&lt;a href="https://cdn.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/08-Sydney/s236-2020/FairfaxMedia_NationwideNews_AustralianNews-Voller_App.pdf"&gt; February 2021&lt;/a&gt;. They also noted that at the time of the lawsuit, Facebook didn’t allow publishers to turn off comments underneath posts at all (the company &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/31/facebook-turn-off-comments-on-post-limit-restrict-disable-comment-posts-moderation-control-tool"&gt;only added this feature&lt;/a&gt; in March this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3wdf2"&gt;The High Court &lt;a href="https://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/downloadPdf/2021/HCA/27"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; by noting that when media companies created and maintained public Facebook pages they were showing their “intentional participation in the process” of sharing third-party comments. “[T]he appellants’ attempt to portray themselves as passive and unwitting victims of Facebook’s functionality has an air of unreality,” wrote two of the justices, Stephen Gageler and Michelle Gordon, in a judgement. “Having taken action to secure the commercial benefit of the Facebook functionality, the appellants bear the legal consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qm3kHy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;National regulations can have a global impact&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDP7Xg"&gt;A big question is what effect this ruling will have on the operations of media companies in other parts of the world. Thanks to the internet’s global reach, rulings in one nation can quickly have a knock-on effect internationally, and in the US, there are already huge debates about whether websites should be held liable for what users post (arguments which often revolve around the all-important &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K56tkB"&gt;It’s important also that Australia is often seen as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22332149/atlassian-ceo-scott-farquhar-interview-tech-regulation-internet"&gt;test bed for online regulation&lt;/a&gt;, able to enact sweeping changes that have a big effect on how companies operate online. Earlier this year, for example, the country’s competition watchdog &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;forced tech companies&lt;/a&gt; to pay Australian media companies to use their content, leading Facebook to briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;block all Australian users&lt;/a&gt; from sharing news articles on the site. In this particular case, the law &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22287971/australia-facebook-news-ban-google-money"&gt;was later changed&lt;/a&gt; and old functionality resumed, but it demonstrates how quickly what we think of as the normal operating standards of the internet can be altered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jTIoA"&gt;With this High Court ruling, comment sections in Australia may simply be seen as too costly to moderate and so turned off for good. However, &lt;a href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2021/australia/a-national-reset-begins"&gt;recent changes to de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediawrites.law/a-national-reset-begins-defamation-law-reforms-come-into-effect-in-nsw-victoria-and-south-australia/"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2021/australia/a-national-reset-begins"&gt;amation law &lt;/a&gt;in the country, which came into effect in some states on July 1st, have raised the barrier for defamation suits, and could potentially act as a counterweight to the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota says it’s investing $13.6B in car batteries over the next decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SJCC3LGMHVKCumVEiHZO32IyQnA=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828778/20210419_01_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyota’s electric BZ4X SUV concept.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Toyota&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vHJuns"&gt;Toyota will invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech over the next decade, including a $9 billion investment in production, as it attempts to electrify its vehicle lineup, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-to-spend-9-billion-on-electric-car-battery-plants-11631020016?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It reportedly plans to have 10 battery production lines by 2025, eventually increasing to around 70 across an unannounced number of factories around the world. Eventually, it could produce as much as 200GWh of batteries, the company’s chief technology officer, Masahiko Maeda, announced in a &lt;a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35971839.html"&gt;press briefing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTKYz0"&gt;Toyota’s commitments mirror similar investments planned by others across the auto industry. Volkwagen plans to produce around 240GWh of batteries in Europe alone by 2030, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"&gt;Ford has said&lt;/a&gt; it plans to produce 240GWh globally by then, including 140GWh in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4kB4S"&gt;It’s a big investment from Toyota, and indicates the world’s largest car manufacturer by volume is getting more serious about electrifying its lineup. Although the company was an early leader in gas-electric hybrid cars with the Prius, it reportedly viewed hybrids as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toyota-whiffed-on-electric-vehicles-now-trying-slow-their-rise/"&gt;stopgap measure&lt;/a&gt; until hydrogen fuel cells became competitive. Now, the company is playing catch-up with the likes of Nissan, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594235/toyota-lobbying-dc-ev-congress-biden-donation"&gt;reportedly lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to slow the US’s transition to electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZICnG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We aim to reduce the battery cost per vehicle by 50 percent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iczbRt"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;Toyota announced an electric vehicle strategy&lt;/a&gt; that will see it release 70 electric cars globally by 2025, including 15 fully-electric vehicles as well as hybrids and hydrogen-powered models. As part of the strategy it announced the BZ4X concept electric SUV, which it hopes to release in China and Japan starting later this year. By 2030, the company wants around 80 percent of its cars to include some kind of battery power, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOhmnR"&gt;Toyota hopes that its investments can help to reduce the cost of batteries by 30 percent thanks to improvements in materials and cell designs. On the vehicle side it’s also aiming to develop cars that use batteries more efficiently, resulting in 30 percent less energy consumed per kilometer. “Through this integrated development of vehicles and batteries, we aim to reduce the battery cost per vehicle by 50 percent compared to the Toyota BZ4X in the second half of the 2020s,” Maeda said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nagAf"&gt;The company is also continuing its work on solid-state batteries, which could eventually lead to more densely packed, safer, and faster charging cells, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-spend-over-135-bln-ev-batteries-by-2030-2021-09-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. Toyota hopes to begin manufacturing these batteries by the middle of the decade, but admits there’s still research to be done to improve the cost and lifespan of the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IeVpO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCqc4D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMXQfd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new dock is designed for a work from home world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rE3vGpasovXPCkk531ttmN49vbw=/151x0:1780x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828769/High_Resolution_PNG_Logi_Dock_Desktop_Enviro_Graphite_FRONT.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pTCtVj"&gt;Logitech is announcing a new all-in-one dock that’s designed for the new realities of a post-pandemic hybrid workforce. “When the pandemic hit, we spent an incredible amount of time with our end users to understand their needs and pain points in a work-from-home world. The result was Logi Dock,” says Scott Wharton, general manager and vice president of Logitech video collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbDmjw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fpersonal-workspaces%2Flogi-dock.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F8%2F22662237%2Flogitech-logi-dock-features-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The $399 Logi Dock&lt;/a&gt; lets you connect up to five USB devices and up to two monitors, all while charging a laptop with a single cable connection. The dock itself is a giant speaker, because it’s also designed with meetings in mind. There are meeting controls on the Logi Dock that let you quickly mute or disable video in Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. Logitech has even included a built-in noise-cancelling speakerphone that makes it easy to join meetings without having to use a separate dedicated microphone or headset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-R-1TOs6uPxgalJ6u1oRUi47Vww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833864/High_Resolution_PNG_Logi_Dock_FRONT_Graphite_lighting___Purple.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Logi Dock has meeting controls on top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DssNrt"&gt;Logi Dock will also integrate into your calendar, thanks to Logitech’s Logi Tune software. If a meeting is about to start, the Logi Dock will light up to let you know, and you can join just by tapping the dock. If you’re not using the Logi Dock for meetings, you can also use it as a speaker for your PC or any Bluetooth-enabled device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndf4jp"&gt;The Logi Dock includes two USB-A 3.0 ports at the rear, alongside two USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a DisplayPort, a HDMI port, USB-C upstream, a Kensington lock slot, and a Bluetooth pairing button. At the side there’s also a USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGhn67"&gt;Logitech’s Logi Dock &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fpersonal-workspaces%2Flogi-dock.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F8%2F22662237%2Flogitech-logi-dock-features-pricing-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will be available&lt;/a&gt; in both graphite and white options this winter for $399.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Clipchamp acquisition will help improve video editing on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8yDsfxmE-NdaFYxuQTDRYDfSwQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828694/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YJmpiW"&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Clipchamp, a browser-based video editing tool, and is hinting that it will be a great fit for Windows. Founded in 2013, Clipchamp lets people create and edit videos in a browser and utilize the full power of a GPU to render the final result. Clipchamp is used by companies like Google, Dell, and Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITTcEM"&gt;Microsoft is now looking to integrate Clipchamp into its Microsoft 365 offerings, and perhaps even Windows itself. “As a web app that uses the full power of your PC, Clipchamp is a natural fit to extend the cloud-powered productivity experiences in Microsoft 365 for individuals, families, schools, and businesses,” explains Chris Pratley, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Office media group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uNPpTY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft says Clipchamp is a great fit for Windows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyeBWb"&gt;Interestingly, Pratley also says “it’s a great fit for Microsoft Windows,” which suggests that Microsoft could integrate Clipchamp into Windows in the future. Clipchamp already exists as an app in the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft’s existing video editing tools for Windows are lackluster to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJLCPg"&gt;Windows 11 may improve that situation, alongside the potential Clipchamp integration in the future. Windows and devices chief Panos Panay teased a new photos app for Windows 11 just minutes before the acquisition announcement, with what looks like better tools for editing photos and videos. The existing photos app in Windows 10 can edit videos, but the tools are very basic, and aren’t even close to the level of editing options available in Clipchamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q3ZCHu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pumped to share another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Windows11&lt;/a&gt; first look with you - the beautifully redesigned &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PhotosApp?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PhotosApp&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsInsiders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsInsiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hraNJAo9iF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hraNJAo9iF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Panos Panay (@panos_panay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1435346853365575680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1DNpyw"&gt;Clipchamp uses a combination of templates and a library of filters, transitions, stock media, and styles to let people created videos with multi-track audio support and user-friendly editing. Microsoft’s acquisition appears to be part of the company’s renewed focus on creation, and even consumer-friendly apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D58J3Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628689/microsoft-manik-gupta-hire-uber-consumer-teams-skype-groupme"&gt;Microsoft recently hired a former Uber exec&lt;/a&gt; to lead a consumer apps effort inside the company, months after CEO Satya Nadella said “the next 10 years is going to be as much about creation as it is about consumption and about the community around it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is coming to parts of Europe on October 26th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oPcrax"&gt;HBO Max will launch in Europe next month on October 26th, the streaming service announced today. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, and Andorra are the first six countries it’ll be available in, before it expands to the following 14 territories next year: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2khb8v"&gt;The list of territories corresponds to the regions currently covered by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO_Europe"&gt;HBO Europe&lt;/a&gt;, which operates a handful of different streaming services on the continent including HBO España, HBO Nordic, and HBO Go. The company has previously said it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;transition its European HBO-branded services&lt;/a&gt; to HBO Max over the course of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="16o7Zx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Larger markets like the UK, Italy, France, and Germany are absent from the list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CDXPKP"&gt;Notably absent from the list are larger markets like the UK, Italy, France, and Germany. HBO has historically not operated standalone services in these countries, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-europe-rollout-plan-nordics-spain-1235005773/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, but has instead opted to license its content to local operators like Comcast-owned Sky in the UK. HBO says that “additional territory launches are also planned for next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsRuRe"&gt;“WarnerMedia movies and series like &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; are passionately consumed by fans all across Europe,” said Head of HBO Max International Johannes Larcher. “HBO Max has been created to provide them with the most intuitive and convenient viewing experience to watch these and a diverse range of other amazing titles.” HBO Max currently includes content from Warner Bros., HBO, DC, and Cartoon Network, as well as new content branded as Max Originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu0ZYB"&gt;HBO Max debuted in the US in May last year. In June, the streaming service launched across &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/6/29/22556006/hbo-max-launches-in-39-international-markets-outside-us"&gt;39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9jRih"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t mention how much European customers can expect to pay for the streaming service. Instead, that information will be announced in a virtual launch event planned for next month, HBO says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo is rebooting its Chromebook Duet with a 13.3-inch OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user sits in pajamas on a bed with a bright window in the background, using the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 in tablet mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRNXA78KOAj9mY2C6dz_kSEUdSY=/320x0:3770x2300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828394/Lenovo_Chromebook_Duet_5_Storm_Grey_relax.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Chromebook Duet 5 in “storm grey.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DteUJf"&gt;Over a year after it was unveiled, Lenovo’s category-defining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; is getting a sequel. The Chromebook Duet 5 (branded as the IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook outside of North America) is a head-to-toe reimagining of the detachable budget-oriented Duet, with a higher price, a new processor, and — most interestingly — a 13.3-inch OLED screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qctM3H"&gt;Lenovo says the Duet 5 is likely the first of multiple additions to the Duet line, in an ambitious effort to bring the detachable form factor to multiple price points. The company will continue selling the 10.1-inch Duet (for the time being). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vQQDdJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 2-in-1 Chrome OS tablet with a detachable keyboard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXxFil"&gt;The new OLED display covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, Lenovo says, and will emit “70 percent less blue light” than an LCD panel would, with the goal of delivering “incredible entertainment experiences.” OLED has long been a luxury signifier in the PC space, and with a starting price of $429.99, the Duet 5 will undoubtedly be one of the most affordable laptops ever to feature this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX5q1l"&gt;This Chromebook is part of a wave of thin and light OLED laptops recently unveiled across the industry. Lenovo has also added Windows-powered OLED models to its IdeaPad line, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652549/asus-proart-studiobook-16-pro-oled-vivobook-expertbook"&gt;Asus has outfitted&lt;/a&gt; a number of its consumer and enterprise lines (including its budget-oriented VivoBook and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652934/asus-zenbook-14x-oled-laptop-ultraportable-notebook-samsung-screen-display"&gt;ultraportable ZenBook&lt;/a&gt;) with the technology. The OLED craze isn’t out of thin air; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;Samsung (the world’s largest OLED vendor) announced in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would begin mass-producing laptop-sized 90Hz OLED screens this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Duet in laptop mode, seen from above on a white background with the stylus perpendicular to the right side of the panel. The screen displays the Chrome OS launcher." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsHeB8Fwa0lK3TV6mUIxCpWx_qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831666/Lenovo_Chromebook_Duet_5_Abyss_Blue_Slim_Light.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in “abyss blue.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zo7M2A"&gt;The Chromebook Duet 5 will be powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 compute platform&lt;/a&gt;, announced in May. This chip is designed for entry-level laptops and recently appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22466164/samsung-galaxy-book-go-laptop-windows-arm-snapdragon-price-specs"&gt;Samsung’s $349 Galaxy Book Go&lt;/a&gt;. Reviewers have found &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-book-go-review/#GalaxyBookGoPerf"&gt;that to be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Book-Go-in-review-Silent-office-notebook.555454.0.html"&gt;a bit slow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-book-go"&gt;so far&lt;/a&gt;, but Chrome OS is less demanding to run than Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ6vZe"&gt;The detachable form factor, most popularly associated with Microsoft’s Surface Pro devices, has appeared on a variety of laptop lines this year. Asus now sells the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;, a direct (albeit more expensive) competitor to the Duet with a built-in stylus garage and a kickstand that folds both vertically and horizontally. On the very opposite end of the price spectrum is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620111/hp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;HP’s $1,629 Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt;, also powered by a Snapdragon processor (but running Windows and covered in leather). Earlier this year, Lenovo tried the form factor in an X-Series ThinkPad with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt;, packing a beefier Intel Core i5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lq9i3P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Chromebook Duet 5 will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 compute platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObQGl4"&gt;Still, much of what made the original Duet such an attractive purchase was the combination of its low price, portability, and outstanding battery life. (We got well over 11 hours of continuous work in our testing.) The Duet 5 is heavier than the smaller Duet and significantly more expensive. (The predecessor starts at $279.) The Duet 5 has a different processor from the Duet and a screen that’s traditionally more power-hungry, so battery life is a question mark. (Lenovo’s most recent attempt at an OLED detachable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;, had some... problems in that area.) A 13.3-inch OLED screen is certainly a neat prospect, but whether it’s a good value will be another story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOBkDS"&gt;The Chromebook Duet 5 is expected to be available in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon is the lightest 14-inch laptop with an OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user sits on a couch in sweatpants and a flannel, seen from the side, typing on an IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M6mpzYnoKGTuic8I4RE34xM7BKY=/390x0:4611x2814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828391/Lenovo_IdeaPad_Slim_7_Carbon_AMD_14in_stilllife.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typing away on the IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Y6zv1"&gt;Joining an army of OLED laptops that have launched this month is Lenovo’s new IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon (branded as the Yoga Slim 7 Carbon outside of North America). Lenovo claims it’s the lightest 14-inch OLED laptop on the market at 2.37 pounds. (I’m guessing the company is right. The closest competitor I can think of is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652934/asus-zenbook-14x-oled-laptop-ultraportable-notebook-samsung-screen-display"&gt;Asus’ ZenBook 14X OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which is 3.09 pounds. It’s also lighter than both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbZVAN"&gt;One thing to note is that the OLED panel (from Samsung Display) comes with QHD+ resolution, rather than the 4K resolution that you often see on OLED laptops. This means you won’t get as many pixels as you would on a 4K OLED machine (like the ZenBook 14X), but you may also see better battery life. QHD+ is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features"&gt;still plenty sharp&lt;/a&gt;, especially at this size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uljNqU"&gt;There are other things to like about the display, too. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which will afford more vertical space than the 16:9 panel on last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21423498/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-2020-amd-review"&gt;IdeaPad Slim 7&lt;/a&gt;. Lenovo says it has a 90Hz refresh rate (a hallmark that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;Samsung promised&lt;/a&gt; would appear on more OLED laptops this year), will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and will reach 600 nits of brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon open on a white background, facing left. The screen displays two windowed apps on a black and purple background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mNUoelQg-YfHrMTmHA3N8OWdzk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832700/Lenovo_IdeaPad_Slim_7_Carbon_AMD_14in_Front_Facing_Left.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made from carbon fiber and magnesium alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VmNJ3F"&gt;Inside, the Slim 7 can be configured with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 5800U, an Nvidia GeForce MX450 graphics card, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. There’s a 61Whr battery that Lenovo claims will last up to 14.5 hours — which may seem like a tall order, but we got close to that out of last year’s Slim 7, which had a slightly smaller battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYdRz3"&gt;Lenovo also insists the thing is durable, despite its light build. Per the company, the device has undergone “nine operational tests” for durability, and can withstand “everyday physical shock and harsh environmental conditions.” It’s expected to hit shelves in October with a starting price of $1,289.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard of the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro seen from above on a white background. The screen displays a few windowed apps on an orange background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3UljSnaFO8DXSCr5gSiCNO3_020=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832517/IdeaPad__Slim_7_Pro_Storm_Grey_Hero_Keyboard.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Yoga Slim 7 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PcOVLQ"&gt;Lenovo also showed off a new Yoga Slim 7 Pro (branded as the IdeaPad Slim 7 Pro outside North America — I know, it’s confusing). This is a 16-inch laptop with a regular IPS touchscreen rather than an OLED, though it’s also 16:10 and has QHD resolution. That screen goes up to 120Hz, an even bigger boon for the gaming crowd. Models come with up to a Ryzen 7 5800H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. There’s a 75Whr battery. The Slim 7 Pro is expected in October with a starting price of $1,449. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pY246y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing an official ‘soft block’ feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uNJWo-NC3zB2hn8dHoMJUxb8v38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69827768/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDiYBL"&gt;Twitter has begun testing the first of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654061/twitter-features-archive-old-tweets-hide-likes-remove-followers-plans"&gt;proposed suite of new privacy tools&lt;/a&gt;: the ability to remove a follower without blocking them. The remove follower feature is currently being tested on the web and seems to canonize the “soft block” concept as an official Twitter tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niIQoB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435323978734841857?s=20"&gt;According to the tweet announcing the test&lt;/a&gt;, you can remove followers from the follower list on your profile page. You just click the three-dot menu next to a follower’s name, click “Remove follower,” and your tweets will no longer automatically show up in their timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUV-giTqpT4jbY42l3zMge5GH7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832668/followerRemoval2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remove follower option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6A7e47"&gt;This is different than &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/blocking-and-unblocking-accounts"&gt;blocking someone&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps them from viewing your tweets and direct messaging you (and keeps you from doing the same with them). Twitter’s new remove follower feature is more of a remote unfollow button, a gentler way to create some distance between you and someone else on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PmTm2"&gt;Previously, to have someone unfollow you without their knowledge, you could do a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-soft-block-on-twitter#:~:text=To%20soft%20block%20someone%2C%20you,t%20appear%20to%20be%20blocked."&gt;“soft block,”&lt;/a&gt; which is when you manually blocked and unblocked someone. Followers you remove then have to refollow you to see your tweets on their timeline, and if you have &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets"&gt;protected tweets&lt;/a&gt; (aka private tweets, only viewable by your followers), they’d need your approval to become a follower again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjSnpr"&gt;Testing similar functionality as an official Twitter feature is an admission that it could probably be easier and that people could benefit from it. It’s also yet another case of Twitter making the habits of its users official features, just like &lt;a href="https://qz.com/135149/the-first-ever-hashtag-reply-and-retweet-as-twitter-users-invented-them/"&gt;the @reply, hashtag, and retweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JogUDV"&gt;An even better solution might be more granular control over who can see your tweets at the point of tweet conception — Twitter is considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558731/twitter-trusted-friends-facets-features-pre-announce"&gt;an Instagram-like “Close Friends” option&lt;/a&gt; — but for now, easily and quietly pruning your follower list will have to do. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tripwire CEO out 53 hours after tweeting his opinions on Texas abortion law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NTKkQceU4M8irOIk5IpDyGMvPL4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69827424/d70494e0_963b_11ea_b479_2d2989941d85_ManeaterLaunchScreen2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tripwire Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="giAsa9"&gt;John Gibson, CEO of Tripwire Interactive — the studio known for making horror games like &lt;em&gt;Killing Floor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/5/22/21266348/maneater-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maneater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — was made to step down a blisteringly quick 53 hours after he tweeted in favor of the controversial Texas abortion law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFswgk"&gt;In the tweet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RammJaeger/status/1434245886670901250"&gt;Gibson says&lt;/a&gt;, “Proud of&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USSupremeCourt?src=hashtag_click"&gt; #USSupremeCourt&lt;/a&gt; affirming the Texas law banning abortion for babies with a heartbeat. As an entertainer I don’t get political often. Yet with so many vocal peers on the other side of this issue, I felt it was important to go on the record as a pro-life game developer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCABeB"&gt;The tweet drew sharp criticisms from across the gaming industry with many consumers stating they would no longer buy Tripwire games and sharing how to block the developer from showing up in Steam recommendations. Detractors also noted that Gibson’s pro-life opinion wasn’t the problem but that he chose to voice it publicly in his capacity as a CEO and in support of a law that essentially offers $10,000 bounties on abortion seekers and the people who help them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zF4Tn"&gt;The Texas law, known as &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961"&gt;SB 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/health/texas-abortion-law-facts.html"&gt;bans abortion&lt;/a&gt; when a “fetal heartbeat” is detected. While the term “fetal heartbeat” is not medical in nature, the phrasing of the law effectively bans abortion around six weeks into the pregnancy, which can be before a person even knows they are pregnant. A critical component of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033202132/texas-abortion-ban-what-happens-next"&gt;law deputizes private citizens&lt;/a&gt;, not the state, to enforce it, granting people the ability to sue abortion providers and anyone accused of abetting abortion seekers. For any person who wins such a suit, they can be awarded $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yob66U"&gt;Gibson tweeted his support for the law on September 4th. The next day, Shipwright Studios, a co-development services studio, tweeted that they would be canceling any contracts they had with Tripwire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eaOMS"&gt;“We cannot in good conscience continue to work with Tripwire under the current leadership structure,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shipwrightstdio/status/1434609166560202754"&gt;Shipwright Studios wrote&lt;/a&gt; a mere 24 hours after Gibson’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHJBni"&gt;By September 6th, Tripwire announced that Gibson would be stepping down as CEO, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8toNo"&gt;“His comments disregarded the values of our whole team, our partners and much of our broader community,” &lt;a href="https://www.tripwireinteractive.com/#/news/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-alan-wilson"&gt;Tripwire wrote on their website&lt;/a&gt;. “Our leadership team at Tripwire are deeply sorry and are unified in our commitment to take swift action and to foster a more positive environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUuYSN"&gt;Alan Wilson will replace Gibson as interim CEO. It is unknown if Gibson will continue to be employed by Tripwire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV1UQc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UclEP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s monthly prices increase by $1 as Disney pushes its streaming bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZvQWmAPZBSWRc8YBsvUH4Hguwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69827049/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yI15ID"&gt;Hulu’s streaming plans cost $1 more starting on October 8th, with its ad-supported tier going up to $6.99 each month and its ad-free tier going up to $12.99 monthly. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hulu-price-increase-streaming-plans-1235057717/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the price of Hulu’s live TV service, which also includes access to its streaming content, isn’t increasing. Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117502/hulu-ceo-randy-freer-disney-plus-kevin-mayer-dtc-espn-marvel-studios"&gt;the majority owner of Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, has increased the prices of its other streaming services over the past year, making its bundle that includes all of them look more and more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zLgZe"&gt;The price of the Disney bundle, which includes Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus, doesn’t appear to be going up along with Hulu’s prices — however, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;already went up by a dollar&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;Disney Plus got a $1 per month price hike&lt;/a&gt;. It currently costs $13.99 per month for a version with ad-supported Hulu and $19.99 a month for ad-free Hulu. If you want all the services, the bundle is a good deal — it’ll save you almost $8 a month versus buying the services separately (after the Hulu price change) whether you go with the ad or ad-free plans. Disney’s CEO &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hulu-price-increase-streaming-plans-1235057717/"&gt;has reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; that the company is pushing the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5e5M8j"&gt;For those who had existing Hulu subscriptions before signing up to the Disney Bundle, billing is handled by &lt;a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&amp;amp;sys_kb_id=fe020c3edbb12c1032f7c28d13961906#i"&gt;charging the regular price for Hulu&lt;/a&gt; then giving the user a discount on their Disney Plus subscription. Hulu’s support Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824"&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the price of the Disney Bundle will not change due to the price increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UoSK4t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey there, Justin! No — the Disney Bundle and Live TV plan prices will not change as a result of the above price changes. Let us know if you have any other questions!&lt;/p&gt;— Hulu Support (@hulu_support) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTpEzc"&gt;Hulu hasn’t been resting on its laurels since its last price increase, though. In recent months, subscribers have gotten access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639273/hulu-hdr-original-shows-movies-4k-picture-quality"&gt;HDR for some original shows and movies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;a Watch Party feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets friends watch shows together. Whether these features and the content available on the service add up to something worth $7 or $13 a month will be up to you, but come October, that’s the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;
