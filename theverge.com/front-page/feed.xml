    <title>New video of Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus shows thin bezels around a flat display </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mO2Ijmjo7XNWNK_NEI3QZOZVlqQ=/0x202:804x738/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68506381/random_stuff_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lf3p_1m4NE&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=RandomStuff2" target="_blank"&gt;Random Stuff 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dvjok6"&gt;Plenty of details about the Samsung Galaxy S21 have already leaked ahead of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;expected January release&lt;/a&gt; date. But a new video gives a glimpse of the Galaxy S21 Plus model, showing a flat display with thin bezels around it, and a punch hole selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcZkfw"&gt;The quality of the video from user Random Stuff 2 isn’t the greatest, and it has some sort of distracting music playing under the user’s commentary. It also doesn’t provide a lot of detail about the back of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G4nOBU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Lf3p_1m4NE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9QMXn"&gt;Three Galaxy S21 models are expected: a standard, a Plus and an Ultra. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;series of leaked teaser trailers&lt;/a&gt;, showed off redesigned camera bumps, showing what appears to be five cameras on the S21 Ultra and three each on the S21 and S21 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijk7mf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that the S21 will have a 6.2-inch display, the Plus will be 6.7 inches and the Ultra will have a 6.8-inch display. The phones will all have batteries ranging in size from 4,000 mAh to 5,000 mAh, and all three are expected to have either a Snapdragon 875 or Exynos 2100 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGFdvd"&gt;The phones are all expected to have 5G, with the S21 and Plus both with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1, and Wi-Fi 6E in the Ultra. The S21 Ultra is also expected to be compatible with Samsung’s S-Pen, but rumor has it the S-Pen won’t be sold with the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8VmCs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXAShG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4yA2e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oracle moves its HQ from California to Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oracle stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgj8J5DRODVG-zBBBWQI2mY-LK0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68505909/acastro_201002_1777_googleVsOracle_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vy8b8W"&gt;Software giant Oracle moved the company headquarters from Redwood City, California to Austin, Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/oracle-moves-headquarters-to-texas-joins-exodus-from-california"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, the latest tech firm to depart Silicon Valley for the Lone Star State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqcuIu"&gt;Oracle did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/oracle-is-moving-its-headquarters-from-silicon-valley-to-austin-texas.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was putting into place “a more flexible employee work location policy,” and that the move to Austin would “best position Oracle for growth and provide our personnel with more flexibility about where and how they work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujBwyf"&gt;Oracle, founded in 1977, is one of the older Valley tech firms, and is a staple of the area; the San Francisco Giants play at Oracle Park, and the company’s Redwood City campus features its well-known cylindrical buildings. It already has a campus in Austin, which it opened in 2018. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott heralded the news in a tweet, saying “Texas is truly the land of business, jobs, and opportunity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4geq5K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: Oracle just announced they have moved their Headquarters to Austin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Texas is truly the land of business, jobs, and opportunity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will continue to attract the very best.&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1337518818013405190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HrUs5k"&gt;Several other firms have announced plans to leave California in recent months, with some company leaders blaming the state’s political climate as unfriendly to business. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y"&gt;Tesla is building a new plant&lt;/a&gt; near Austin and CEO Elon Musk has threatened to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;move the company out of California&lt;/a&gt; altogether after tussling with local officials over coronavirus lockdowns, but Tesla still has a plant in Fremont. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;Musk said he moved his personal residence&lt;/a&gt; to Texas, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akkROG"&gt;And another Silicon Valley company, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-california-greg-abbott-texas-1ce5ef41c6e20e84b5954de11fa3c8a7"&gt;Hewlett Packard Enterprise, announced plans&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month to build a 440,000-square-foot campus in a Houston suburb for its new headquarters. HPE already has Texas locations in Austin and Plano, near Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMQMIo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeQExg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDHqb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KP7G9F"&gt;Workers at an iPhone production plant in India reportedly smashed windows and set fire to vehicles to protest reductions in pay, the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/violence-breaks-out-at-wistron-corps-iphone-manufacturing-plant-near-bengaluru/articleshow/79691511.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The incidents began Saturday at a facility run by Taiwan manufacturing company Wistron Corporation, where the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/24/iphone-se-assembled-in-india/"&gt; iPhone SE is assembled.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIUGQr"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/angry-at-delayed-payments-employees-ransack-narsapura-plant-where-iphones-are-made-7102392/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Express&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; during a shift change workers who said they had seen their pay reduced damaged the offices, some furniture, and factory equipment before things escalated outside. A local official told the &lt;em&gt;Express &lt;/em&gt;that police were investigating the incident. About 2,000 workers were involved in the protest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla will reportedly suspend production of its Model S and Model X for 18 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8WtiJA4gtFAQRsPaLCt417MWXqA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68505062/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;Tesla will shut down production for its Model S and Model X for 18 days beginning December 24th according to an internal memo, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/12/tesla-model-s-and-x-production-will-shut-down-for-18-days-email.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; Why and what the company will do with the two lines during the shutdown wasn’t immediately clear, but workers on those production lines will apparently get a week’s pay, some paid holidays, and will have opportunities to work on other teams within the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9TmJd"&gt;The memo also says the workers can volunteer to help with delivery of vehicles to customers while production is on hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2SQx7"&gt;Auto industry analyst &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tweetermeyer/status/1337904510551773187?s=21"&gt;Edward Niedermeyer noted&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla asked California for tax exemptions in 2015 for equipment it needed to build 195,000 Model S and Model X vehicles by 2021. &lt;a href="https://dailykanban.com/2016/09/08/tesla-plans-long-term-expansion-model-s-model-x-capacity/"&gt;The company told the state of California&lt;/a&gt; at the time it would expand its production capabilities in anticipation of producing “approximately 118,000 additional Model S and X vehicles per year,” in addition to its projected annual rate of approximately 77,000 Model S and X vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lchfKL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;In the third quarter of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla produced 145,000 vehicles and delivered 139,300. Of that number, Tesla produced just under 17,000 Model S and X vehicles, delivering 15,200 of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKgKJ3"&gt;Tesla is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y"&gt;building its next factory in Austin&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, and CEO Elon Musk has threatened to move all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;Tesla production out of California&lt;/a&gt;. He confirmed he has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;relocated his personal residence&lt;/a&gt; from California to Texas, a move predicted to save him millions in taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGRkTW"&gt;In a separate email to employees Friday, Musk said demand for Tesla vehicles has been “quite a bit higher than production this quarter,” and urged employees to increase production as much as possible, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-12/musk-calls-on-tesla-workers-to-boost-output-through-end-of-year?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. “Please send me a note directly if you see ways to improve output, but feel that your voice is not being heard,” he wrote in the email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SqOea"&gt;During Tesla’s October battery day event, the company said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498558/tesla-q3-2020-vehicle-delivery-numbers-record-breaking"&gt;expected to deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. But by that point, the company had sent 318,350 cars to customers, so it will need to deliver more than 181,000 vehicles before the end of the year to hit its target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gunokV"&gt;Tesla did not respond to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaY4F7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzd919"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Which celebrity should be the face of the COVID-19 vaccine?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elvis Presley receiving a polio vaccination from Dr. Leona B" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSLQL8IPgSaK98Sbt_1HgmdPZjE=/0x290:4862x3531/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68504889/585208158.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Seymour Wally/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUd4mW"&gt;In 1956, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/24/elvis-presley-polio-vaccine-world-immunisation-week"&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt; got a polio vaccination on the&lt;em&gt; Ed Sullivan Show&lt;/em&gt;. The shot was newly available and highly effective — but too few teenagers and young adults were getting vaccinated, so the devastating disease was still circulating. Officials turned to Presley to set an example and encourage people to get their shots. Along with other campaigns, the celebrity endorsement helped vaccination rates go up, and eventually, the disease was eliminated from the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aC3DrC"&gt;That bit of history raises a very important question: who will be the Elvis Presley of the COVID-19 vaccine? The vaccine won’t help slow the pandemic if people don’t take it, and many people still say they &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/"&gt;aren’t sure&lt;/a&gt; if they will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z4oki"&gt;Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/politics/obama-vaccine/index.html"&gt;already said&lt;/a&gt; they’ll take the vaccine in public, as did &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/11/world/covid-19-coronavirus#to-build-confidence-fauci-says-hell-get-vaccinated-publicly"&gt;Anthony Fauci&lt;/a&gt;, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That’s a great start — but for an unprecedented vaccination campaign, we probably need more famous people on board. Celebrities can’t be the only way officials encourage people to roll up their sleeves (vaccine communication is complicated!), but it might help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjntui"&gt;Here’s who &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers think should get vaccinated in public.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Queen, Duke Of Edinburgh, Prince Of Wales &amp;amp;amp; Duchess Of Cornwall Visit Poundbury" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BIguhYxhTlRYSDBhcROkOmYp-To=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22163428/618569182.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Samir Hussein / WireImage&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CAsjz0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/strong&gt; - She is literally the queen. This won’t mean much to anyone with even the smallest anti-authoritarian leaning, but for many from a certain generation, Queen Elizabeth represents an uncomplicated bygone era where a stiff upper lip was all you needed to get through the toughest of hardships. Broadcasting her vaccination would send a powerful message, not least about the safety of the vaccine. Broadcast it anywhere where viewership trends older, like traditional broadcast channels. — &lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7Zg5q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donald Fagen of Steely Dan&lt;/strong&gt; - I’ll start with the obvious: Donald Fagen is not a beloved or even particularly famous pop star. But at 72, Fagen is at the forefront of the generation most at risk for COVID-19, and he still holds a powerful sway over his age cohort. He’s also a known conservative and a longstanding skeptic of grand paternalist schemes — exactly the kind of person vaccine developers need to win over. If inoculating Fagen can get the vast silent majority of Steely Dan aficionados on board, it could be a huge service to public health. — &lt;em&gt;Russell Brandom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iHpCPK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Donald Fagen is not a beloved or even particularly famous pop star&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pNA88"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/strong&gt; — There’s no one group that defines the anti-vaxxer. But rich, white people are &lt;a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/rich-white-and-refusing-vaccinations/"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; than most to decline vaccines for their children. A few years back, they made headlines for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/17/too-rich-sick-disneyland-measles-outbreak-reflects-anti-vaccination-trend"&gt;skipping measles vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, which came to light after an outbreak of the highly contagious disease at Disneyland. They might be inclined to trust Paltrow, patron saint of wellness and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/13/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-selling-a-candle-that-smells-like-her-vagina-goop"&gt;vagina candles&lt;/a&gt;. If she throws Goop’s support behind COVID-19 vaccinations, she might be able to get this group on board. — &lt;em&gt;Nicole Wetsman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvr8tq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oprah Winfrey - &lt;/strong&gt;The “wine moms” our pop culture mostly ignores are &lt;em&gt;hugely important&lt;/em&gt;: they tend to be influential in their families and communities. Oprah has made an entire career out of cultivating these women — it’s part of the reason why she’s such an icon. You want everyone vaccinated? Have Oprah do it live, on television, as part of a special. The opportunities here are endless: you can bring on musical guests, who play a song or two and then &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;get vaccinated. You can have an interview with a major cultural icon who talks about how they have personally been affected by the pandemic (Tom Hanks, anyone?). And maybe, since Oprah is famous for her giveaways, there’s a segment where Oprah gives either an in-studio audience the vaccine or where she travels around the country vaccinating fans. It would be must-watch television — and if the adoption rates of the books and consumer products Oprah champions are any indication, we’ll have the vaccinations done in no time. —&lt;em&gt; Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mqDVp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dolly Parton — &lt;/strong&gt;Dolly is having a major 2020. She was introduced to a new audience of fans thanks to the Twins the New Trend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEPFYiJOXU&amp;amp;ab_channel=TwinsthenewTrend"&gt;review of her 1973 hit “Jolene,”&lt;/a&gt; and her $1 million donation to Vanderbilt University &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/18/dolly-parton-moderna-vaccine-abumrad-covid/"&gt;helped fund Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. She’s a longtime supporter of philanthropic causes: she’s raised money for wildfire relief, HIV-AIDS research, and a cancer hospital. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/1333645538328076288"&gt;President Obama recently admitted&lt;/a&gt; he screwed up by not giving Dolly a Medal of Freedom while he was in office. Despite her fame and business acumen, Dolly’s unpretentious, homey image and humble beginnings make her the perfect person to reassure people across many demographics about taking a vaccine; after all, Dolly’s already on board with it. — &lt;em&gt;Kim Lyons &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eicRAH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taylor Swift &lt;/strong&gt;— Prior to the 2018 midterm elections, Taylor Swift made an Instagram post urging her fans to vote for Tennessee Democratic candidates. At that time, the singer rarely discussed politics publicly and hadn’t waded into the 2016 election (it was the same summer as her Snapchat scandal). But she chose the right moment to break her silence: the post appeared to lead to a &lt;a href="https://time.com/5419276/taylor-swift-instagram-post-voter-registration-spike/"&gt;sharp rise in voter registrations&lt;/a&gt; among young people. As a celebrity with such a massive, young, and ardent following, you can probably only make so many public statements like this before your more apolitical fans start tuning it out. But Swift’s base still seems to be listening to her, and a vaccination over Instagram live could be what we need to send young people out in droves. She could even write a song about it! — &lt;em&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1vF03"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kim Kardashian / the Kardashian family —&lt;/strong&gt; Encourage people to keep up with the Kardashians by getting vaccinated. Then, everyone can go to Kim’s 41st birthday party on a private island! — &lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FGbkEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;keep up with the Kardashians by getting vaccinated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2RCsM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desus and Mero&lt;/strong&gt; — Hosts of late-night talk shows appeal to a large audience of America. Of the many entertainers of the genre, Desus and Mero are the most down-to-earth of the bunch. They know how to talk to an audience and they understand the internet and pop culture more than any other on television. Their strength in communicating would easily illustrate how relieved you should feel that a vaccine is here. — &lt;em&gt;Andru Marino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyt76S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy — &lt;/strong&gt;If this is going to be a televised event, a reunion is what drives numbers on TV today. The cast of &lt;em&gt;Blue Collar Comedy Tour&lt;/em&gt; was marketed as four guys speaking from an everyday American perspective. They may appeal to a crowd that may be skeptical of a vaccine, and bringing lighthearted comedy into the situation can ease over some tensions. Also, they could reunite on Desus and Mero’s show. — &lt;em&gt;Andru Marino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gLz8HU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late-night TV hosts — &lt;/strong&gt;Whether you watch the likes of Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, Lilly Singh, Jimmy Kimmel, or Conan O’Brien regularly — or at all — it’s tough to deny their influence in pop culture. Having each of them volunteer to get a vaccine during a show, perhaps looping in celebrity guests to also take part, would be a great way to boost trust in the vaccine, cast over public access TV channels that anyone can freely view in the US online or with an antenna. — &lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37uJ6j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Lowe — &lt;/strong&gt;Rob Lowe is one of our generation’s most lovable pop culture icons; and thanks to his ever presence on primetime television, we’ve all had dinner with him at one point or another. He is like a national comfort blanket. Plus, those in their 50s and 60s begin to be at a higher risk of COVID-19 and will need to get vaccinated early on in this process. Although seemingly ageless, Rob Lowe is actually 56 and a perfect example of how right things can go for someone if they take their health seriously. Plus, whose mom doesn’t love Rob Lowe? — &lt;em&gt;Esther Cohen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds more AR animals to mobile Search and most of them are pretty cute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFhYKvSkm3UZzH1AxSJTCrsZ5SE=/0x149:1061x856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68503089/scary_giant_ar_cat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giant AR cat is giant&lt;/em&gt; | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTGiNQ"&gt;Google has added 50 new augmented reality animals to Search which can be either cute, or in the case of the giant cat in the photo above, a bit disconcerting. Of course it’s possible that I find the giant kitty menacing because I hate fun (or so I have been told), but I do not think I want that creature to greet me, anywhere, ever, in AR or any other reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIcvMh"&gt;I do, however, want this red panda to play with a pumpkin in my dining room as long as she wants to. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P6cOo3WAytDE6Us4n7Uj92FGhOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22165276/red_panda.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Kim Lyons/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look how cute she is with her little pumpkin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2avxY8"&gt;In addition to the red panda and cat, there’s a giraffe, cow, zebra, pig, and hippo among the new creatures you can welcome virtually into your home (or other space, but we’re all homebound right now). Just search for an animal on Google’s mobile app and tap “view in 3D” among the results. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/11/google-opens-the-door-for-50-new-ar-animals-to-jump-into-your-living-room/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;has a pretty good list&lt;/a&gt; of all the AR animals they’ve discovered so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9e43Xi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hip(po), hip(po), hooray!   There are 50 new AR animals to discover on Search. Search for your favorite animal on your Google mobile app, tap "View in 3D" to see them in your space and don’t forget to share your best creations with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Google3D?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Google3D&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/u80Mn7wi1z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/u80Mn7wi1z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google (@Google) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1337506620612485120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rtqe0A"&gt;When Google started putting 3D animals in Search last year it only had a few standard animals available like a tiger, a lion, a wolf, and a dog. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18649312/google-ar-search-results-animals-3d-model-augmented-reality-lions-tigers-bears-oh-my"&gt;added more creatures in March&lt;/a&gt;, including alligators, ducks, and hedgehogs. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400577/google-arts-and-culture-augmented-reality-prehistoric-creatures-museum-exhibits"&gt;Google made prehistoric creatures&lt;/a&gt; and historical artifacts available in AR via its Arts and Culture app— and who among us wouldn’t love to check out the ancient crustacean &lt;a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/QwGIdPc45fzOug"&gt;Cambropachycope&lt;/a&gt; up close and personal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="901gAX"&gt;I have to admit after playing with the AR animals in Search for a bit (in the name of research, obviously), it’s a pretty fun feature, and is likely to be very fun for kids stuck inside during — everything. Now, off to watch my new pet red panda wrestle with her pumpkin. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The RestoMod is a limited-edition retro-looking PC with a fake floppy drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yEc2DXwnadAMNo_Mt0iHi9BeGcY=/0x0:1405x937/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68502825/restomod.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origin made its RestoMod PC to look like a throwback&lt;/em&gt; | Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FUqw44"&gt;Origin has made a new, limited edition PC that has the guts of a new model but the face of an ancient 1990s machine, complete with a fake floppy drive. In case you want some nostalgia while you wait for &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt; to load, perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuV4UQ"&gt;The RestoMod has a custom Corsair 4000D case, and the &lt;a href="https://www.originpc.com/configurator/neuron-resto-mod/"&gt;standard build&lt;/a&gt; has 16GB of memory, a 2.9 GHz Core i5 processor, 250GB of storage, and a 6GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card, for $2,080. The RetroMod can be customized as desired, Origin says, but they’ve only made 50 of them, so supplies are limited. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QP6-FGhpPm5fZiyIL7nrx5FjU9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22165119/restomod2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;RestoMod: New but with an old look&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yg38Ix"&gt;The front face of the machine is where you’ll get the old-school feel, Origin says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WR3MWc"&gt;By using a custom HD UV print on the steel front panel, the RestoMod PC features a custom design inspired by PCs from the 1990s. The buttons and drives are just for looks, but you can always pretend that the Turbo button gives you that extra boost in performance. To complete the look, the RestoMod PC chassis has been painted in a matching beige color to accentuate how cases back in the day preferred simplicity over color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Jrkk1D"&gt;It’s a little disappointing that the Turbo button isn’t functional somehow, but this PC is all about its image: old and sorta dingy. Of course, for a limited run of only 50 machines it seems like Origin could have sourced some actual retro parts, like old disc drives, rather than what’s essentially a fun, but cosmetic paint job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlPbXL"&gt;If you find the beige faux face of the RetroMod comforting, head over to &lt;a href="https://www.originpc.com/configurator/neuron-resto-mod/"&gt;Origin’s website &lt;/a&gt;to configure your new, but old, PC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verge Weekender: Disney’s big day, Cyberpunk 2077, latest at Google, and our favorite gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBaRdCSUO5UiwA8jPrh6u3wm-co=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68502313/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="94r8lj"&gt;Happy Saturday and welcome to the inaugural edition of the Verge Weekender, a short recap of some of the stories we covered this week on &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6c7QJ"&gt;The big event of the week was Disney’s investor day, where the company announced new Disney Plus series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168373/wandavision-trailer-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showed trailers for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;much-anticipated series&lt;em&gt; Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; as well as slew of new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; series on Disney Plus, including &lt;em&gt;Rangers of the New Republic, Ahsoka, Obi-Wan Kenobi, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Lando. &lt;/em&gt;There’s also a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168623/alien-tv-show-noah-hawley-legion-fargo-fx-disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien &lt;/em&gt;TV&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; in the works. Check out the full roundup of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;everything Disney announced at its 2020 Investor Day&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUC2bT"&gt;Perhaps the biggest news of the week/year/pandemic hit late Friday, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;FDA approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for emergency use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yVpeQ9"&gt;The vaccine is authorized in the US for people over the age of 16. It was found to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;95 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in clinical trials. “That is extraordinary,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1333146966985908224"&gt;said in a press conference&lt;/a&gt; at the end of November. It’s far better than experts had dared hope for. The FDA was prepared to authorize a vaccine as long as it was at least 50 percent effective. “We were shocked,” Pfizer’s chief executive officer, Albert Bourla, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/21/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We couldn’t believe it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ekcfgy"&gt;Here’s what else went down over the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9hW6Vv"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed how the company handled the departure of AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TScRsd"&gt;“We need to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily,” Pichai wrote in an email to staff. He added that the company would consider “de-escalation strategies” in the future. In response, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1336758639785365506"&gt;Gebru tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Pichai’s email wasn’t an apology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8szGFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; Gebru tweeted that Google had abruptly fired her after she voiced her frustration over how the company had handled a &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;research paper on the risks of large language processing models&lt;/a&gt;, and Google’s head of AI, Jeff Dean, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;published a note&lt;/a&gt; explaining that Gebru’s paper hadn’t met company standards. Her own team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158501/timnit-gebru-team-google-public-statement-fired"&gt;pushed back, writing that Google&lt;/a&gt; had applied its publication review policy “unevenly and discriminatorily.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AWK4lS"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 finally debuts after nearly a decade in development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JPWb0U"&gt;The long-awaited game from CD Projekt Red &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; to generally favorable reviews. But reports of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;bugs from users on older consoles&lt;/a&gt; put into doubt whether developers who helped make the game would earn their performance bonuses. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;company announced Friday&lt;/a&gt; it would pay devs full bonuses regardless of the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/cyberpunk-2077"&gt;critical reception&lt;/a&gt;. It also said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;removing some flashing-light sequences&lt;/a&gt; in the game to reduce the potential for inducing seizures for some users.&lt;/p&gt;

It disputed the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;story, calling the allegations it hosted child sex abuse material “irresponsible and flagrantly untrue.” But on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168240/mastercard-ending-pornhub-payment-processing-unlawful-videos"&gt;Visa and Mastercard both said they would stop processing payments&lt;/a&gt; on the site as they conducted their own separate investigations. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic aborts first powered spaceflight from New Mexico spaceport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-vknPqrRCneKsnLqbdckPAQLCw=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68502175/VP01_2_Gliding_Home__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity gliding home during a previous test flight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Virgin Galactic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3CwBc"&gt;This morning, Richard Branson’s space tourism company Virgin Galactic had to abort its first powered test flight of its spaceplane from the company’s home in New Mexico, bringing the vehicle home before it could reach space. During the flight, the spaceplane’s engine cut out too early and the vehicle’s two pilots had to glide back down to the ground early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TH2MVI"&gt;The aborted engine ignition was caught live &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dasvaldez"&gt;by a Twitch livestream&lt;/a&gt; provided by the outlet &lt;a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/"&gt;NASASpaceflight&lt;/a&gt;. The video showed the spaceplane, called VSS Unity, dropping away from its carrier aircraft in mid-air as planned. The vehicle then briefly ignited its main engine, according to the video, but the ignition cut out after just a moment. On a typical flight, the spaceplane’s engine will stay ignited for a full minute, propelling the vehicle to the edge of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XIybsK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the ignition cut out after just a moment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ehgmju"&gt;Once the engine cut out, VSS Unity turned into a glider and returned to its launch site in New Mexico. The company confirmed that VSS Unity landed safely on a runway after the abort, and the flight’s two pilots, C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1337800691075723266"&gt;made it “back safe and sound&lt;/a&gt;.” No passengers were on board this flight, though the vehicle was carrying a number of microgravity payloads for NASA. Virgin Galactic suggested it may replace the engine motor in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bZugZ9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Early update on flight: The ignition sequence for the rocket motor did not complete.  Vehicle and crew are in great shape. We have several motors ready at Spaceport America. We will check the vehicle and be back to flight soon.&lt;/p&gt;— Virgin Galactic (@virgingalactic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1337802669482782720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hCbne9"&gt;Today’s flight was meant to be the third time that Virgin Galactic sent VSS Unity to space and back. The previous two test flights, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18138279/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceshiptwo-space-tourism"&gt;conducted in late 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18232354/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceplane-test-spaceflight-passenger-beth-moses"&gt;early 2019&lt;/a&gt;, took place out of the company’s test facility at the Mojave Air and Spaceport out of California. After those last tests, Virgin Galactic moved its operations to the company’s new, primary home, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;a glittering facility known as Spaceport America in the New Mexico desert&lt;/a&gt;. It’s from this facility that Virgin Galactic plans to conduct all of its commercial tourist flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuukbT"&gt;While Virgin Galactic has conducted a few glide flights of VSS Unity from the spaceport before, the vehicle has yet to reach space from the facility. This flight was meant to be an important step as the company prepares to send its first passengers to space on VSS Unity from Spaceport America. With 600 initial customers signed up for flights, Virgin Galactic hopes to start flying commercial passengers for the first time in 2021. Branson, the company’s founder, is supposed to take his first flight next year, kicking off commercial operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ZTXeJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With today’s abort, it’s unclear how Virgin Galactic will proceed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8VvOSE"&gt;With today’s abort, it’s unclear how Virgin Galactic will proceed. If this flight had been a success, Virgin Galactic planned to conduct one more powered test flight before Branson took to the skies. The next flight would have included two test pilots, as well as a “full cabin of mission specialists,” according to the company. Virgin Galactic already flew its first test passenger, Beth Moses, on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18232354/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceplane-test-spaceflight-passenger-beth-moses"&gt;second spaceflight in February of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But the company has yet to fly a full cabin on one of these trips. It’s possible that Virgin Galactic may opt to perform a do-over of today’s test first, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KIUzr"&gt;To get to space, VSS Unity actually takes off in mid-air. A giant carrier aircraft called VMS Eve transports the spaceplane, with its pilots in the cockpit, to a starting altitude of 50,000 feet. From there, VSS Unity falls away and the pilots ignite the vehicle’s main engine, initiating the climb to space. Eventually, the engine shuts off and the passengers on board experience a few minutes of weightlessness, while seeing the curvature of the Earth. To get back home, the pilots then shift the wings on VSS Unity and reenter Earth’s atmosphere, gliding back to the ground and landing on a runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxejtC"&gt;Virgin Galactic had hoped to fly this test a few weeks earlier, but had to delay after new COVID-19 restrictions were introduced in New Mexico. The company said that today’s flight was “conducted under strict COVID-19 protocols with only essential personnel onsite.” No guests or members of the press were allowed to witness the flight from the spaceport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFfNNQ"&gt;Once commercial operations begin, Virgin Galactic’s flights will include two test pilots and eventually up to six passengers in the crew cabin. Before they fly, passengers will spend up to three days training at Spaceport America before riding on VSS Unity. The first 600 passengers set to fly with the company have each paid $250,000 for their tickets, though Virgin Galactic claims those prices will change over time. The company also plans to reopen ticket sales sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RRAis"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter briefly restricts Trump’s disputed election tweets </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwpu0eqX_k42vGa_5kXxQ9pUElI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68501890/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TTdXYq"&gt;It looked like Twitter was adding further restrictions to President Trump’s Twitter account on Saturday, as some users noticed the ability to like, retweet or reply to his tweets with “disputed” labels was not working. Copying the URL to one of the disputed tweets also appeared to be disabled, and quote-tweets were not appearing in search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqRaBB"&gt;Some users were able to access and like Trump’s tweets — several &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers confirmed they could engage with “disputed” tweets by clicking through the warning label— but others on Twitter could not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vZu1RU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;OK Based on my probing, for Trumps election fraud tweets:&lt;br&gt;- like, RT, reply, copy URL actions are disabled&lt;br&gt;- all counts disabled&lt;br&gt;- quote tweets allowed, if you click through warning &lt;br&gt;- maybe most importantly: QTs undiscoverable. No visible semantic connections. No search. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Fh7Xg5O5fg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Fh7Xg5O5fg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan D Pants (@sixfoot6) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1337757680388120578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMT9EF"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that the platform “inadvertently took action to limit engagements,” on Trump’s tweet and had since reversed the action. Tweets that violate Twitter’s  &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/election-integrity-policy"&gt;Civic Integrity Policy&lt;/a&gt; “will continue to be labeled in order to give more context for anyone who might see the Tweet,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXO5Bq"&gt;Twitter began applying &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-changes.html"&gt;“disputed” and other warning labels&lt;/a&gt; to tweets containing election misinformation ahead of the November 3rd US presidential election, and restricting engagement with those tweets. It announced that Tweets with premature claims of victory would be labeled, tweets intended to incite interference in the election or election results could be removed, and tweets from political figures with more than 100,000 followers — which includes President Trump — which receive a “misleading” label will be more difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLhVBg"&gt;Since the presidential race was called for Joe Biden, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552471/trump-twitter-restricted-false-election-claims-moderation"&gt;President Trump has tweeted numerous falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; about the election, stoking conspiracy theories that it was “rigged,” and claiming there was widespread fraud, without citing evidence. On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1337745268591259648?s=20"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “I WON THE ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE, but remember, I only think in terms of legal votes, not all of the fake voters and fraud that miraculously floated in from everywhere! What a disgrace!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6l4sg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-texas-election-trump/2020/12/11/bf462f22-3bc6-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html"&gt;The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request &lt;/a&gt;from the attorney general of Texas seeking to overturn election results in four key states, the latest unsuccessful attempt by the president and his team to try to change the election results in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4XsYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
