    <title>Twitter makes small changes to direct messages </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WF13pHjAoE7dD5i1Ob-i_cW2TM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69750176/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is making some small updates to its direct messages | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Q2Xw4"&gt;Twitter on Thursday said it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408769835421701?s=20"&gt;introducing several new updates &lt;/a&gt;to its direct messages, which will roll out to some users in the next few weeks. The changes include the ability to send a direct message to multiple people in separate conversations because who among us has not accidentally started a group chat that way. Now, you can share a tweet in up to 20 separate DM conversations, if the goss is hot enough to share with that many individual tweeters at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAt1D0"&gt;The feature is coming to the iOS and web versions of Twitter first, and Android “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tnfQlk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;No more (awkward) accidental group chats when you DM a Tweet to multiple people. Now you can share the same Tweet in up to 20 different DM convos, separately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rolling out on iOS and web, and soon on Android. (2/5) &lt;a href="https://t.co/oHYseF3EJE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oHYseF3EJE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408781239504898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7ITNh"&gt;For iOS users, Twitter is tweaking DM timestamps; now instead of stamping each message within a DM conversation with the date and time, the&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408787245928453?s=20"&gt; messages will be grouped by day&lt;/a&gt;. This will reduce “timestamp clutter,” Twitter says. And, iOS users will soon be able to access the “add reaction” buttons not only by double-tapping but by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408786126057484?s=20"&gt;long-pressing on a message&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqzy3R"&gt;Android users, sorry, but you’ll be waiting to access those last two features, although you will get the ability along with iOS users to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408784981004290?s=20"&gt;quick-scroll through a DM conversation&lt;/a&gt; and return to the most recent message by pressing a down-arrow button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpiLY6"&gt;Twitter has added many new features in the past several months, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629097/twitter-misinformation-health-covid19-reporting-feature-white-house"&gt;new process to report COVID misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, an update to its API to make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631036/twitter-spaces-developers-api-v2"&gt;other apps to point to its Spaces&lt;/a&gt; audio chats, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620438/twitter-changes-font-chirp-design-icon"&gt;change to its font&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the new DM features, on Thursday Twitter also announced it was testing a feature that would make it easier for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632414/twitter-newsletter-subscription-button-revue-profile"&gt;users to subscribe to Twitter users’ Revue newsletters &lt;/a&gt;directly from a Twitter profile. That’s rolling out to web and Android users to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzl7RT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Policy groups request Apple abandon plans to scan devices for child abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSXBPBTPSMgp9m4g8l2fX1ML5tw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749739/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Policy groups have asked Apple to abandon plans to scan iPhones for images of abuse | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwiiC4"&gt;An international coalition of policy and civil rights groups published an open letter Thursday asking Apple to “abandon its recently announced plans to build surveillance capabilities into iPhones, iPads and other Apple products.” The groups include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Access Now, Privacy International, and the Tor Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UopXV"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple announced its plans &lt;/a&gt;to use new tech within iOS to detect potential child abuse imagery with the goal of limiting the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. Apple also announced a new “communication safety” feature, which will use on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in its Messages app. Parents of children age 12 and younger can be notified if the child views or sends such an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Vimb"&gt;“Though these capabilities are intended to protect children and to reduce the spread of child sexual abuse material, we are concerned that they will be used to censor protected speech, threaten the privacy and security of people around the world, and have disastrous consequences for many children,” the groups wrote in &lt;a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYhVGE"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632722%2Fapple-child-abuse-scan-ios-abandon-request-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new “Child Safety” page&lt;/a&gt; details the plans, which call for on-device scanning before an image is backed up in iCloud. The scanning does not occur until a file is being backed up to iCloud, and Apple says it only receives data about a match if the cryptographic vouchers (uploaded to iCloud along with the image) for an account meet a threshold of matching known CSAM. Apple and other cloud email providers have used hash systems to scan for CSAM sent via email, but the new program would apply the same scans to images stored in iCloud, even if the user never shares or sends them to anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g4EOs7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RJIEhX"&gt;In response to concerns about how the technology might be misused, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple followed up by saying&lt;/a&gt; it would limit its use to detecting CSAM “and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBqYM0"&gt;Much of the pushback against the new measures has been focused on the device-scanning feature, but the civil rights and privacy groups said the plan to blur nudity in children’s iMessages could potentially put children in danger and will break iMessage’s end-to-end encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKP6zM"&gt;“Once this backdoor feature is built in, governments could compel Apple to extend notification to other accounts, and to detect images that are objectionable for reasons other than being sexually explicit,” the letter states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvN7IH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vine’s creator is now working on NFT blockchain video games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj9E4jRQSEJUJa-ixyTjdaS2eZY=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749526/E9GaIKBXEAM03sE.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just try not reading it as “SuperDrive.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Supdrive on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ejBTrP"&gt;Dom Hofmann, one of Vine’s founders and the creator of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18076362/vine-successor-byte-launch-dom-hofmann"&gt;Byte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228466/peach-social-network-microblogging-down-but-is-coming-back"&gt;Peach&lt;/a&gt;, has a new project called Supdrive. In his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1428093313412915203?s=20"&gt;tweet announcing Supdrive&lt;/a&gt;, he calls it an “on-chain fantasy game console,” which doesn’t necessarily make it any more obvious as to what this project will look like. He’s since explained in an announcement post, which you can read below, that it’ll be a video game console that plays classic-style games (in the vein of &lt;em&gt;Pacman&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Asteroid&lt;/em&gt;), with NFTs acting as a sort of virtual cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGwmHD"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supdrive/status/1428102398850093057?s=20"&gt;a Discord set up for Supdrive&lt;/a&gt;, Hofmann wrote that the games will be NFTs, running on virtual firmware. The fact that games will be released as NFTs means that there will only be so many “editions” or copies available. Hofmann also says that each copy of a given game will be unique, with players getting different color palettes, difficulty levels, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="Przsxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each copy of a given game will be unique in some ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="BX7Le5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9zwh4B"&gt;Hofmann compares Supdrive to another blockchain project, &lt;a href="https://artblocks.io/learn"&gt;Art Blocks&lt;/a&gt;, while describing it, which may give us an idea of what it’ll actually be like. The gist of Art Blocks is that it lets creators make programs to procedurally generate art, which is then stored on the blockchain. The programs will always create the same art for a given seed, but changing the seed changes what the art ends up looking like (&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; players may be familiar with this sort of system). Then, people buy NFTs for an Art Block project, which will contain a seed, letting them generate that art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfh2IS"&gt;This seems to fit well with what Hofmann is describing, where an on-chain console will play unique games. The details, though, like how exactly it will work, how many copies of each game will be available, and how much they’ll cost, are all to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mtCA4P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many details about the Supdrive are still to be announced&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Rp7Fl"&gt;Hofmann’s post does say that the plan is to let the community develop games for the Supdrive, if the project ends up working out. He also plans on upgrading the console’s abilities, allowing for more advanced games (the initial set of games will be “old-school arcade style”). The first game, made by Hofmann, is called &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZu3nY"&gt;Supdrive also has a sort of meta game, with its users being split up into &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-esque Red, Green, and Blue teams. Hofmann’s announcement post says that which team you’re on  could have an effect on the game you’re playing. For now, though, the different color teams are mostly memeing at each other in the Discord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Conversation between two Discord users. User 1: When’s the release? Hofmann: Shooting for Oct, will share more details soon. Will prob have some leads activities. Should be something special (smile emoji)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1BYqwEL72rYrm7QGXluX-X2I9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22793195/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_11.30.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hofmann saying that the goal for Supdrive’s release is October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ysv49z"&gt;In the Discord chat, Hofmann said he was aiming for an October launch for the project. He’s also said that he’ll be doing updates “every week or so” leading up to the launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrP8Z4"&gt;Hofmann’s post-Vine projects haven’t managed to reach the original video platform’s success — the iOS app for his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/8/10739010/peach-cool-social-network"&gt;social network, Peach&lt;/a&gt;, hasn’t been updated in three years, and the successor to Vine, Byte, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250926/clash-buys-byte-vine-successor-dom-hofmann"&gt;purchased by a TikTok competitor called Clash&lt;/a&gt; (and user App Store reviews have not been positive about the changes made). Only time will tell how Supdrive turns out, but it does seem to be an interesting idea — if you’re willing to enter the NFT market to get the games, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wG4GG"&gt;The full Supdrive announcement, posted to Discord:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uYXbAI"&gt;SUP? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zjn0hX"&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Update #1&lt;/strong&gt; — will do these every week or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMkEhi"&gt;This project has gotten more attention than I expected in the first 12 hours so I wanted to share a few more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pu2ELw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Supdrive?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmZGGX"&gt;Supdrive is an on-chain fantasy console where &lt;strong&gt;the games themselves are NFTs&lt;/strong&gt;. You can think of it sort of like Artblocks for games. These games all run on the Supdrive Virtual Firmware, a toolkit that allows games to be written in concise instructions that are gas friendly and ideal for on-chain storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9XtGR"&gt;Although every game will be released in fixed edition sizes, &lt;strong&gt;every edition is unique&lt;/strong&gt; — every version of the game will be different, whether it’s color palettes, difficulty, special abilities, or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTo2W5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of games?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bW2uNa"&gt;Supdrive games will be old-school arcade style games to start. Think titles like Galaga, Pacman, or Asteroid. As the firmware is upgraded, games will gradually become more sophisticated. Perhaps one day we’ll have Super Supdrive or Supdrive 64.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjgwbG"&gt;The first game is called &lt;strong&gt;Origin&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NokE9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s making the games?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZzum6"&gt;I will be developing the first few games, but if things go well the plan is to open up the platform. Artblocks is another good example here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hxi6Qr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Red Green Blue teams?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Am7q03"&gt;Inspired by Pokemon, teams are an ongoing meta system in the Supdrive world. In the future, you will have an opportunity to commit to your team and receive a free airdrop collectible that signifies you membership in the team. Holding this collectible will have effects in certain Supdrive titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H43I96"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mint price/edition size/release date?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbNTgz"&gt;TBD and will keep you posted  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsQowc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I help?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJLS8s"&gt;For now, just hanging out in the Discord and raising awareness is cool. As we get closer to launch, there will be more things to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTgiys"&gt;— &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXtSOA"&gt;That’s it for now! See you next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Go read this story of a leaker who ‘worked’ as a double agent for Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jRNdlGG8dCkzuHbyA_Fs4juZ4K4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749434/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuXhhK"&gt;Apple products are often leaked because they’re immensely popular, the company is protective of its plans, and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7en78/9to5mac-writer-paid-source-dollar500-in-bitcoin-for-stolen-apple-data"&gt;people are willing to pay&lt;/a&gt; for just about any information on a new product. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqyz8/apples-double-agent"&gt;A new must-read report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that not everyone selling Apple leaks is on the up-and-up, and not because of the information they’re peddling. Some leakers are working for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrmrp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai spoke to a double agent named Andrey Shumeyko, an Apple leaker who began offering information to the company in 2017. By the time 2020 rolled around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267590/ios-14-leaked-early-version-internet-months-vice"&gt;and iOS 14 leaked&lt;/a&gt;, Shumeyko was actively trying to become Apple’s mole, tracking leaked hardware and software and sharing it with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15837522/apple-internal-presentation-leaks"&gt;Apple’s Global Security team&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of getting paid, and to “redeem himself for being part of that community.” There’s a reason why he spoke to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;in the first place, though. Apple never paid and “never took into consideration my side and me as a person,” Shumeyko tells &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uhar0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The mole got played&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1aYKxL"&gt;What’s interesting about Shumeyko’s story isn’t the fact that there are moles working within the communities selling Apple’s biggest secrets, it’s that Apple managed to keep Shumeyko  sharing information for almost a year. Hacking and ferreting out leaks can sometimes involve social engineering, manipulating people rather than the technical tools they use. It’s just unusual to see such a clear version of it working the other way, and not with a ton of complexity. In private messages, Apple appealed to Shumeyko’s interest in the company and his sense of guilt — and it worked, until it didn’t. Here’s what he says one Apple employee told him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QFk9b7"&gt;Please understand that our goal is to protect Apple. All our actions are guided by the premise of what is best for the company, our employees, and our customers (of which you are one). Therefore your help—and insights—in understanding possible threats to us are very important...Do the right things to protect Apple. Keep it that way, you will be proud of yourself, so will we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lZSPUx"&gt;You should read &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqyz8/apples-double-agent"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s full piece&lt;/a&gt; to learn about all the leaks Shumeyko was involved in, and the not-so-subtle ways Apple tried to manipulate him. For all the information that still made it out, Apple remains an intimidating company to mess with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Motorola Edge gets a 108-megapixel camera but ditches the edge display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGvwBZN9FIO3y82ldrGugAWgMx4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749378/edge.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9D1ly"&gt;Motorola has a new version of its $700 Edge smartphone, bringing better cameras, a more modern processor, and an updated design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUpRAK"&gt;As with last year’s Edge, the new model doesn’t quite offer the best hardware Android has to offer, with a Snapdragon 778 5G processor, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, or 8GB RAM / 256GB storage, but those sacrifices might be worth it for the decidedly midrange price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNbqBS"&gt;Despite that, the new Edge does feature the 108-megapixel camera that was one of the marquee features on the Edge Plus, along with a larger 5,000mAh battery and mmWave 5G — both of which were also offered on the Edge Plus but were downgraded to a 4,500mAh battery and sub-6GHz-only specs on last year’s Edge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPL4-EVXAsWWm3hWTNZ6aLNXNqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791020/Motorola_edge__2021__design.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gkzgT1"&gt;The display is a 6.8-inch LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, but calling the new phone the Edge (with no numbering to help distinguish it from the 2020 model) is actually a bit of a misnomer, given that the 2021 model ditches the “endless edge” waterfall display that gave the original Edge and Edge Plus their names. That said, given that the curved screen was by and large a gimmick on last year’s models, it’s not much of a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJSipX"&gt;Cameras are the aforementioned 108-megapixel main camera, along with an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide that offers Motorola’s “Macro Vision” feature, and a 2-megapixel depth camera. A 32-megapixel front-facing camera rounds out the proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlooYj"&gt;Still missing on the spec sheet is any form of wireless charging, although the new Edge does add some extremely basic IP52 water resistance (which, while better than nothing, is basically just enough to protect from the odd bit of rain). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2YQ4t2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Motorola debuts Edge 20 flagships globally with fast refresh screens and 108-megapixel cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kAPH4y"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same hardware as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599860/motorola-edge-20-pro-lite-camera-5g-global-launch"&gt;trio of Edge 20 models&lt;/a&gt; that Motorola released internationally earlier this summer (which, among other differences, feature smaller 6.7-inch displays) although it most closely resembles the middle-of-the-road Edge 20 in specs. The Edge 20 does beat the North American model Edge in a few areas, however: it features an 16-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 3x telephoto camera as its other two rear cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bytbmy"&gt;The latest version of the Edge is also definitively a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21347201/motorola-edge-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;last year’s regular Edge model&lt;/a&gt; — not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;premium flagship Edge Plus hardware&lt;/a&gt; that aimed to challenge high-end phones from Samsung and OnePlus. For now, there’s no word on Motorola as to whether it’ll be trying again at competing in the crowded high-end Android market in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="veVCeb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another “limited time” discount&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSXO30"&gt;Pricing for the 2021 Edge also matches last year: it’ll technically be sold for $699.99, but Motorola is once again offering a “limited-time” discount right from the start to drop the price down to a more wallet-friendly $499.99. The company isn’t saying how long that price will be offered at this time, although if it’s anything like last year, sales won’t be too hard to come by. It’ll be available in the US unlocked from sellers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola’s website, with carrier versions from Verizon and Spectrum mobile planned “in the coming months.” A release in Canada is also planned for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces price increase for Office 365 and Microsoft 365</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNlP0aQzKkCaMoIwB3D48bLMOb8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749355/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lLml0y"&gt;Microsoft is announcing its first price increase for its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 services in a decade. The price increases will affect commercial and business users of Microsoft’s software as a service (SaaS) offerings next year, with no changes to pricing for education or consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYkuJi"&gt;Microsoft’s updated pricing will go into effect on March 1st, 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wGyJEK"&gt;Microsoft 365 Business Basic (from $5 to $6 per user)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wi4TSv"&gt;Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from $20 to $22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6dmdIh"&gt;Office 365 E1 (from $8 to $10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="edXloD"&gt;Office 365 E3 (from $20 to $23)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aSTq8e"&gt;Office 365 E5 (from $35 to $38)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l4MiI3"&gt;Microsoft 365 E3 (from $32 to $36)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="egueXH"&gt;Microsoft first launched Office 365 in 2011 across 40 different markets, and the company has been improving it ever since. These price changes mark “the first substantive pricing update since we launched Office 365 a decade ago,” explains Microsoft 365 chief Jared Spataro &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2021%2F08%2F19%2Fnew-pricing-for-microsoft-365%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HoXkj"&gt;They also come as Microsoft has reported a record year of revenue growth thanks to cloud services like Office 365. Microsoft has more than 300 million paid seats for Office 365, so the price changes will certainly bump Microsoft’s profits and revenue even further next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktvnEH"&gt;While larger businesses will have benefited from bulk discounts and deals over the past decade, it’s the small businesses that will feel the effects of an increase in pricing as the economy starts to recover from a pandemic. Either way, Microsoft has added more than 20 apps to Office 365 since it originally launched, including Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, and To-Do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google gave phone makers extra money to ditch third-party app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeyzJWMk7qsaf45JgKUy8xZ5Ry0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749321/akrales_190326_3320_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GaX9Ha"&gt;Newly unredacted sections of Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;antitrust complaint against Google&lt;/a&gt; reveal new details on the lengths to which Google went to undermine third-party app stores on the Android platform. According to the new text, starting in 2019, Google ran a “Premier Device Program” that gave Android phone makers a greater share of search revenue than they would normally receive. In exchange, the OEMs agreed to ship their devices without any third-party app stores preinstalled. Specifically, they followed a rule that prohibited “apps with APK install privileges” without Google’s approval, leaving the Play Store as the only built-in digital marketplace for software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wurOxS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1428411904381304845"&gt;As noted by Leah Nylen&lt;/a&gt;, products that qualified as a Premier Device would receive a 12 percent share of Google search revenue compared to the 8 percent they’d normally earn. Google sweetened the deal further for companies like LG and Motorola, offering them between 3 and 6 percent of what customers spent in the Google Play Store on their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQ1Kv"&gt;“Google’s Premier Device Program was not publicly known, and was not known to Epic, before Google recently began producing relevant documents in this litigation,” Epic’s lawyers wrote in the complaint. “Google has sought to conceal its most restrictive anticompetitive conduct by, among other things, including in the agreements themselves a provision restricting signatories from making ‘any public statement regarding [the] Agreement without the other party’s prior written approval.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqEJpi"&gt;The complaint goes on to paint the Premier Devices Program as a resounding success that has only further solidified the Play Store’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VasOxh"&gt;By May 2020, many of the world’s largest and most popular Android OEMs had agreed to Google Play exclusivity for most of their new Android devices. Motorola and LG both committed nearly all (98 percent and 95 percent) of their devices to the Premier program. The giant Chinese conglomerate BBK — which manufactures and sells a range of Android devices under its Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus brands, among others, had designated around 70 percent of its new devices as “Premier.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hm6Lr7"&gt;Here’s where Epic goes into detail on the Premier Device Program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bRU6nc"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://www.documentcloud.org/embed/enhance.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KyFJGb"&gt;Other companies like Sony (50 percent) and Xiaomi (40 percent) weren’t as committed to the program. Still, Epic argues in its complaint that the program effectively tilted the scales against third-party stores on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9660h"&gt;Another newly public section of the complaint shows how rare it is for people to venture outside the Play Store’s walls. Epic says that an internal Google report from 2017 found that “app installations through channels other than Google Play (including direct downloads and competing app stores) amounted to a mere 4.4 percent of Android app downloads in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s ‘Project Hug’ paid out huge sums to keep game devs in the Play Store, Epic filing claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsnjAU9HiXs_Gw9OQU8xeAWFUg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749290/wjoel_180413_1777_android_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMnvO4"&gt;Google quietly paid game developers hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives to keep their games on the Play Store, a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.165.1.pdf"&gt;newly unredacted complaint&lt;/a&gt; from Epic Games in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;antitrust suit against Google&lt;/a&gt; alleges. The program was known as “Project Hug,” or later as the “Apps and Games Velocity Program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntG3a4"&gt;In 2018, when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; for Android first launched, Epic Games took the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17645982/epic-games-fortnite-android-version-bypass-google-play-store"&gt;unusual step of exclusively releasing&lt;/a&gt; it outside of the Google Play Store. Instead, players had to download an installer directly from Epic’s website, allowing the company to bypass Google’s 30 percent fee — at the cost of a less user-friendly installation process. Epic Games would eventually relent and release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229943/epic-games-fortnite-google-play-store-available-third-party-software"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the Play Store in April 2020&lt;/a&gt; (at least, until it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation"&gt;was removed again by Google&lt;/a&gt; after Epic added a feature allowing players to bypass Google’s fee when making in-app purchases, kicking off the current slate of lawsuits.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foFRrI"&gt;But Epic’s complaint alleges that Google was so concerned about the idea of other developers following &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s lead — and cutting it out of the lucrative business — that it launched a program called “Project Hug” to make sure that developers would stick with the Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mCiQL9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google was reportedly worried that other developers would follow Epic’s lead&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbm2Cl"&gt;According to the complaint, a 2019 report compiled by Google Play’s finance team raised concerns that Epic could arrange a deal with OEMs like Samsung to preinstall its competing store, winning over developers with promises of lower revenue splits (a tactic Epic uses with the PC-based version of its store) and helping pave the way for Android users to turn to other alternative storefronts. In total, the team estimated that the Epic Games Store on Android could result in a lost of between $350 million and $1.4 billion to Google by 2022; if other app stores like Amazon’s or Samsung’s “gained full traction” alongside Epic, those losses could grow from $1.1 billion to $6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agIQWI"&gt;Project Hug was designed as part of the effort to limit Epic’s influence, as “a hug developers close and show love plan,” or “a surge plan to throw extra love/promotion to top developers and games (including Tencent portfolio companies),” Android executives explained in internal documents. In practice, that translated in more practical terms to spending “hundreds of millions of dollars on secret deals with over 20 top developers” that the company had deemed most at risk of falling to Epic’s “contagion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NicuPn"&gt;Google’s documents note that, while many of the targeted developers had inquired about revenue share or considered their own distribution platforms, Project Hug was largely a success. By the end of 2020, Google had signed deals with most of its Project Hug targets — most notably Activision Blizzard — to keep them in the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xj8Jgd"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels commented that “Google Play competes with other app stores on Android devices and on rival operating systems for developer attention and business. We’ve long had &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/continuing-to-boost-developer-success.html"&gt;programs&lt;/a&gt; in place that support best-in-class developers with enhanced resources and investments to help them reach more customers across Google Play. These programs are a sign of healthy competition between operating systems and app stores and benefit developers tremendously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gob2s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 19th, 4:35pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Google statement. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s store-crashing GTA V freebie brought more than 7 million new users to its online marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGqjoBoa3WeSjqbRBM-lcxu0-z8=/57x0:3297x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749206/476_3840.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="focwv9"&gt;In May 2020, Epic Games offered &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; for free on the Epic Games Store, a deal that proved to be so popular it took down the store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;for more than eight hours&lt;/a&gt;. And thanks to documents discovered as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, we now have an idea of just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; popular the deal was: according to an internal Epic slide, it brought more than 7 million new users to Epic’s online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpW9z0"&gt;You can see the slide below, which also shows how many new users other freebies brought to the Epic Games Store. While other games like &lt;em&gt;Subnautica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Civilization 6 &lt;/em&gt;drove a good number of signups (just under 1 million and 2.5 million, respectively), nothing comes close to the 7 million people who joined for &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H14bnX"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImLIbD"&gt;But even though &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; brought a tidal wave of new users, the Epic Games Store still has a long way to go to catch up with its primary competitor, Steam. Epic revealed &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-self-publishing-closed-beta-opens-today"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that the Epic Games Store has 58 million monthly active users, but that’s a little less than half of the more than 120 million monthly active players that Valve &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/2961646623386540826"&gt;last reported are on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvRL9V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, Epic reported 56 million monthly active users &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which means that the platform has only jumped 2 million users since then. That’s a slower rate of growth than the store has seen in the past — by comparison, monthly active users jumped from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million in December 2020, or an average of 2 million monthly active users more &lt;em&gt;per month&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u17YJa"&gt;Despite the slower growth, Epic still seems very committed to its platform. Alongside the news of the platform’s 58 million monthly active users, Epic announced a closed beta for self-publishing on the Epic Games Store. When self-publishing is available to all, it might open the floodgates for more developers to host their games on Epic’s store, which could bring in new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i83Y0f"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;other documents from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; describe an Epic initiative called “Project Moonshot” with a goal of getting the Epic Games Store to $1 billion in gross revenue by investing in “major launches, free games, and key sale(s).” It seems likely we’ll continue to see big pushes from Epic like the &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; freebie and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18293453/borderlands-3-release-date-trailer-xbox-ps4-pc-epic-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3’s&lt;/em&gt; initial Epic Games Store PC exclusivity at launch&lt;/a&gt; (which Epic paid $146 million to secure, the documents reveal) to attract gamers to its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans to prohibit sexually explicit content beginning in October </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dSzrxwGxj92iIHuL5aoi-hHdyE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749152/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6qjUz"&gt;Video sharing site OnlyFans, best known for its creators’ adult videos and photos, will prohibit sexually explicit content starting October 1st. First &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it is making the changes because of pressure from its banking and payment provider partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcpuBo"&gt;“In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,” OnlyFans said in a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G7ho3"&gt;Creators on the platform will still be allowed to post nude images as long as they comply with the site’s &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt;. More information will be available in the coming days, the company added: “OnlyFans remains committed to the highest levels of safety and content moderation of any social platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uXlUB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnlyFans pushes SFW app on iOS and Android as it tries to shake adult image","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BIZYVI"&gt;OnlyFans claims more than 2 million creators — who it says have earned more than $5 billion on its platform — and 130 million users. Last year, the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"&gt;generated $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in sales (of which OnlyFans receives a 20 percent cut). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FUT9G"&gt;The company is seeking investors at a valuation of more than $1 billion but has had difficulty attracting investors, &lt;a href="http://axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html"&gt;according to a report from&lt;em&gt; Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because of the proliferation of porn on the site (&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; notes the company didn’t mention pornography at all in its pitch deck to investors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7A5uq7"&gt;Despite its ability to draw eyeballs, and the safer environment it provides sex workers, online porn is a hard sell for investors. Recall that as Verizon prepared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20804894/tumblr-acquisition-matt-mullenweg-ceo-automattic-wordpress-verizon-changes-vergecast"&gt;sell Tumblr to Automattic&lt;/a&gt;, the blogging site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;permanently banned adult content&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, a highly controversial move at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBrU92"&gt;Along with the announcement about sexually explicit content, OnlyFans published its first &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/transparency/july2021"&gt;monthly transparency report for July&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, “as part of our commitment to safety and transparency.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjjJbX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
