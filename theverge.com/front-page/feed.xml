    <title>An OpenSea bug let attackers snatch Apes from owners at six-figure discounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fsD8Vh"&gt;A bug in OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, has let hackers buy rare NFTs for well below market value, in some cases leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for the original owners — and hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits for the apparent thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPY739"&gt;The bug appears to have been present for weeks and seems to be referenced in at least one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carsonturner/status/1477414895834513413"&gt;tweet from January 1st, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. But exploitation of the bug has picked up significantly in the past day: blockchain analytics company Elliptic reported that in a 12-hour stretch before the morning of January 24th, it was exploited at least eight times to &lt;a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/bug-allows-nfts-worth-over-1-million-to-be-stolen"&gt;“steal” NFTs with a market value of over $1 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg3zd7"&gt;One of the NFTs, &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/9991"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club #9991&lt;/a&gt;, was purchased using the exploit technique for 0.77 ETH ($1,760) and quickly resold for 84.2 ETH ($192,400), netting the attacker a profit of more than $190,000. An &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1a22cc48f6784f629a994917cd6474923630c48#internaltx"&gt;Ethereum address&lt;/a&gt; linked to the reseller had received more than 400 ETH ($904,000) in payouts from OpenSea in the same 12-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCaXNE"&gt;“It’s a subjective thing whether you consider this to be a loophole or a bug, but the fact is that people are being forced into sales at a price they wouldn’t otherwise have accepted right now,” said Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQKnrY"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yakirrotem/status/1485559872242565121"&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; by software developer Rotem Yakir, the bug is caused by a mismatch between the information available in NFT smart contracts and the information presented by OpenSea’s user interface. Essentially, the attackers are taking advantage of old contracts that persist on the blockchain but are no longer present in the view provided by the OpenSea application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJXWCW"&gt;OpenSea users sell NFTs by setting a “list price” for potential buyers to see. Due to the nature of smart contracts, if a buyer accepts that list price, the NFT is automatically transferred to them. If an owner wants to re-list an NFT for a higher sale price, the proper way to do this is to cancel the first listing, which costs a “&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nft-investing-crypto-art-what-is-a-gas-fee-explained-2021-3"&gt;gas fee&lt;/a&gt;” that might be in the tens or even hundreds of dollars, so some users had skirted around this by transferring the NFT to another wallet, then back to the original wallet. While this technique apparently removed the listing from the information in OpenSea’s front-end display, the original listing remained active on the blockchain and could allegedly be found through the OpenSea API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsssZK"&gt;The bug was discovered as early as December 31st, 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/24/opensea-bug-allows-attacker-to-get-massive-discount-on-popular-nfts/"&gt;according to CoinDesk&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GinoTheGhost/status/1481461462350532609"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from almost two weeks ago on January 12th, 2022, details the forced sale of NFTs via the same method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqcSWO"&gt;It’s unclear whether OpenSea is treating the situation as an open security flaw or a result of user error. The company did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T’s new 5-gig and 2-gig fiber internet is here, starting at $110 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvlIWG6HpbO56w2vES3zlvcZmH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426119/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K66hn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/fastest-major-internet-provider.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is rolling out 2Gbps and 5Gbps&lt;/a&gt; speed tiers for its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/fiber/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fiber-optic internet option&lt;/a&gt;. The company made the announcement to kick off its Life Gigified event, where it said new and existing AT&amp;amp;T Fiber customers will soon be able to take advantage of these multi-gig connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrdTWF"&gt;If you don’t know what multi-gig is, it means a single connection that offers speeds higher than 1Gbps. AT&amp;amp;T’s new multi-gig speeds need Wi-Fi 6 technology for “optimal” performance, which means you’ll probably want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283756/arris-surfboard-max-pro-wi-fi-6-mesh-router-review-price-specs-features"&gt;upgrade your router&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, AT&amp;amp;T has a new “All-Fi” device ready. The company may offer even faster speeds eventually; AT&amp;amp;T says it reached speeds of 10Gbps in a lab environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="58w0YC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2Gbps plan will cost $110 / month, while the 5Gbps plan is priced at $180 / month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlytlu"&gt;The 2Gbps plan will cost $110 / month, while the 5Gbps plan is priced at $180 / month. Business plans will cost a bit more, however, at $225 / month for 2GB speeds and $395 / month for 5Gbps. AT&amp;amp;T is also introducing “straightforward pricing” for all of its Fiber plans, which it says will eliminate equipment fees, annual contracts, data caps, and 12-month price increases for new customers. Its new plans come with a free HBO Max subscription as well as &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ActiveArmor&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T’s cybersecurity service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBVu5e"&gt;These new speed tiers will be available in over 70 metro areas, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Dallas. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/gigapower/coverage-map/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offers its fiber-optic network&lt;/a&gt; near cities spread out across the Southern, Midwestern, and Western portions of the US, but it plans to expand its service network to 30 million customers by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftkfTK"&gt;Previously, AT&amp;amp;T’s fiber-optic speeds ranged from 300Mbps to 1Gbps. Its move into multi-gig territory follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437958/google-fiber-2-gig-gbps-internet-nashville-huntsville-speed-webpass-pilot"&gt;Google Fiber’s 2Gbps rollout&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 as well as Comcast’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Flearn%2Foffers%2Fdetails%3FofferId%3D9626100376&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F24%2F22898876%2Fatt-fiber-multi-gig-connections-speeds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;3Gbps offering for $299 / month&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T offers more information about the new speeds &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/http://att.com/hypergig" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta has built an AI supercomputer it says will be world’s fastest by end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Prineville Data Center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4yfABuwLxw9tquqNnqqVYvtQHA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426006/vpavic_160712_1138_0079.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zjq47W"&gt;Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBIDfC"&gt;“Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuL4ri"&gt;The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-uks-most-powerful-supercomputer-for-research-in-ai-and-healthcare"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CtlzOh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCVLel"&gt;“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more,” write Meta engineers Kevin Lee and Shubho Sengupta in a &lt;a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-rsc"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlining the news.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eX0LUU"&gt;“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kh1dn3acDYk80Wd5VxjAhSdX2Jg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23190900/Screenshot_2022_01_24_at_12.52.44.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meta’s AI supercomputer is due to be complete by mid-2022. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ov1Fvm"&gt;Work on RSC began a year and a half ago, with Meta’s engineers designing the machine’s various systems — cooling, power, networking, and cabling — entirely from scratch. Phase one of RSC is already up and running and consists of 760 Nvidia GGX A100 systems containing 6,080 connected GPUs (a type of processor that’s particularly good at tackling machine learning problems). Meta says it’s already providing up to 20 times improved performance on its standard machine vision research tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXtHuo"&gt;Before the end of 2022, though, phase two of RSC will be complete. At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BoVox"&gt;These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReRvQH"&gt;The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oOh1FR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI supercomputers and regular supercomputers can’t necessarily be compared apples to apples&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qONUmH"&gt;The brief explanation is that machine learning requires less accuracy than the tasks put to traditional supercomputers, and so “AI supercomputers” (a bit of recent branding) can carry out more calculations per second than their regular brethren using the same hardware. That means when Meta says it’s built the “world’s fastest &lt;em&gt;AI&lt;/em&gt; supercomputer,” it’s not necessarily a direct comparison to the supercomputers you often see in the news (rankings of which are compiled by the independent &lt;a href="http://Top500.org"&gt;Top500.org&lt;/a&gt; and published twice a year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maU7Ic"&gt;To explain this a little more, you need to know that both supercomputers and AI supercomputers make calculations using what is known as floating-point arithmetic — a mathematical shorthand that’s extremely useful for making calculations using very large and very small numbers (the “floating point” in question is the decimal point, which “floats” between significant figures). The degree of accuracy deployed in floating-point calculations can be adjusted based on different formats, and the speed of most supercomputers is calculated using what are known as 64-bit floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs. However, because AI calculations require less accuracy, AI supercomputers are often measured in 32-bit or even 16-bit FLOPs. That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqCDdJ"&gt;Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eCHLi"&gt;In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reportedly suspends reservations of its Maverick hybrid pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LnojzGmBTlAGSai5AtsOz17NGhU=/705x0:5573x3245/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425990/Ford_Maverick_2L_EcoBoost_AWD_Lariat_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVqMIb"&gt;Ford’s hot-in-demand 2022 Maverick pickup truck appears to be sold out, with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-shuts-off-orders-for-new-20-000-maverick-pickup-11643033093?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the automaker has taken the unusual step of suspending reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnGSlX"&gt;Ford reached out to its dealers to tell them it was suspending customer orders, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports. The company will resume taking orders for the plug-in hybrid truck this summer. A Ford executive confirmed the unusual move in an interview with the paper as well, stating: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sgw4Rs"&gt;“We didn’t want to take more orders than we could build,” said Dean Stoneley, general manager of Ford trucks, in an interview. “We’re getting customers who would have perhaps bought a used car and are now buying the Maverick because it is so affordable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8MCP68"&gt;The Maverick’s affordability — the base model starts at $20,000 — as well as its gas-electric hybrid powertrain have made the truck highly desirable for American car buyers who are hungry for cheaper, more environmentally friendly vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6H3JU"&gt;Car prices for both new and used models are at an all-time high amid soaring demand and tight inventory. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;ongoing microchip shortage&lt;/a&gt; is also helping to fuel shortages on dealership lots, further constraining buyer options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcG0Fl"&gt;The average transaction price for a new car is now higher than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price: $45,872 versus $45,209, according to the most recent data from Edmunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGEYlJ"&gt;Big trucks and SUVs, which are the biggest sellers in the US, are helping to drive that average price up. Automakers have responded by also slashing many entry-level vehicles from their lineup, including low-cost sedans and smaller SUVs and crossovers. The Maverick was an outlier: a highly affordable compact truck marketed to younger buyers and urban dwellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ysn456"&gt;A Ford spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Epnrb3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio is finally a real wooden boy in first teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Director Guillermo del Toro and a model of his new take on Pinocchio." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y5xdDLHW_WVsDoSRJeow1hCDdxU=/671x361:2930x1867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425824/GDTPinocchioPortrait.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CwDwlH"&gt;After years of being trapped in different circles of development hell, co-director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677646/nightmare-alley-guillermo-del-toro-teaser-noir"&gt;Guillermo del Toro’&lt;/a&gt;s long-awaited take on &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;is finally happening, and the stop-motion feature’s first teaser trailer is here to introduce the world to the story’s minuscule moral center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChzW0v"&gt;Set during Benito Mussolini’s fascist reign over Italy in the 1930s, del Toro’s &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;once again tells the tale of a wooden puppet who suddenly comes to life, much to his woodcarver “father’s” surprise. Unlike some of the other &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;tellings you may be familiar with, though, this film’s Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) quickly gets into the sorts of cruel mischief that put him at odds with Geppetto (David Bradley), who loves his son but can’t help but see that he isn’t exactly what one would call a “nice” child. Though this &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;presumes you’re probably familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167323/disney-live-action-adaptations-plus-streaming-pinocchio-peter-pan-wendy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; parts of this fairytale&lt;/a&gt; as a whole, Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor) makes clear in the teaser trailer that there’s more to be said, and he plans to be the one to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="juLqT1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yo02mwsWbAI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTukbW"&gt;Short as the teaser is, it’s got just enough detail to give you a sense of how &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/em&gt;’s more enchanting, playful moments might feel and sound. But what’s still not quite clear is how the film will dance between its fairytale elements and the dark real-world history woven into the narrative. &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;is co-directed by Mark Gustafson and written by del Toro and Patrick McHale. The film also stars David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Christoph Waltz, Finn Wolfhard, Cate Blanchett, John Turturro, Ron Perlman, Tim Blake Nelson, and Burn Gorman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3K6iI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit Netflix sometime this December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google sued by DC and three states for ‘deceptive’ Android location tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kQ1_-NJyQ7dkqZGCJ3IG6XmCA0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425814/acastro_181130_1777_google_bias_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVZNdX"&gt;The attorneys general of three states and the District of Columbia are &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23191075/DCv.Google_1_24_22_.pdf"&gt;suing Google&lt;/a&gt; for the allegedly deceptive collection of location data on Android. The complaints, which build on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272625/arizona-ag-sues-google-location-tracking-android-allegations"&gt;a 2020 lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by the Arizona Attorney General, allege that Google’s “complex web” of settings obfuscated whether users were sharing their location at a given moment. Furthermore, they allege Google pushed Android users with “repeated nudging, misleading pressure tactics, and evasive and deceptive descriptions” to share more information either “inadvertently or out of frustration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li42HM"&gt;“Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,” said DC Attorney General Karl Racine in a statement. “The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oY1o1"&gt;Racine’s suit, filed today, accuses Google of violating DC’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act. State attorneys general from Washington, Texas, and Indiana are also filing similar suits in their own jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vokGOu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/DCv.Google%281-24-22%29.pdf"&gt;The DC complaint&lt;/a&gt; claims that Google’s settings “purport to give consumers control over the location data Google collects and uses. But Google’s misleading, ambiguous, and incomplete descriptions of these settings all but guarantee that consumers will not understand when their location is collected and retained by Google or for what purposes.” Like the earlier lawsuit from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, the DC suit draws heavily on &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb"&gt;a 2018 &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that found “many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you’ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vaulnv"&gt;Reached for comment, Google denied the claims in the suit, pointing to recent changes like the ability to auto-delete location history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdDUKW"&gt;“The attorneys general are bringing a case based on inaccurate claims and outdated assertions about our settings,” said Google policy spokesperson José Castañeda. “We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mrv2R9"&gt;An Arizona judge, meanwhile, dealt a blow to the Arizona lawsuit last week by &lt;a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/01/26/judge-denies-ags-demand-for-summary-judgment-in-google-fraud-case/"&gt;denying a request&lt;/a&gt; for summary judgment, saying there wasn’t strong enough evidence that Google had actually misled consumers. The judge recommended the case move forward with a jury trial to resolve “a myriad of factual issues,” a path that Brnovich indicated he will pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Panasonic will reportedly start mass producing next-gen Tesla batteries in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI3t00wA4vjKoliMEv-aQ8wL4wQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70425140/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x4fWTA"&gt;Panasonic is due to start mass producing next-generation lithium-ion batteries for Tesla with five times the energy capacity of existing models as early as 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although the batteries are being manufactured primarily for Tesla, a Panasonic executive didn’t rule out supplying them to other companies in a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Panasonic-moves-toward-mass-production-of-Tesla-s-next-gen-batteries"&gt;November interview&lt;/a&gt;. The new batteries promise to boost the range of electric cars, and make them more affordable to produce and sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmcicz"&gt;In a statement &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/panasonic-invest-700-million-produce-new-batteries-evs-nikkei-2022-01-24/"&gt;given to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Panasonic declined to confirm &lt;em&gt;Nikkei’s &lt;/em&gt;report. “We are studying various options for mass production, including a test production line we are establishing this business year,” the company said. “We don’t, however, have anything to announce at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkdFU7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that the larger, higher-capacity batteries —  which are known as 4680 battery cells because they measure 46mm x 80mm in size — could increase the range of electric vehicles by around 20 percent, while Tesla itself has mentioned a 16 percent range increase. They could take a car like its flagship Model S and increase its range from 650km (around 404 miles) to 750km (around 465 miles), according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. Panasonic is reportedly expanding its Wakayama, Japan plant to mass produce the new batteries, and previously &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-supplier-shows-off-more-powerful-battery-11635144493?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that test production is due to start in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o6PeaY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla also hopes to produce the batteries in-house&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhShJd"&gt;The next-generation battery cells were detailed by Tesla at a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;high profile event in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. As well as their higher storage capacity, the company’s CEO Elon Musk said the cells are six times more powerful, and reduce cost per kWh by 14 percent (batteries are estimated to make up 30 percent of the cost of an electric vehicle). Lower prices and improved range are the sorts of improvements that are key to making electric cars more desirable, as &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGcH4B"&gt;The focus of Tesla’s 2020 event was on the company’s attempts to produce the batteries in-house, to reduce potential disruptions from relying on external suppliers like Panasonic. But in a series of tweets posted ahead of the event, Musk said the company would continue to buy battery cells from other companies. “We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp;amp; CATL,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1308149191684710400"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, adding that Tesla would be unlikely to achieve high-volume production of the cells until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBBCuP"&gt;During more recent earnings calls, Musk has reiterated that he expects Tesla’s in-house production of the 4680 cells to start in 2022, and that the first vehicles equipped with these cells will ship the same year. In an &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-q1-2021-earnings-call-live-blog/"&gt;April 2021 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Musk indicated the company was 12 to 18 months away from mass production of the new cells. However, in July he cautioned that “prototype production is easy, but high-volume production is hard,” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-supplier-shows-off-more-powerful-battery-11635144493?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blXCDB"&gt;The status of Tesla’s new battery cells is likely to be mentioned at the company’s upcoming earnings call on Wednesday, January 26th, when Musk has also said he would share an official “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1466800941269667841"&gt;product roadmap update&lt;/a&gt;” for the Cybertruck following reports of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881646/tesla-cybertruck-production-date-2022-removed-website"&gt;delay to early 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing sinks more money into electric air taxi project it’s co-developing with Kitty Hawk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Nj6IAQHFK8UewkiLfP8hjZ6tx4=/1172x0:8204x4688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70424855/Wisk_Aero_Media_Kit_Primary_Image_HD.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O1wbGS"&gt;Wisk Aero, the electric air taxi startup, raised $450 million from Boeing in a new funding round that it claims will make it “one of the most well-funded [advanced air mobility] companies in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHHiaO"&gt;In its announcement, Wisk highlights the fact that its “a privately-backed AAM leader,” setting up a contrast with a slate of similar startups that have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358027/lilium-flying-taxi-evtol-spac-electric-aviation-gm-engle"&gt;gone public&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;recent months&lt;/a&gt; by merging with special purpose acquisition companies, also known as SPACs or “blank check” companies. Wisk Aero was formed in 2019 as a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, the flying taxi company bankrolled by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/19/17586878/larry-page-flying-car-opener-kitty-hawk-cora"&gt;Google co-founder Larry Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z79u1L"&gt;Wisk says it will use the new funds to undertake a period of rapid growth, adding new employees to its current workforce of approximately 350 people and kicking off a manufacturing process that it says will result in a full-scale, commercially operational air taxi business within the next five years. Once that happens, the company predicts that it will conduct 14 million flights annually in around 20 major markets around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZGGh7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the company predicts that it will conduct 14 million flights annually&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1aFb8"&gt;Of course, all of this is contingent on the US Federal Aviation Administration and other government regulators giving Wisk the approval it needs to legally carry passengers. So far, the FAA has not certified any electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial operation. Experts have said that it can take a minimum of five years — and likely longer — for regulators to certify that these new types of aircraft are safe enough for passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkJjZO"&gt;Electric air taxis, sometimes misidentified as “flying cars,” are essentially small helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors. A number of startups have emerged in recent years with prototype aircraft that are electric-powered, able to carry a handful of passengers, and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. Analysts predict that the flying taxi market could grow to $150 billion in revenue by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oC2fug"&gt;Wisk hasn’t let the lack of regulatory approval get in the way of its business dealings. In addition to the newest founding announcement, the company made a deal last year with helicopter tourism-turned-urban mobility company Blade to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/boeing-backed-start-up-wisk-inks-first-deal-to-operate-air-taxis-in-the-us.html"&gt;own and operate a fleet of 30 aircraft on its network&lt;/a&gt;. Wisk also has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122341/wisk-flying-taxi-kitty-hawk-boeing-cora-new-zealand"&gt;signed deal with the government of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; to conduct a flying taxi trial using its all-electric, self-flying aircraft Cora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxcQGu"&gt;Its aim is for Cora to one day provide a flying taxi service that can reportedly be summoned with an app. The plan is for the vehicle to not have a pilot on board; instead, it will be flown mainly by autopilot systems, with supervision from a human pilot situated remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcoqwl"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369921/wisk-sues-archer-trade-secrets-theft-flying-taxi"&gt;Wisk accused rival eVTOL company Archer&lt;/a&gt; of stealing dozens of its design secrets, sparking a lawsuit and a subsequent federal investigation into the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Recreational drones banned in United Arab Emirates after oil facility attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="3d robotics solo drone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoZ2JRKqUKapVNU14cY-jldNp28=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70424843/best-drone-phantom-3dr-.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wLMpEl"&gt;The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has banned the flying of consumer drones by hobbyists. The news comes after a suspected drone attack hit an oil facility and airport in the country’s capital, Abu Dhabi, last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QGq3i"&gt;The ban was &lt;a href="https://www.moi.gov.ae/en/media.center/News/012222n01.aspx"&gt;announced by the Ministry of the Interior on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; and also applies to light aircraft like gliders. The ministry did not mention the recent attacks in its statement, but referenced “misuse spotted recently,” incidents of drone pilots “trespassing into areas where these types of activities are prohibited,” and a need to “ensure the safety of lives and property.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UEK1yc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The attack involved ‘ballistic missiles and explosive-laden drones’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bQKMSw"&gt;The recent attack on the oil facility and airport in Abu Dhabi reportedly involved both “ballistic missiles and explosive-laden drones,” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-dubai-united-arab-emirates-abu-dhabi-yemen-8bdefdf900ce46a6fd6c7bc685bf838a"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;APNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not clear from reports what the size and model of these drones were. The attacks were claimed by the Islamist, Iran-backed Houthi rebel group, which currently controls large portions of nearby Yemen and is fighting a coalition of forces supported by Arab countries including the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RI8cw6"&gt;Houthi rebels have previously used &lt;a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2021/02/10/Terrorism-White-House-condemns-Houthi-attack-on-Saudi-Arabia-s-Abha-airport"&gt;small drones&lt;/a&gt; in a number of attacks on Arab nations in recent years, including in the UAE and &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/saudi-arabian-oil-facility-struck-in-drone-attack/"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. But last week’s strike represents a escalation in tension. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-60082786"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; it’s the first time the UAE has officially acknowledged such attacks, and it’s the first time they’ve been fatal — killing three and wounding six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwiiIB"&gt;The UAE withdrew its forces from Yemen in 2019, but continues to supply and train local militia opposed to the Houthi. The country is keen to present itself as a bastion of stability in the region, and has been shifting diplomatic relations in recent years, including with Iran. In such a context, deadly strikes by drones and missiles are particularly unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPbHsu"&gt;A ban on recreational drone use may then help the UAE keep tighter control of its skies. &lt;em&gt;APNews&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-dubai-middle-east-abu-dhabi-yemen-75425bbfc0d5e2d07d882d7bb123c8f2"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the country already restricted flights in residential areas and near airports. The country’s ministry of the interior says that exceptions may be made for “work contracts or commercial or advertising projects that rely on filming using drones,” if those involved have attained “the necessary exceptions and permits.” &lt;/p&gt;
