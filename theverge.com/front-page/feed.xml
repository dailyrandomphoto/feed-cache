    <title>Gmail’s upcoming iOS widget could actually be useful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY5kSu3I_3iWhioAyqtaA8cXnPs=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125299/gmail_widget.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCy6If"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/stay-productive-these-google-features-ios/"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s updating the Gmail iOS widget with a new one that’s actually useful, showing you the subjects and senders of the emails sitting in your inbox. The company says the new widget will be “launching in the next few weeks,” to replace the previous version that wasn’t particularly well-received. This also means that, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/10/gmail-ios-widget-meet-sheets/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, this means that Gmail’s iOS widget will have the same functionality as the current Android one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5lXgJ"&gt;When the first version of the Gmail widget launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;we pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t particularly helpful. It really only provides shortcuts to different screens on the app like your inbox and the email composer. Critically, it doesn’t actually show you much information about the emails you’ve received, though it does tell you how many are sitting unread in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14nvlngEXOqt5quLjsKEo8_jzg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004270/Old_Widget.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old widget can only take to to the app’s search, compose, and inbox screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VCvrrd"&gt;Part of the old widget’s lack of functionality was due to Apple’s limitations. You’re currently not allowed to build interactivity into your widget, and any tapping the user does has to be handled by launching the app. Those rules haven’t substantially changed since the first widget was introduced, but the new design shows that there’s still room for useful information. You may not be able to archive an email from your home screen, for example, but you’ll at least be able to get a feel for what’s waiting in your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df821sd9pAlX_97Fz1mqYrEM-wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23004197/Sheets_Keyboardshortcuts.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google also says it’s updating Google Sheets’ keyboard shortcut support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s05ZO5"&gt;Google also announced other upcoming improvements to its apps that could be useful for heavy users of its services. Meet (it’s business-focused video chat app) is getting support for iOS’s picture-in-picture feature, so you can still see your co-workers or the presentation while you switch apps to check on a file or email. Google also says it’ll expand the keyboard shortcuts available for people who use Google Sheets with an external keyboard (including Apple’s Magic Keyboard case).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can see Netflix’s new AV1 streaming tech on select TVs and the PS4 Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgF1BEf-mV4__lNDbkvKobwJEq8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125293/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QCnKkR"&gt;Netflix now supports the AV1 codec when streaming to some TVs, &lt;a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-av1-streaming-to-netflix-members-tvs-b7fc88e42320"&gt;the company announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s only available on a select number of devices to start, though that list includes any TV connected to the PS4 Pro, so if you have one of those, you can give AV1 Netflix streaming a shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq7uND"&gt;Netflix shared this lineup of supported devices with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mlZSXr"&gt;Select 2020 UHD Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i9PEwb"&gt;Select 2020 UHD QLED Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uIgj21"&gt;Select 2020 8K QLED Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VIXThb"&gt;The Frame 2020 Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="beh83J"&gt;The Serif 2020 Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oXDwwM"&gt;The Terrace 2020 Smart TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gTDrEy"&gt;Any TV connected to a PS4 Pro streaming with the Netflix app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OJR2pR"&gt;Select Amazon Fire TV devices with Fire OS 7 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gwSO5E"&gt;Select Android TV devices with Android OS 10 and above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HidoSi"&gt;Netflix noted in its blog that “we are working with external partners to enable more and more devices for AV1 streaming,” so hopefully more hardware will be compatible soon. And the company also says it’s “exploring” the possibility of AV1 streams with HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEzIks"&gt;AV1 can lean on high-powered modern processors to stream better quality video with more compression than other video codecs, and in Netflix’s testing, it observed that AV1 delivered higher quality videos at the same bitrate as other formats and that testers saw fewer noticeable drops in video quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6kO9pw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AV1 has broad industry support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUYF7l"&gt;But this move likely isn’t entirely motivated by better streaming performance; since AV1 is an open-source codec, Netflix also won’t have to pay royalties to use it. The codec has broad industry support and is managed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which counts Apple, Amazon, Facebook (now Meta), Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Samsung and more &lt;a href="https://aomedia.org/membership/members/"&gt;as members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTQjTr"&gt;Netflix first supported AV1 videos in its Android app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126039/netflix-android-av1-video-codec-efficient-support-bandwidth-quality-vp9"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, it touted better streaming with AV1, saying that it saw a 20 percent improvement in compression when compared with the VP9 codec. In a blog for that announcement, Netflix said that its goal was to “roll out AV1 on all of our platforms,” and when we asked Wednesday, Netflix declined to share a timeline of when we might see AV1 Netflix streaming on other devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk offloads $1.1 billion worth of Tesla shares after Twitter poll troll</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fczm_8NJoaihJE0rEfVqtRQmOk=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70125144/REC_ASA3_CODE21_20210928_143439_0053_M.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Asa Mathat for Vox Media&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gcUx6R"&gt;Over the weekend, Elon Musk made headlines by tweeting, as he often does, and in one of the tweets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768364/elon-musk-poll-twitter-tesla-10-percent-billionaires-capital-gains-tax"&gt;proposed selling 10 percent of his stock in Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.” Now, SEC filings (&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000089924321044060/xslF345X03/doc4.xml"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000089924321044077/xslF345X03/doc4.xml"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) reveal the exec has exercised his options on over two million shares of the automaker and sold 934,091 of them (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/elon-musk-sells-1point1-billion-of-tesla-stock.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). At the company’s current valuation, the shares he sold are worth about $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edljqp"&gt;So did he do it because someone on Twitter voted one way or the other? In this case, no, because as analyst Matt Levine &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1458589565657169926"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the documents reveal the plan for this sale has been established since September 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XyDIrm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Tesla Technoking and SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk | Full Interview | Code 2021|104204" data-volume-uuid="c4bc5d03c" data-volume-id="104204" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-704" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6j07w3"&gt;As we told you over the weekend, Musk’s compensation plan granted him a number of shares that were due to expire in 2022. To exercise that grant, he will need to sell about $15 billion in shares, as he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698563/elon-musk-code-conference-liveblog"&gt;described in detail at the Code Conference on September 28th&lt;/a&gt;, two weeks after arranging this sale. At that time, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZP67-DECVw&amp;amp;t=2329s"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt;, “I have a bunch of options that are expiring early next year, so a huge block of options will sell in Q4. Because I have to, or they’ll expire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNqXkQ"&gt;The financial benefits and penalties that apply to Musk mean Wednesday’s sale is not the last one — and despite Musk’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22769731/elon-musk-billionaire-tax-stock-sell-off-ron-wyden-tweet"&gt;edgelord persona&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t matter what you say on Twitter about billionaires and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is emailing out gift cards to its online store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Pro 8 seen from above and to the right on a table with the Surface Slim Pen 2 next to it and Signature Keyboard attached. The screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-qaktgjNSbZ4YkcWEazBrWPl5A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124868/bfarsace_211004_4777_0035.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kCfh1e"&gt;It’s November, which means it’s officially the holiday season (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/1455021954763792397"&gt;according to Mariah Carey, at least&lt;/a&gt;), and Microsoft seems to already be celebrating by emailing people gift cards to the Microsoft Store. We’ve seen a few reports on Twitter of people receiving legitimate emails from Microsoft offering gift cards &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyB3RMUDEZ/status/1458564160443359238"&gt;for $10&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_cerdafied_/status/1458566511392481283?s=21"&gt;even $100&lt;/a&gt;, and the Microsoft Store Twitter account confirmed the promotion in a direct message with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2NCmg3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I wouldn’t have bothered to check the email I use for my Xbox live account if I didn’t see this tweet. Thanks! &lt;a href="https://t.co/SYFoCcduQT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SYFoCcduQT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christian Cerda (@_cerdafied_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_cerdafied_/status/1458566511392481283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5YQhC"&gt;It’s unclear who is eligible for the gift cards or how Microsoft is selecting people to get them. But if you have a Microsoft account or have signed up to receive emails from Microsoft, you might want to check your email to see if you’ve received a gift from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rXNVs"&gt;If you were lucky enough to get a gift card, there are lots of new products from Microsoft you can put your money toward. The company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;a wave of new Surface products in September&lt;/a&gt; that might catch your eye. If you’re a gamer, I would personally recommend the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;excellent &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which was released on Tuesday. Or, you could put the money toward a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which will let you play &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; now and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign when that’s released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS2ipp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 7:11PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Microsoft Store Twitter account confirmed the promotion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rep. Gosar anime video highlights ties to the online right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Committee Examines Unanswered Questions Surrounding The Capitol Insurrection" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8q4Zik3XAp_xLCD9l4QDMFQ1Jc=/2x0:2570x1712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124830/1232844555.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jonathan Ernst-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7zuCh"&gt;Republican Congressman Paul Gosar (AZ) ignited national fury this week after tweeting a video portraying himself as an anime character killing other prominent lawmakers. But while Democrats are now calling for his expulsion from Congress and his accounts to be banned, the incident has drawn new attention to Gosar’s long association with far-right meme culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9fl3L"&gt;Gosar first posted the problematic video parodying the opening credits of the popular anime series “Attack on Titan” on Sunday. The video — captioned “Any anime fans out there?” — depicts Gosar as one of the show’s main characters killing Democratic politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and President Joe  Biden by superimposing their faces onto those belonging to other characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPMHJW"&gt;Responding to the video on Monday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1457888052991381508?s=20"&gt;Ocasio-Cortez tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that “a creepy member I work with who fundraises for Neo-Nazi groups shared a fantasy video of him killing me,” likely referring to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=paul+gosar+fundraising+far-right&amp;amp;oq=paul+gosar+fundraising+far-right&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5466j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;a summer fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; linked to far-right influencer Nicholas Fuentes. She continued, “He’ll face no consequences,” because House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-CA) “cheers him on with no excuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXm710"&gt;The video was posted onto Gosar’s official congressional Twitter account and was viewed over 3 million times before it was removed. It’s unclear if Twitter or Gosar’s office removed the video as of publication. On Monday, Twitter placed a “public interest notice” over the tweet, saying that it violated the company’s policies against hateful conduct. Instagram also placed a “sensitive content” warning on the video, which was also posted to Gosar’s official account on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uy3Qfs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gosar’s video is just the latest example of a long-standing interest in the meme culture that’s popular in far-right internet communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kCHvMw"&gt;Democratic lawmakers are already demanding that Gosar face additional consequences for the video. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called on McCarthy to “join in condemning this horrific video and call on the Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1458105886182887424?s=20"&gt;in a Tuesday tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXj2uN"&gt;White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said at a press conference Tuesday, “This should not be happening, and we should be condemning it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxbdT4"&gt;As of Wednesday afternoon, McCarthy has yet to respond to Pelosi’s statements or those from the White House. His office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the video and Gosar’s future standing in the Republican caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJOjzu"&gt;But Gosar’s video is just the latest example of a long-standing interest in the meme culture that’s popular in far-right internet communities and image boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynx7Jt"&gt;In October, Gosar tweeted a now-deleted meme video depicting the “Doomer guy,” a sad-looking cartoon image of a man, in front of a series of articles with some headlines related to transgender people. At the end of the video, the “America First” logo is displayed over Gosar’s head, a reference to a popular white nationalist movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwZ6cO"&gt;In August, he tweeted an image of himself in front of cacti, all with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-congressman-paul-gosar-is-tweeting-a-green-arrow-po-1847590910"&gt;green lines edited&lt;/a&gt; in a reference to a red-pill pro-masculinity meme. In 2019, Gosar’s account tweeted out a thread &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gop-rep-paul-gosar-inserts-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-1839844491"&gt;that spelled out “Epstein didn’t kill himself&lt;/a&gt;” with the first two letters in a series of 22 tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUUZPu"&gt;This kind of content espouses a kind of rhetoric more often found in image boards than the halls of Congress, experts say. “This is incredibly intentional work,” said Jamie Cohen, assistant professor in media studies at Queens College. “This is by design, and it is internet fluency that is not your typical internet fluency from a member of Congress. This is a far-right influence being broadcast over a public speaker because he’s a public figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eF8VYI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He’s getting very good at expanding the borderlands”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hO1cr2"&gt;Gosar’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding who created the videos published on his Twitter feed. But in a now-deleted quote-tweet from his personal account, Gosar thanked his “team” for their creativity in editing the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mu3Nk"&gt;Gosar’s digital director, Jessica Lycos, responded to the backlash in a statement on Monday, saying, “We made an anime video.” Lycos continued, “Everyone needs to relax. The left don’t get meme culture. They have no joy. They are not the future. It’s a cartoon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qTuAS"&gt;As pressure continued to mount on Gosar in response to the video, his office put out a lengthy statement Tuesday night calling the backlash a “gross mischaracterization” of a symbolized “battled for the soul of America when Congress takes up Mr. Biden’s $4 trillion spending bill that includes amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.” Gosar continued, “I do not espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfWkIh"&gt;But experts argue that Gosar’s flirtation with right-wing meme culture is still harmful, normalizing extreme content even as it stays within the bounds of what’s acceptable. “When we normalize this type of media, we extend to the outward edges of what can be presented online,” Cohen said. “If he’s not held accountable, the next thing will be edgier and become acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMYcHl"&gt;“He’s getting very good at expanding the borderlands,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmsPBe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will now show full-sized images on web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMlgNu_hqlEB2J5b4rb8S56Iyw4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124780/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojFiAY"&gt;Twitter is dropping the crop on web. This is the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;update that banished&lt;/a&gt; Twitter’s awkward auto-cropping algorithm on its Android and iOS apps, which means that you’ll see images in their entirety on your timeline as you scroll through Twitter on your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PEUj8e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is now available on web!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pic looking good in the Tweet composer? That’s how it will look on the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6flZ1K"&gt;The same goes for when you post images of your own; you’ll see an accurate preview of your image that doesn’t appear oddly formatted when you post it. The platform touts its full-size preview window as a “what you see is what you get” look at your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI2agv"&gt;The ongoing changes to Twitter’s handling of photos stem from last year’s auto-crop controversy. Some users noticed that Twitter’s auto-cropping algorithm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;may favor white faces over Black faces&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a crop that shows white faces more prominently. Twitter looked into the issue and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444372/twitter-image-crop-racial-gender-bias-research"&gt;found that its auto-crop algorithm wasn’t very biased&lt;/a&gt; but still disabled it just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlozGj"&gt;Whether Twitter’s auto-crop feature was biased or not, I think we can all agree that we’re better off now that it’s gone for good. This means we’ll no longer miss out on interesting images because we were too lazy to click past the preview. I still might miss the awkwardly cropped images, though (as long as they’re not my own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CUbGc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Withings’ ScanWatch with built-in EKG is finally available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m95Ko4cU73TYIfFzCcFUpe-OqXc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124625/akrales_200916_4186_0153.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsrznF"&gt;After almost two years, the Withings ScanWatch is now available to purchase in the US after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; back at the beginning of 2020. The ScanWatch was waiting for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722333/withings-fda-clearance-blood-oxygen-heart-rhythm"&gt;clearance from the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which it had received in October for its EKG and blood oxygen measurement features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8t9j6"&gt;Unlike its competitors Apple Watch and Fitbit, both of whom can track blood oxygen and have EKG technology, Withings is claiming that the hybrid watch can detect sleep apnea, a sleep disorder charactered by disrupted breathing patterns. The ScanWatch is still a part of an &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004508038-ScanWatch-Clinical-studies#anchor_apnea"&gt;ongoing clinical study&lt;/a&gt; for this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YekNB7"&gt;Unlike Apple and Fitbit’s devices, the Withings ScanWatch also requires medical review. Users are required to &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;gain medical clearance&lt;/a&gt; to fully access the EKG feature, Withings says. After 24 to 48 hours, users can access their first EKG reading in the HealthMate app that they can install on their connected phones. During that time, their readings are sent to Heartbeat Health, a healthcare technology company, where they will be consulted by a cardiology team for clinical interpretation, &lt;a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/heartbeat-health-partners-with-withings-on-new-fda-cleared-hybrid-21547475?_ga=2.113187140.1736918582.1636383180-2013823946.1636055945"&gt;according to the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. This feature is only available if you’re over 22 years old, and in some states, you may be required to give your phone number so &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;Heartbeat Health can contact you directly about the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CnS4FP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"REVIEW: THE WITHINGS SCANWATCH KNOWS YOU’RE SLEEPING AND WHEN YOU’RE AWAKE, BUT NOT WHY","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bDzqUU"&gt;That’s a lot of hoops to jump through for something Apple and Fitbit can effectively do with a tap — but it could be worth it if you want a smartwatch that looks more like a regular one. The Withings ScanWatch is available in both white or black and is priced starting at $279 for the 38mm and $299 for the 42mm. It is currently being sold on the Withings website, Amazon and Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb improves accessibility search filters for its accommodations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Travel Websites Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAuMADxe8doiDw9s-whsXNkNHGA=/79x0:3465x2257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122314/1234731223.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKYJic"&gt;Airbnb has updated its search filters and accessibility review process with the goal of making it easier for people with disabilities to find accommodations on its platform, the company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/accessibility-review/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnpyuM"&gt;Hosts can now submit pictures of the accessibility features in their homes, and “a specialized team of Airbnb agents” will review them to determine if they’re suitable for people with disabilities. On its &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Faccessibility&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accessibility review page&lt;/a&gt;, Airbnb says that this team works “with engineers, designers, and others across the company” but doesn’t specifically state whether they’re trained or how they’re qualified to recognize accessibility features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUjDx1"&gt;We reached out to Suzanne Edwards, Airbnb’s head of hosting accessibility standards, for a clearer answer. “Airbnb agents are trained based on a rigorous set of accessibility photo standards,” she explained. “For instance, for a Host to list an accessible parking spot — a private driveway at least 11 feet wide or a parking spot designated for a person with disabilities with clear signage — they must show the proximity of the parking spot to the guest entrance, as well as the signage or markings for a designated accessible space, or capture the entire driveway with a parked vehicle if possible to show its width.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SufLt9"&gt;Airbnb says its staff has already reviewed and approved 100,000 accessibility features in 25,000 different homes globally, which CEO Brian Chesky noted on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ERfJuE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Accessibility Review: &lt;br&gt;We’re reviewing every accessibility feature on Airbnb for accuracy. To date, our agents have double checked photos of features in more than 25,000 homes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CfDh808qGM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CfDh808qGM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1458109384144211972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rCcTxa"&gt;Airbnb also updated its search filters for accessibility features. Some filters, like ones for step-free bedroom access and accessible parking spaces, will now be shown more prominently on the search screen. Airbnb made filters pertaining to wide entryways slightly more specific by adding a more precise measurement. For example, instead of “wide entrance to bedroom,” Airbnb changed it to “bedroom entrance wider than 32 inches.” As it stands, these 13 filters are still fairly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrXEGT"&gt;Airbnb also announced that it’s making it easier to find accessible Experiences, improving its 11 accessibility filters to allow guests to find activities near their rental that offer features like sign language, provide access to accessible bathrooms, take place on a flat surface, and more. Airbnb is also requiring hosts to submit detailed information about the accessibility measures they’re taking, which then goes under review for “description quality.” Each Experience listing will also clearly show its available accessibility features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knKK7y"&gt;In 2017, a study found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15729326/airbnb-disability-discrimination-study"&gt;Airbnb hosts were more likely to reject guests with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17125452/airbnb-disabilities-accommodations-search-filter-travel"&gt;rolled out an accessibility update&lt;/a&gt; adding 21 filters that let guests search for homes with wider entrances, accessible bathrooms, and more. The number of filters has since dropped to 13, which is a bit strange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFydxP"&gt;Previous filters, like “wide clearance to bed,” “accessible height toilet,” and “handheld showerhead,” are now missing from the current list. An Airbnb spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company decided to simplify the list, stating: “To better serve our guests, and with input from our community and partners, we have updated the filters to make it easier for guests to find homes which suit their needs. One of those updates is simplifying to focus on essential and most used filters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl0I3z"&gt;Airbnb first started requiring hosts to upload photos of the accessibility features in their stays &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/introducing-new-ways-to-improve-accuracy-of-accessibility-information-for-guests/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been long overdue for an update. “We’ve continuously been working to improve our offerings with input from our community and with experts from the disability community, and we will continue to do so,” Edwards told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="I8DHQ5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Airbnb’s CEO thinks the platform can replace your landlord","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22453150/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-interview-host-rentals-long-term"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rdfYus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add statements from Suzanne Edwards and an Airbnb spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn buys Ohio electric vehicle factory once touted by Donald Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJWLys73Nn9rp3jW40m8e_ECAe0=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124419/1232963360.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AzaloN"&gt;Foxconn has officially agreed to buy the former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors, giving the iPhone assembler its first automotive factory and a second chance at establishing a manufacturing foothold in the United States. The Taiwanese conglomerate has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732897/foxconn-electric-vehicles-foxtron-platform-evs"&gt;spent the last year&lt;/a&gt; buying up or partnering with companies in the electric vehicle space in a massive effort to diversify away from laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBJZUD"&gt;The two companies &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/foxconn-and-lordstown-motors-enter-transformative-strategic"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that they’ve agreed to the framework deal first announced in September, meaning Foxconn will pay Lordstown Motors $230 million for the 6.2-million-square-foot factory. Foxconn has also agreed to contract manufacture Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck, the Endurance. The deal is expected to close by the end of April next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uk7cy"&gt;The startup bought the plant from GM in 2019 months after the leading US automaker had shuttered it — a decision that drew the ire of then-President Donald Trump. Trump pumped up Lordstown Motors’ effort to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;buy the factory in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;, saying in a tweet that it was “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” After that, Lordstown Motors became something of a darling of the Trump administration. It was invited to the White House for an event, and Mike Pence appeared at the event where the startup revealed the Endurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v8BpaS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lordstown Motors desperately needs the money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FfKRha"&gt;Lordstown Motors has struggled mightily since, though, despite raising nearly $700 million when it went public in late 2020. It is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;currently under investigation&lt;/a&gt; by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice after a short-selling research firm raised allegations of fraud. A number of executives have resigned, including president Rich Schmidt, which Lordstown Motors announced Wednesday morning. The startup had said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;earlier this year that it would run out of cash in May 2022&lt;/a&gt; without more funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6KlVS"&gt;The Ohio factory is the second location where Foxconn overlaps with Trump. The first was in Wisconsin, where Trump touted Foxconn’s planned LCD factory as the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;eighth wonder of the world&lt;/a&gt;.” The plans for that factory have been dramatically revised down in scope ever since, though, and Foxconn has done little more at the location than raze acres of land and put up some empty buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1QcXL"&gt;Lordstown Motors will continue to rent space in the Ohio factory, and it announced Wednesday that will work with Foxconn to develop vehicles on the Taiwanese conglomerate’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732897/foxconn-electric-vehicles-foxtron-platform-evs"&gt;new EV platform&lt;/a&gt;. Another EV startup, Fisker Inc., will use some space in the factory, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh0FOa"&gt;Lordstown Motors said earlier this year that it had already spent $240 million updating the factory to get it ready to build the Endurance. The startup will also get to keep its electric motor production line, as well as its battery module and pack assembly lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEdSSI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify now frustratingly defaults to autoplay for connected devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4jYR2BJ0t_Iw89idjxfFnAaiCUw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124377/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D0id8v"&gt;Spotify quietly updated its autoplay feature with a seriously frustrating quirk. When you play music on your Spotify Connect devices, autoplay is now enabled by default and there’s no way to turn it off. This means that after your album, playlist, or your song selection is done playing on any device other than your phone or computer, Spotify will continue playing recommended tracks indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhWM1F"&gt;Users have voiced their complaints in the Spotify Community forum for weeks, filling &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Podcasts-Partners-etc/Connect-Autoplay-DISABLED-but-still-ACTIVE/td-p/5279608/page/7"&gt;an ongoing thread&lt;/a&gt; with their grievances. It caught the attention of a Spotify Community moderator, who provided some more information about the issue — which is apparently a feature and &lt;em&gt;definitely not a bug&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qdgibM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can confirm that Autoplay is the default setting for any connected device”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w5A9dp"&gt;“We can confirm that Autoplay is the default setting for any connected device,” a Spotify spokesperson said in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This means that whenever you play music from Spotify on a device other than your phone or computer, Autoplay will be enabled, and tracks will be added to continue your listening experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZUf3j"&gt;However, the spokesperson says that “Autoplay will not commence if you play a track, album, or playlists with Repeat enabled.” That obviously doesn’t help if you want an album or playlist to end after it’s done playing. The spokesperson also mentioned that Spotify updated the experience “during the last couple of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdTXsN"&gt;In the aforementioned thread, the Spotify moderator suggested that users cast their votes in a post in &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/AutoPlay-Option-to-toggle-Autoplay-on-off-across-all-devices/idi-p/5283776"&gt;the Spotify Idea Exchange&lt;/a&gt; to show support for an option to toggle autoplay on and off, but the page that the moderator links to doesn’t address that exact issue. In the post’s description, the user asks for Spotify to bring back the settings menu on the Spotify web player that was recently removed, which prevents users from changing their autoplay options when listening from the web player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPtmPc"&gt;Other than the title of the post: “[AutoPlay] Option to toggle Autoplay on/off across all devices/platforms,” it doesn’t have much to do with the problem users were initially discussing, causing confusion in that entire thread — comments on the post concern both the settings menu and the problem with Spotify Connect. It’s unclear whether bringing back the settings menu on the web player will help resolve the autoplay issue on connected devices (or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7h0s8"&gt;When a post on the Spotify Idea Exchange receives over 180 votes in under six months, the suggestion gets the “Live Idea” label and will be looked at by the Spotify team. Right now, this so-called idea is currently a “Good Suggestion,” meaning it received more than 50 votes in under three months. The status should be upgraded soon, though, since it has a total of 259 votes at this time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHUOBN"&gt;It’s ironic that Spotify calls something that’s essentially a bug report an “idea.” After all, music on connected devices wasn’t set on an infinite loop too long ago. With Spotify projected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746682/spotify-q3-2021-earnings-podcast-music-streaming-financials"&gt;increase its user base from 381 million to 400 million&lt;/a&gt; users by the end of this year, it’s going to have a lot more users it needs to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDJW9D"&gt;“At Spotify, we’re committed to delivering the best possible listening experience. We recently updated our Autoplay settings for connected devices, and are actively gathering feedback from the Spotify Community,” the Spotify spokesperson continued&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;As always, we’ll continue to evolve this feature over time based on user feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
