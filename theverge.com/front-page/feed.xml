    <title>Celeste developer teases next game with a ‘vibe reveal’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgPeRl"&gt;The developer of indie hits &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Towerfall &lt;/em&gt;has unveiled its next game: &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt;. There aren’t many details about the game just yet, but Extremely OK Games billed Monday’s news as a “vibe reveal,” taking the wraps off the game’s title, a poster, and a song from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8S8Jw"&gt;You can see the poster and the game’s logo (designed by Pedro Medeiros) and hear the song (composed by Lena Raine) in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/exok_games/status/1384182598507778052"&gt;teaser video posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zfn4b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Earthblade   Vibe reveal!  ( sound on!) &lt;br&gt;A 2D explor-action game in a seamless pixel art world. The next release from the Celeste team, coming 20XX. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ceAM80PEaG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ceAM80PEaG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Extremely OK Games (@exok_games) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/exok_games/status/1384182598507778052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjcBO2"&gt;We might be waiting a while for the actual release of the game. Extremely OK Games has only officially listed a vague “20XX” release date, and the studio’s Maddy Thorson &lt;a href="https://exok.com/posts/2021-04-19-earthblade/"&gt;said in Monday’s announcement blog&lt;/a&gt; that “it sounds optimistic to say out loud that &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt; could be released within 5 short years of &lt;em&gt;Celeste.” &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Celeste, &lt;/em&gt;if you were wondering,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;came out in January 2018.) “The truth is that we don’t know how long it will take, just that it will take as long as it takes (and that it will take a long time),” Thorson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwgcY0"&gt;We might also be waiting some time for more news about the game. “While making &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;, we basically tweeted out whatever interesting-looking thing we were working on day-to-day, when we were in the mood for sharing,” Thorson said. “But an air of mystery lends itself particularly well to this project, so we’ve opted to save it all up for a big reveal that will hopefully blow your socks off. It’ll probably be a while before you get more information about &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEIOOG"&gt;While you’re waiting for &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt;, you should play &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; if you haven’t already. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857240/celeste-farewell-dlc-expansion-masterpiece-platformer-game-release-date"&gt;It’s really good&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EELxHj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Celeste’s massive new expansion is a good time to play the platforming masterpiece","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857240/celeste-farewell-dlc-expansion-masterpiece-platformer-game-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Watch the first footage of a helicopter on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A tiny helicopter standing on four skinny legs on the dusty red Martian surface. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KlvdQou4mHE1Su9Z-doGJ3Fg-9Y=/0x62:1578x1114/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151107/PIA24581.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ingenuity helicopter on the surface of Mars.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1nUQrD"&gt;There’s new video of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars, captured by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance rover’s&lt;/a&gt; cameras and posted to Twitter by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The copter had its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;first flight earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, lifting 10 feet off the Martian surface for 39 seconds and marking the first flight of a powered craft on another planet. The video shows the tissue box-sized craft zipping up and hovering in place before gracefully landing back on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uiofo3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Witness the historic moment in full. The Mastcam-Z cameras on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAPersevere&lt;/a&gt; show us the takeoff, hovering and landing of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ypdIWmC4D1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ypdIWmC4D1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1384202604620632074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vK66Si"&gt;The video was shot at a 34mm focal length at 6.7 frames per second and is a sequence of about 1,400 frames, according to Perseverance imaging scientist Justin Maki. A “full-zoom version” at 110mm is coming in the next few days, along with photos from Ingenuity’s 13-megapixel horizon-facing camera. A black-and-white &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/ingenuity-s-first-black-and-white-image-from-the-air/"&gt;photo of its shadow&lt;/a&gt;, taken with its 1.5-megapixel navigation camera during the flight, has already been sent back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwUL8C"&gt;Ingenuity’s flight was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;delayed multiple times&lt;/a&gt; because of an issue that required reinstalling its flight control software. NASA engineers are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1384099533026566148"&gt;delighted&lt;/a&gt; at the success of the first flight test. Unlike Perseverance, Ingenuity won’t be involved in carrying out any specific experiments or explorations on Mars, but there are more flight tests planned for it in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Clubhouse competitor is coming this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ODCnkLbbLZb3FubuIfykF572fw=/8x0:904x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151015/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_11.54.43_AM.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N2mXAw"&gt;Facebook is going all in on audio. The company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/"&gt;announced multiple products&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that emphasize voice content over text, images, or video. The products will be released over the next few months and, in some cases, will start with a limited set of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esGGS8"&gt;Most notably, Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;indeed launching&lt;/a&gt; a competitor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;the buzzy social audio app Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; with a feature called Live Audio Rooms, which will be available this summer. It’ll first roll out to groups and public figures as a test, but it will eventually make its way to Messenger, too, so people can hang out with friends. Users will be able to record their conversations and distribute them, and eventually, people can charge for access to these rooms through either a subscription or one-time fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjUGLX"&gt;To get people to join, Facebook says it’s introducing an Audio Creator Fund to “support emerging audio creators.” All of these conversations can also be turned into “Soundbites,” a forthcoming feature that allows people to create and share shortform audio clips along with an algorithmic feed to promote them. Think TikTok, but with audio clips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6DeEilFJCup_LHIBztYP_0_OSws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455069/Soundbites_Audio_Creation_Tool_and_Listening_Side_by_Side.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Soundbite creation tool will let people put effects on their voices.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kXOO8a"&gt;Soundbites will live within the broader News Feed. Users will be able to record them in a separate tool within Facebook, which the company describes as a “sound studio in your pocket.” In a chat with Casey Newton, the author of &lt;em&gt;Platformer &lt;/em&gt;and a contributing editor at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg equated Soundbites to Reels, Instagram’s TikTok competitor, but for audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQdvPE"&gt;He also added that he likes audio over video or images because it allows people to multitask and host longer, nuanced conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrh3T"&gt;“The high-level picture here is that we think that audio is, of course, also going to be a first-class medium, and that there are all these different products to build across this whole spectrum,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDzYY9"&gt;Facebook also plans to take on a bigger role in podcasting. The company says it’ll start recommending shows and episodes based on people’s interests and that people can comment on them and recommend them to friends. The company says 170 million people on Facebook are connected to a page that’s linked to a specific podcast, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfP0MQvs8OGeevlTQKNWZK8ei74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455083/Podcasts_Listening.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook wants to support podcasts with direct monetization.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8QIvrI"&gt;Zuckerberg says a partnership with Spotify is forthcoming, too, which will bring the company’s player over to Facebook, letting people stream music and podcasts from their News Feed. Zuckerberg emphasized that this feature is for music. But still, Facebook users will be able to share Spotify podcasts and let people listen without having to leave the Facebook world — they just have to link their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhNbHw"&gt;“Our ambition has always been to make Spotify ubiquitous across platforms and devices — bringing music and podcasts to more people — and our new integration with Facebook is another step in these efforts,” a Spotify spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to a continued partnership with Facebook, fueling audio discovery around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKqUiT"&gt;Finally, Facebook’s tipping system, Stars, will be coming to Live Audio Rooms as well as for individual creators and public figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVnMzu"&gt;How serious Facebook is about audio and whether users actually want it over other formats is still unclear. On one hand, the audio industry is hot right now, with most major tech companies wading into the broader podcasting industry. Clubhouse and other audio startups have also made live audio a popular way to interact, and already, multiple big platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;have integrated&lt;/a&gt; the format into their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpYbQk"&gt;On the other hand, live audio has clearly found its moment during the pandemic, when everyone’s been starved of human interaction and mostly confined to their homes. Podcasting offers edited, on-demand conversations, which people have enjoyed for years, but whether the live formats will survive remains an open question. Facebook has also routinely gone all in on a format, only for it to languish. It went for longform video with IGTV but has since pivoted to a focus on Reels. It launched and subsidized Facebook Live content, which has since mostly fallen by the wayside. The same could happen for audio, but Facebook is clearly using its size to try to make its mark on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox update speeds up downloads by suspending games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ViRiWnQ2OeezB4w_jJs1QJ0ZIiI=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150847/twarren_200909_4177_0029.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1j2yS"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox April dashboard update today that will improve the way games are downloaded. A new feature will now let Xbox owners suspend games to speed up download speeds. Currently, Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S systems throttle game updates and new game downloads if another game is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2bpXS"&gt;This new suspend option can be coupled with Quick Resume on the Xbox Series X / S to quickly pause a game, download game updates, or download a new game altogether and then resume the suspended game later. It’s a much cleaner option than having to manually quit a game or app to ensure download speeds aren’t getting throttled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDcHmveJo-5D4rBK85LvKy1Bcbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455028/SdRN4pK.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new suspend option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4MP2Q"&gt;Alongside this new dashboard option, Microsoft is finally improving its Xbox mobile app to bring achievements back. The newly designed app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524109/microsoft-xbox-app-iphone-ipad-game-streaming-xbox-app-microsoft-features"&gt;launched on Android and iOS back in October&lt;/a&gt;, but it was missing achievements functionality and many other features that the mobile app previously included. Monthly leaderboards for achievements are also starting to appear for some Xbox mobile app users, and &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/19/xbox-update-april-2021/"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; “everyone will see these updates in the app by the end of the month.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony admits it made ‘wrong decision’ and will keep PS3, Vita stores open</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Rs6HJhEdVjguLGjgpROtkYF6n8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150568/vpavic_191205_untitled_0018_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2y8tri"&gt;Sony has announced that it’ll be keeping its PS3 and PlayStation Vita digital storefront open “for the foreseeable future.” The PSP’s store will still be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356791/sony-playstation-store-close-ps3-vita-psp-game-downloads"&gt;shut down on July 2nd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as originally planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar3s3A"&gt;“Upon further reflection, however, it’s clear that we made the wrong decision here. So today I’m happy to say that we will be keeping the PlayStation Store operational for PS3 and PS Vita devices. PSP commerce functionality will retire on July 2, 2021 as planned,” Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/19/playstation-store-on-ps3-and-ps-vita-will-continue-operations/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNCcRU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The PS3 and PS Vita stores will stay open “for the foreseeable future”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EkRNMm"&gt;Sony had originally announced that the digital storefronts for its legacy consoles would be shut down at the end of March, making it impossible for customers to purchase digital copies of games for those systems. Sony says that the move to discontinue to the storefronts was “born out of a number of factors, including commerce support challenges for older devices” along with a desire to focus more on newer products (like the PlayStation 5). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JP7jZE"&gt;Following the announcement, though — and the backlash from PS3 and PS Vita owners upset that they would no longer be able to buy new games — it seems that Sony has relented and will be keeping those stores open indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgw3Of"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s Luxe is a fashion-focused fitness band that costs $149.95</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fitbit luxe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-iYQD2H-C8Pr97fzDQIQ8ivJSs=/0x0:5407x3605/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150525/fitbitluxehero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit’s Luxe comes in a few different finishes&lt;/em&gt; | Fitbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVjvfb"&gt;Fitbit has announced its new Luxe fitness tracker that looks like a more fashion-focused take on the Inspire 2. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387591/fitbit-luxe-fitness-tracker-photo-leak-news"&gt;leaked last week&lt;/a&gt;, but Fitbit is making it official with the news that the Luxe is available for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/vergeFitbit'sLuxeFashion04192021/https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/trackers/luxe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder starting today&lt;/a&gt;, April 19th, for $149.95. This cost includes six months of the Fitbit Premium service, which usually costs $9.99 per month. The service recently launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295768/fitbit-premium-mindful-method-deepak-chopra-wellness-series"&gt;the new Mindful Method program&lt;/a&gt; created by Deepak Chopra that packs in over 30 audio and video sessions on mindfulness and wellness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKjKT1"&gt;A specific release date for the Luxe hasn’t been shared, but the company is aiming for a spring launch, so it shouldn’t be too long of a wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0pKt9"&gt;The Luxe was designed for “a diverse range of wrist sizes and skin tones for 24/7 wear.” Fitbit says the Luxe is its thinnest touchscreen tracker yet, and the company thinks most people should be able to sleep comfortably with it on. To that end, you won’t need to charge it every night, as Fitbit claims it’ll last up to five days per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvbA7Y"&gt;The Luxe includes an interchangeable silicone strap with several size adjustments. Other straps will be available at launch, including silicone bands in a few colors for $29.95 each, woven fabric bands for $34.95, leather bands for $49.95, stainless steel mesh bands for $79.95, going all the way up to $99.95 for stainless steel link bracelets from luxury jewelry brand Gorjana. If you just want the Luxe with the Gorjana band, a limited-edition version of the tracker costing $199.95 will include one starting in June.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Luxe in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wxtBvo"&gt;The Luxe is angled toward people who want their fitness tracker to be taken for jewelry. The company even went as far as using a metal injection molding process to craft the Luxe’s stainless steel case, which is apparently a traditional technique for jewelry-making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OH6QH0"&gt;The Luxe is a buttonless tracker, and inputs are delegated to its color OLED touchscreen. Like its previous smartwatches and trackers, Fitbit’s Luxe will be supported for iOS and Android devices. It’ll also support Google Fast Pair to pair more quickly to Android devices. The Luxe supports connected GPS while paired to your phone, so you’ll need to bring your phone along if you want to track runs or walks. If having built-in GPS is important to you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;Fitbit’s Charge 4&lt;/a&gt; includes that and other features like Fitbit Pay and Spotify controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zyRLE"&gt;Fitbit is using this launch to announce that the Luxe, along with the company’s other heart rate-enabled trackers and watches, support the companion app’s Stress Management Score that assesses your activity level, sleep schedule, and heart rate to help you manage stress. Through the app, the Luxe can track a host of other metrics, like your breathing pattern, your resting and variable heart rate, skin temperature, mood, sleep, and menstrual cycles. Sometime after launch, it’ll be able to record your blood oxygen levels (Sp02).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends Mobile is going into beta this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vdP7Ua-8TNUEr3-Ie9EQQut0tqw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150509/ss_33caf1a7c20297bbca8bb434976a709d39e104af.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPYwtS"&gt;It’s been a long time since we’ve heard about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18536028/apex-legends-iphone-android-mobile-ea-respawn"&gt;the mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll be seeing more of it very soon: EA announced that a regional beta for the game will kick off later this month. Initially, the publisher says the game will only be available to “a few thousand players in India and the Philippines,” but the plan is to roll it out to more countries over the course of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5scQ7X"&gt;The company also provided some of the first details of the game. Most importantly, it won’t be a port of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, but instead a new version built for smartphones. “&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is specially designed for touchscreens, with streamlined controls, and thoughtful optimizations that result in the most advanced battle royale combat available on a phone,” &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; game director Chad Grenier wrote in a blog post. This also means it won’t feature any kind of crossplay or cross-progression. And like the PC and console version of the game, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;will be free on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phTPJE"&gt;These kinds of mobile-exclusive spinoffs are becoming increasingly popular for big multiplayer games. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;Riot recently launched &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a smartphone take on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"&gt;Psyonix is doing something similar with &lt;em&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, remains one of the most popular games in the world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;recently surpassing 1 billion downloads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kvhqvw"&gt;The main version of &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;just hit a new milestone of 100 million players&lt;/a&gt;, and last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323591/apex-legends-switch-port-cross-progression-purchases-fortnite"&gt;the game expanded to the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota finally gets off its ass and announces a real electric vehicle strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JDc33gbW9ZK1SWrJgToPR3JaRZQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150480/20210419_01_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0N7qsD"&gt;Toyota, an early pioneer in electrification that has since fallen far behind its competitors, finally announced an electric vehicle strategy that will result in 15 new battery-electric vehicles released by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcbWev"&gt;The company, which helped pave the way for companies like Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular, also unveiled a new concept EV at the Shanghai Motor show called the BZ4X. The electric SUV concept will serve as a starting point for other models with the BZ (which stands for “Beyond Zero”) branding in the future. Toyota did not reveal any details or specifications for the BZ4X, but it did say the vehicle would be released in China and Japan later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RASDOu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota said it would release 70 new models by 2025&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU3koD"&gt;In total, Toyota said it would release 70 new models by 2025, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids, for a range of “diverse choices” for its customers. The company, which is the largest automaker in the world, will build these vehicles using the flexible platform that it developed in partnership with fellow Japanese automaker Subaru. (Toyota currently owns a small stake in Subaru.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MCZ45F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10454306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PiWAs"&gt;The BZ4X will be built on this e-TNGA platform, which will enable several characteristics, including a steer-by-wire system, all-wheel drive, improved visibility, and a regenerative braking system that is common among electric vehicles. Toyota said the BZ4X would be released globally by the middle of 2022. Subaru is rumored to be designing its own electric vehicles built on the e-TNGA platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHOmMl"&gt;Though it’s just a concept, the BZ4X looks to be close to completion. The interior of the car features a unique instrument cluster, with the screen set back from the steering wheel in a way that Toyota says will improve driver visibility. The central infotainment screen appears to be floating above the dash as opposed to embedded within it. And there are a number of physical buttons in the center console and on the steering wheel, proof that Toyota is not fully embracing the digital user experience like companies like Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rtby7U"&gt;Up until this point, Toyota has resisted fully embracing electric vehicles as the future of the auto industry, despite its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. In its announcement, Toyota touted its success in the hybrid market, noting that it has sold 17 million “electrified vehicles” since the Prius’ release in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5NtLCf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota has been content to rest on its laurels with the Prius&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WDyBfR"&gt;But while Toyota has been content to rest on its laurels with the Prius, the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted as much in this article from 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBKhh0"&gt;Meanwhile, Toyota’s top executives, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/"&gt;including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPrT5G"&gt;Of course, we’ll know more about how serious Toyota is in embracing electric vehicles when the company has more to say about powertrain details and range, as well as the types of vehicles it will be making. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Union says Amazon threatened layoffs in formal objection to election results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFfQx3kgMASGCVLEFGliBXjbLLo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150299/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EPkFFp"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) has filed a formal objection to the results of a union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, alleging the e-commerce company threatened to lay off workers. The employees voted against unionizing in an April 9th vote, but the RWDSU is arguing that the results should be set aside because Amazon “created an atmosphere of confusion, coercion and/or fear of reprisals and thus interfered with the employees’ freedom of choice,” the union said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGzL0t"&gt;“Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees,” RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement Monday. “We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE4MSx"&gt;Amazon said in a statement that it was looking forward to the next steps in the legal process. “The fact is that less than 16% of employees at BHM1 voted to join a union,” the statement reads. “Rather than accepting these employees’ choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APYwV1"&gt;Workers voted by mail in February and March whether they wanted to join the RWDSU. Of the roughly 5,800 workers at the Bessemer warehouse, 3,041 voted in the election, with 1,798 workers voting against and 738 voting in favor, according to the NLRB. Known as BHM1, Bessmer is only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;the second US Amazon facility&lt;/a&gt; to hold a union vote. If it had been approved, BHM1’s union would have been the biggest group to gain representation in a single NLRB election since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IMzyg"&gt;The RWSDU has a list of 23 objections it has filed with the NLRB. Among other things, the union claims Amazon threatened employees that the Bessemer warehouse would close if they joined a union, and that the company sent an email warning it would lay off workers if the union was voted in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWS91a"&gt;It also alleges that Amazon installed a ballot collection box in the warehouse parking lot, creating the appearance that the company — rather than the NLRB — controlled the election, and it monitored the collection box via security cameras. An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the RWDSU allegations about the collection box are not accurate. “We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy. The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB’s own data showed would reduce turnout,” the spokesperson said. “This mailbox—which only the USPS had access to—was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHv881"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;The mailbox was a major source of contention&lt;/a&gt; during the vote. According to the RWDSU, Amazon pressured workers to bring their ballots to work and put them in the collection box rather than sending ballots by mail and removed workers who supported the union from mandatory captive-audience training sessions. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anw9k/amazon-sends-vote-no-instructions-to-unionizing-employees-tells-them-to-use-new-mailbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; also reported&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon sent instructions to employees to vote “no” and told them to use the controversial mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXbNX1"&gt;The union is seeking an investigation into what it says is behavior by Amazon that corrupted the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPoGNB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQfTSa"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFuIYq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCUQEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future was investigated by the Department of Labor in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ow7D-RE42SBgEj92HybA2xXNOWs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150231/faraday_future_ff91_5232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFONuk"&gt;Faraday Future was investigated by the Department of Labor in 2020, though the electric vehicle startup says the matter was “resolved,” according to a previously unreported passage in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021020004/fs42021_propertysolutions.htm"&gt;a recent regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emRwYP"&gt;The startup didn’t say what the investigation was about or how much it paid to resolve the legal matter. Faraday Future’s former chief lawyer has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916/gov.uscourts.cacd.793916.1.0.pdf"&gt;claimed in a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that the company was previously inspected by the Department of Homeland Security’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services division in 2018, though the startup denied this in court filings. A spokesperson for Faraday Future declined to comment on the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRRJAk"&gt;The regulatory filing, known as the S-4 “registration statement,” was published as part of Faraday Future’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)&lt;/a&gt; called Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. When that merger is done, Faraday Future will be a publicly traded company and will have around $1 billion in fresh cash — capping a remarkable turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy and giving it the money it needs to finally try to put its high-performance, ultra-luxury electric SUV into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PFXBhX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The filing offers the best X-ray of Faraday Future’s business to date&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="99J3KK"&gt;One of the trade-offs of going public is that you have to disclose far more information than you do as a private company. So this dense document not only offers the best X-ray of Faraday Future’s business to date, but it also sheds light on a number of other previously dark corners of the history of the troubled startup and its founder, Chinese tech tycoon Jia Yueting. Here are a few other things that stood out: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YMcWqW"&gt;Jia Yueting is a risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="b2aAT5"&gt;Jia has spent the last few years living in California after self-exiling himself from China, where he was named to a debtor blacklist following the collapse of his tech conglomerate LeEco. His habit of borrowing too much money &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/8/18130543/faraday-future-jia-yueting-leeco-leshi-debt-china"&gt;has left a trail of “debt bombs” that continues to haunt him to this day&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the weight of that debt is what drove him to file for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2020/7/24/21310034/faraday-future-jia-yueting-bankruptcy-details-sovereign-wealth-fund"&gt;personal bankruptcy in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and now those companies he owed money to have small equity stakes in Faraday Future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exOCIt"&gt;The way Jia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;tightened his grip&lt;/a&gt; on Faraday Future over the years is also what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;led to many of the startup’s problems&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtUm1E"&gt;While Jia has been replaced as CEO, all of this baggage presents a risk to the company going forward — literally. Public companies have to list out all of the imaginable problems that investors should know about, and Jia has his own dedicated “risk factor.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4bSWyo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faraday Future’s founder has a lot of baggage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hahefn"&gt;As that section reads, Jia’s “image will be closely associated with [Faraday Future’s] brand,” according to the filing, and the “media’s focus on negative coverage could materially and adversely affect FF’s valuation and investors’ confidence. Such negative publicity could also solicit inquiries from securities regulatory bodies in the relevant jurisdictions where FF does business.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5UrOF"&gt;Jia is now Faraday Future’s “Chief Product and User Ecosystem Officer,” and he remains on the startup’s executive management committee. And repercussions from his actions continue to pop up, too, as just last week he was &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-04-14/jia-yueting-other-leshi-former-executives-banned-from-securities-market-for-life-101690802.html"&gt;banned for life from the securities market in China&lt;/a&gt; for “fraud” committed at LeEco. Faraday Future also says in the S-4 that its subsidiaries in China — many of them LeEco-related — are involved in around 90 legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="owq3zs"&gt;Faraday Future had just $1 million in the bank at the end of 2020 and suffered steep losses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LANhLK"&gt;Faraday Future has spent the last few years treading financial waters, and this new filing shows how close it was to going under. Previously, the best idea of how much cash the startup had on hand came from Jia’s bankruptcy filings, which showed that Faraday Future had around $6 million in the bank by July 2019. Now, we can see that Faraday Future finished 2019 with just $2.2 million in cash and 2020 with just $1.1 million in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXWTGi"&gt;Those are measly figures when compared to the annual losses Faraday Future has recently posted: $142 million in 2019 and $147 million in 2020. In its near seven-year history, Faraday Future has spent some $2 billion total without generating any revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iCwmvM"&gt;Working with a restructuring firm in 2019 likely saved Faraday Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="025ArV"&gt;How did this startup survive for years with only that much cash in the bank and around $800 million in current liabilities? It took on more debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMNlTu"&gt;Faraday Future is very possibly only still around because of a deal it struck in April 2019 with Birch Lake Associates, a Chicago-based merchant bank that advises restructurings and is run by what one expert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18524108/faraday-future-bankruptcy-expert-birch-lake-loan"&gt;described to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time&lt;/a&gt; as a “bankruptcy legend.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdKxoK"&gt;Throughout the S-4, Birch Lake’s fingerprints are all over the last two years of Faraday Future. Birch Lake arranged to have tens of millions of dollars loaned to Faraday Future in 2019, shortly after the startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/31/18162827/faraday-future-evergrande-settlement-restructuring-china-ev-investor"&gt;broke up with its biggest outside investor, Chinese conglomerate Evergrande&lt;/a&gt;. Birch Lake has also helped consolidate and refinance some of Faraday Future’s old debt that was either coming due or in default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B3Pp9E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup’s been working with a “bankruptcy legend” for two years to turn things around&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKlGlH"&gt;One of the key things Birch Lake was involved in, though, was creating a so-called “vendor trust.” At the time that Birch Lake started working with Faraday Future, the startup owed more than $100 million to the suppliers of components for its electric SUV. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18243015/faraday-future-money-lawsuits-employees"&gt;many of those suppliers weren’t getting paid&lt;/a&gt;. Since Faraday Future didn’t have much money, Birch Lake helped solve this by setting up a trust that let suppliers essentially exchange their debt claims for what became small ownership stakes in the startup, which could pay out if and when Faraday Future went public or got bought — a deal that probably looks much better now than when those companies took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b5ZXQv"&gt;A 2019 deal with a Chinese gaming company never went anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5cH00H"&gt;After it announced the deal with Birch Lake, Faraday Future also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/24/18279785/faraday-future-the9-china-car-investment-deal"&gt;announced a potential investment from Chinese gaming company The9&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies were supposed to start up a joint venture in China that would see The9 contribute up to $600 million and Faraday Future develop an electric minivan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUsCjs"&gt;But neither side ever really spoke about that effort again following the announcement, and based on The9’s own financial filings, it’s been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1290746176350887942"&gt;clear since last August&lt;/a&gt; that the deal was dead. Faraday Future basically confirms this in its S-4, saying the deal is “dormant.” The9 &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;make an initial deposit of $5 million when the companies agreed to the deal in 2019 as a commitment, but that’s since been converted to stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OPKpU"&gt;(Another partnership with commercial powertrain company US Hybrid, &lt;a href="https://www.ff.com/us/press-room/ff-collaboration-with-US-hybrid/"&gt;announced in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is mentioned nowhere in the S-4.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UFa9kC"&gt;Faraday Future and LeEco’s separate electric car efforts weren’t so separate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uUL3L7"&gt;This likely won’t surprise anyone who has followed Faraday Future or Jia closely, but at one point, both of his companies were working on electric cars, seemingly at odds. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16334780/faraday-future-leeco-lesee-electric-car-patents"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/leecos-car-was-designed-by-faraday-future-employees-who-1790163868"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/priya/turmoil-at-faraday-future#.ysKaOl7Ye"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have reported, the two projects actually had a lot of overlap, despite the companies maintaining at the time that they were distinct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJdSfH"&gt;But there’s a stark admission in the S-4 that finally drops the veil: LeSee, which was the brand for LeEco’s EV project, was treated as a subsidiary of Faraday Future and was considered the startup’s “primary Chinese operating entity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A77ZgN"&gt;Neither were their finances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TZAYiD"&gt;Another thing that has been previously reported, but now there are concrete details in the filing that partially describe some of the many loans Jia Yueting used to move money throughout his empire. Leview Mobile, a LeEco-related company, loaned $67 million to Faraday Future in 2018. LeSee, meanwhile, borrowed nearly $30 million from a Chinese entity controlled by Jia that also was the beneficial owner of Faraday Future’s Hong Kong subsidiary. In 2017, Faraday Future borrowed nearly $9 million from a small bank that Jia owned in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CPdF5"&gt;Faraday Future also borrowed multiple times from unnamed employees starting in 2017 and running through 2020, ranging from as low as $700,000 and as high as multiple millions. In one case, Faraday Future says it borrowed $16 million from a company owned by an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNqjim"&gt;Jia’s bankruptcy filings also shed light on some of these loans in 2020, including the $16 million one, which was actually &lt;em&gt;originally &lt;/em&gt;funded by the company’s “&lt;a href="https://www.ff.com/us/press-room/a-letter-to-creditors/"&gt;global partners&lt;/a&gt;” committee but was first passed through a Delaware LLC whose president is Faraday Future’s head of investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9Urrj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrlIRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uWOpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
