    <title>TikTok now has an official Android TV app, sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3WR9tailuRPlrWXvzXti_pX3A4=/159x0:1743x1056/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68764226/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_10.17.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvL5Q3"&gt;TikTok has come to Google’s Android TV platform, marking the short video app’s latest expansion to big screens, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-android-tv-google-tv/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Though the app is &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tiktok.tv"&gt;currently on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, it seems to not be working in every region yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YV03o"&gt;The Android TV take on TikTok looks remarkably similar to the TikTok app that arrived on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;Samsung TVs in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Videos play vertically (just like in the phone app) in a scrollable main feed, with access to specific categories of videos, and your profile is also available to browse. I haven’t been able to download it on my Chromecast with Google TV to test, but it appears to be a more fully featured option than what TikTok launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;on Amazon’s Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;, which got a curated selection of videos from TikTok that didn’t require an account to see.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWWKEz"&gt;Many users have been running into the issue of the app not working in their region, with one of the main exceptions being people downloading it in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/03/goodbye-productivity-tiktok-is-now-available-for-android-tv/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Reddit users have also run into the problem even when trying to sideload the app onto other Android TV devices. The app loads, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/lba9dc/tiktok_for_android_tv/glv4dn2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;when one user tried to log in&lt;/a&gt;, they were told that the TikTok app was not available in their region yet. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to TikTok for comment on the app’s availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMoiOg"&gt;If you’d like to test it for yourself, you can download the new Android TV TikTok experience &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tiktok.tv"&gt;from the Play Store now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bezos’ Amazon: from bookstore to backbone of the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GI-ehqYygGtAlSBqN8ar1Rq9syg=/0x0:1638x1092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68764191/jeff_bezos_robot_dog_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Credit: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/975847153468768256" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Bezos / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0AX3LA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ departure&lt;/a&gt; from the day-to-day responsibilities of running Amazon will be the first time the founder hasn’t driven the company as CEO in 26 years. Bezos built Amazon up from a small online bookstore to the massive conglomerate with dealings in cloud computing, groceries, physical retail, personal electronics, TV and film production, video games, and more that the company is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxVIBR"&gt;To get a sense of how much Amazon owes to Bezos, here’s a look back at Bezos’ history with the company, and an idea of the scope of what he’ll be leaving behind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="09augv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oidoPm"&gt;In 1994, hedge fund vice president Jeff Bezos, 30, quit his job at D. E. Shaw &amp;amp; Co. to found an internet-based bookstore. It launched in July 1995; the first book sold was &lt;em&gt;Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought&lt;/em&gt;. Within two months, the company sold books in all 50 states but was viewed as a bit player in the publishing industry compared to heavyweights like Barnes and Noble or Borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ep2M8R"&gt;In July 1996, Amazon introduced its Affiliate Program, which rewards other websites for referring traffic to Amazon books. The program continues to this day and is a key part of Amazon’s e-commerce profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79uy25"&gt;On May 15th, 1997, &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-inc-announces-initial-public-offering-3000000-shares"&gt;Amazon held its IPO&lt;/a&gt;, trading under AMZN at $18 a share. (At publication, Amazon’s stock trades for $3,380 a share.) Amazon was still losing money at the time, despite an 800 percent increase in revenue that year. But Bezos told &lt;a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/Shareholderletter97.pdf"&gt;shareholders that year&lt;/a&gt; the company was focused on long-term investments, not just short-term profit. Later that year, Amazon also introduced its patented “1-Click” shopping button, which allows customers to buy books from Amazon and have them shipped with a single press of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I3UN3V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon was focused on long-term investments, not just short-term profit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3vN1aF"&gt;In 1998, Amazon bought the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for approximately $55 million, in the company’s first major acquisition. It also expanded its storefront for the first time:  Amazon now sold CDs and DVDs, too. The company would continue to grow, adding new product categories over the following months and years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUPeRe"&gt;In 2000, Amazon opened the Amazon Marketplace, which let others sell products on its site. People could sell used books, DVDs, and other products alongside Amazon’s own sales pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BabcAZ"&gt;In 2003, Amazon, for the first time in its history, turned an annual &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2575106/amazon-records-first-profitable-year-in-its-history.html"&gt;profit&lt;/a&gt; of $75 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixHmcY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7wUDjM"&gt;In 2005, Amazon Prime was introduced, offering customers free two-day shipping within the continental US for $79 per year. This was Amazon’s first foray into subscription services, and it would become one of the company’s best-known products. Prime subscriptions cemented Amazon’s place in the retail marketplace — with two-day shipping, it was now almost more convenient to order a product or book from Amazon than it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WIRED/status/1356742836230774789"&gt;was to go to a retail store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wijN5G"&gt;In 2006, Amazon debuted one of its most significant products: the web server product that would come to be known as Amazon Web Services, or AWS. AWS was a commercial product that would provide the backbone for companies to run their own internet businesses from the cloud. The launch also gave Amazon years of a head start on its eventual competitors, like Microsoft Azure (which was first available in 2010) and Google Cloud (in 2008). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFRJHR"&gt;In September 2007, Amazon made its first entry into digital music with Amazon MP3, an online music store. Amazon’s storefront sold MP3 files without digital-rights management copy protection, and it was the first DRM-free music store to offer music from all four major labels. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3cj33CjdyQlgn9FUfK6LHyoOt08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278784/kindle.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Amazon Kindle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0Yb0Qx"&gt;In November 2007, Amazon’s first major hardware product went on sale: the Amazon Kindle e-reader. While E Ink-based e-readers had been popular overseas for some time, the Kindle — combined with Amazon’s Kindle Store for buying ebooks, usually for a significant discount over their ink-and-paper counterparts — helped popularize the concept in the US for the first time. The company that started selling physical books on a digital site now sold physical devices to read digital books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPHmpj"&gt;In August 2007, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/08/01/remember-webvan-so-does-amazon/?_ga=2.181684398.804959276.1612275879-1132714455.1609968950"&gt;Amazon Fresh&lt;/a&gt;, a local grocery delivery service, opened in Seattle as an invite-only service. The service eventually &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/amazon-bets-on-web-groceries-expands-amazonfresh-to-l-a/"&gt;expanded to other cities six years later in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. The extended time it took Amazon to roll out Fresh highlighted the difficulties of selling fresh groceries at scale through the internet, a problem the company continued to grapple with in subsequent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ip3e"&gt;In September 2009, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-09-20-amazonbasics-bezos-and-co-starts-private-label-consumer-electr.html"&gt;Amazon made its biggest foray&lt;/a&gt; into creating its own line of products with AmazonBasics, its in-house label for “essential accessories.” The label is controversial to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2016/04/20/amazon-copies-merchants/"&gt;some Amazon sellers&lt;/a&gt;, who alleged &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/business/amazon-the-brand-buster.html"&gt;that Amazon shepherds customers&lt;/a&gt; to buy AmazonBasics products over their own. There are also accusations that Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-competition-shopify-wayfair-allbirds-antitrust-11608235127"&gt;copies third-party products&lt;/a&gt; to sell under the AmazonBasics brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1fAmg"&gt;In July 2009, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/22/amazon-buys-zappos/"&gt;Amazon bought Zappos for $928 million&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2010, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/30/woot-amazon/"&gt;Amazon bought Woot for $110 million&lt;/a&gt;. The two acquisitions further expanded Amazon’s control over internet commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6tPCv"&gt;In February 2011, Amazon expanded its digital video service &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-22-amazon-launches-prime-instant-videos-unlimited-streaming-for-pr.html"&gt;into Amazon Prime Instant Video&lt;/a&gt;, establishing Amazon’s first foothold into the streaming marketplace. In addition to purchasing movies and TV shows, Amazon Prime members could stream content from a library of over 5,000 shows and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7FlMa"&gt;In March 2011, Amazon announced the Amazon Appstore for Android. While the Google Play Store remained the primary storefront for Android, the Amazon Appstore offered developers a new venue to sell applications for mobile devices. Later that year, the company launched its first Android tablet: &lt;a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/live-blogging-the-amazon-tablet-announcement/"&gt;the $199 Kindle Fire Tablet&lt;/a&gt;, the first in a series of budget Android tablets from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOtrzX"&gt;In April 2012, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/18/2957743/amazon-aws-internet-usage-statistics"&gt;report from DeepField Networks concluded&lt;/a&gt; that 1 percent of all consumer internet traffic interacts with AWS servers, with a third of internet users using Amazon servers at least once a day. Notable companies relying on Amazon’s servers by this point include &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2945757/netflix-simian-army-cloud-monkey-open-source"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, and Zynga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsXBfD"&gt;In April 2013, Amazon released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/19/4236092/amazon-studios-debuting-14-original-pilots-free-streaming"&gt;first original streaming content&lt;/a&gt;: 14 original series pilots produced by Amazon Studios, its content production group. The shows are, for the most part, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/24/4260916/prime-time-amazon-shows-are-terrible"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08RBqb"&gt;On December 1st, 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-drones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hour-shipping"&gt;Bezos formally announced&lt;/a&gt; Amazon Prime Air on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;. Prime Air was a wildly ambitious program that would use miniature delivery drones to bring packages to customers’ doorsteps in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/2/5166948/here-are-the-things-amazon-needs-to-get-its-delivery-drones-off-the-ground"&gt;under a half an hour&lt;/a&gt;. The program &lt;a href="http://e"&gt;has yet to debut commercially&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the largest unfinished products of Bezos’ tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k5fHXW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQ2pP4PXtg_ynlkuhPmSdDgU93Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19309199/fire_phone_027_2040.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8MOZim"&gt;2014 was Amazon’s most significant year for consumer hardware. The company kicked things off in April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/2/5573818/amazon-announces-fire-tv"&gt;with the Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;, a $99 set-top box designed to compete with Apple and Roku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m82wwA"&gt;After years of rumors, in July 2014, Amazon released its biggest hardware bet yet: the Amazon Fire Phone, an Android-based smartphone that also served as a gateway to all of Amazon’s various content and shopping services. A key selling point was the unique camera array, which promised a head-tracking feature, along with “Firefly,” a camera-based shopping app for scanning and buying items off of Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZ38Xq"&gt;In August 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/25/6066295/amazon-reportedly-buying-twitch-for-over-1-billion"&gt;Amazon announced&lt;/a&gt; it was buying the popular video game streaming website Twitch for $970 million. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Echo and books" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIQw90GszagHzixZ-lFp4sMQMSw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2934174/amazon-echo-verge-9713.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l15FvE"&gt;On November 6th, 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7167793/amazon-echo-speaker-announced"&gt;Amazon released the Echo&lt;/a&gt;, a speaker equipped with microphones, so that users can talk to an integrated digital assistant called Alexa. Originally, the Echo was limited to Prime members, but Amazon eventually opened up sales to everyone on June 23rd, 2015. The Echo speaker was a huge success for Amazon, and it helped launch the entire smart speaker product category. Today, the Echo is just one of many smart speakers available, with Google Assistant and Apple’s HomePod products all competing for a spot in customers’ living rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtVDAK"&gt;Amazon started off 2015 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/11/7529327/golden-globe-winner-best-tv-comedy"&gt;Golden Globe award for best TV comedy or musical&lt;/a&gt; for Prime original series &lt;em&gt;Transparent&lt;/em&gt;, the first major award for the company’s original content. Amazon had moved from a pile of unpopular pilots to the company behind one of TV’s best shows in just two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmY8Qn"&gt;To celebrate the company’s 20th anniversary, Amazon held its first “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/15/8968881/amazon-prime-day-best-deals"&gt;Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;” event on July 15th, 2015: a combination warehouse clearance sale and Black Friday-style deal event. It’s been held annually since and is now one of Amazon’s highest-volume shopping days of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hwiRL"&gt;In September 2015, Amazon announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9292695/amazon-fire-phone-sales-end"&gt;discontinuing the Fire Phone&lt;/a&gt;, just over a year after it was introduced. The product was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5923697/amazon-fire-phone-review"&gt;poorly received&lt;/a&gt; by both customers and reviewers, and it remains one of Amazon’s most notable product failures to date. Amazon hasn’t made another smartphone since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmmXVp"&gt;In November 2015, after starting life as a digital bookstore, Amazon opened its first physical bookshop in Seattle, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9661556/amazon-books-first-physical-bookstore-opening-seattle"&gt;called Amazon Books&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the company has continued to expand Amazon Books stores in other locations across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eugy7JTJa7WmxHdywzT1xEgk22I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278803/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_12.34.41_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3yYW7c"&gt;In October 2016, Amazon Music expanded with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/12/13244158/amazon-music-unlimited-launch-echo-availability-price"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, a full-fledged streaming service that was designed to compete with products like Spotify and Apple Music. At launch, it cost $7.99 per month for Prime subscribers, or just $3.99 per month for Echo owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpS5r8"&gt;In December 2016, the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13842592/amazon-go-new-cashier-less-convenience-store"&gt;Amazon Go convenience store&lt;/a&gt; opened in Seattle. The store used cameras and sensors to track what items customers take off of shelves and out of the store, charging them automatically. No cashiers or checkout lines needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMqEwo"&gt;At the 87th Academy Awards in 2017, Amazon became the first streaming service to win an Oscar, taking home Best Actor and Best Screenplay for &lt;em&gt;Manchester By The Sea&lt;/em&gt; (which was also nominated for Best Picture that year). The company also won best foreign language film for &lt;em&gt;The Salesman&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oOld8n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The whole picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CiSCr1"&gt;In June 2017, Amazon made its biggest purchase ever: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15816174/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition-supermarket-stores"&gt;landmark $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;. The upscale food chain wasn’t rebranded as an Amazon product. Rather, Amazon primarily integrated Whole Foods into its local grocery delivery services like Prime Now, vastly expanding its inventory to bring customers fresh foods directly from stores. Prime customers could also expect special deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkra7P"&gt;In September 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16266004/amazon-second-headquarters-north-america-seattle-2hq"&gt;Amazon announced plans&lt;/a&gt; for a second headquarters. As part of the announcement, the company asked cities across North America to pitch it on where it should set up shop next. For the next year, cities scrambled to offer Amazon a series of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16504042/amazon-hq2-second-headquarters-most-funny-crazy-pitches-proposals-stonecrest-new-york"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18079160/amazon-hq2-bids-process-cities-queens-arlington-nashville-crystal-city"&gt;tax breaks, and subsidiaries&lt;/a&gt; to host the headquarters. After all that, in November 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/17977814/amazon-hq2-queens-arlington-us-locations"&gt;Amazon announced its “HQ2” headquarters&lt;/a&gt; would be &lt;em&gt;split &lt;/em&gt;between Long Island City in NYC and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="66MLHj"&gt;In February 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059664/amazon-ring-acquisition-smart-home-security-cloud-cam"&gt;Amazon bought&lt;/a&gt; home security company Ring for more than $1 billion. The acquisition didn’t just give Amazon a commanding position in the home security market — it gave the company a key outlet to expand its smart home gadgets built around its Alexa assistant. Since the Amazon acquisition, Ring has been criticized by privacy advocates for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;close ties&lt;/a&gt; with law enforcement agencies that allow &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/cute-videos-little-evidence-police-say-amazon-ring-isn-t-n1136026"&gt;police or fire departments to request video footage&lt;/a&gt; from the company’s cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgzyx4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;Amazon’s market cap briefly crossed $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in September 2018; Amazon was just the third company in history to achieve that high a valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4kBjb"&gt;In April 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516795/amazon-prime-free-one-day-shipping-update-earnings"&gt;Amazon announced plans to further improve its Prime delivery promise&lt;/a&gt;: instead of offering two-day shipping for products, Amazon would now be offering one-day shipping for Prime members. The investment, while costly, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-results/amazon-holiday-sales-jump-as-one-day-shipping-pays-dividends-stock-up-13-idUSKBN1ZT2XU"&gt;paid off for Amazon in the long term&lt;/a&gt; with increases in both Prime subscriptions and overall sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9048EH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224993/amazon-hq-2-queens-new-york-backlash-pulls-drops"&gt;Amazon canceled its plans&lt;/a&gt; for a New York City headquarters in February 2019, following backlash from residents and local politicians. They objected to Amazon’s promise that the new headquarters would result in an influx of new jobs; locals were concerned that the new Amazon HQ would bring a rush of outsider tech workers who would in turn push out existing residents and drive up living costs in Queens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ2jYC"&gt;On May 5th, 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20"&gt;Amazon released its years-in-the-making video game, &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The game was available for just over a month before it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;pulled&lt;/a&gt; as the game’s development team went back to rework the title. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; was then canceled entirely in October&lt;/a&gt;. It was a particularly notable moment for Amazon’s gaming ambitions. Despite years of investment into Amazon Game Studios and ownership of Twitch, the largest social gaming space on the internet, Amazon had once again failed to make any real impact as a video game creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Saag"&gt;In August 2020, Amazon launched the first “Amazon Fresh” branded grocery store in Woodland Hills, California. The store was notably &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a Whole Foods store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;but was designed as a cheaper alternative&lt;/a&gt; that more closely ties into Amazon’s services and products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25ogbNUdPwpyUGaUDCjgqILPgGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21975085/_DSC6805_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ8dSj"&gt;At the end of September 2020, Amazon announced Luna. Like Google’s Stadia, Luna was a game streaming service that leveraged the company’s cloud backend to stream video games to devices over the internet. Luna was just a platform for playing third-party titles, though, with not much to offer compared to traditional game consoles beyond the questionable convenience of outsourcing the actual processing to a cloud server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsD0iK"&gt;And on February 2nd, 2021: Bezos announced that he’ll be stepping down as Amazon’s CEO later in 2021, marking the end of his tenure at the head of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKEorc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Destruction AllStars turns on voice chat by default, and it’s obnoxious</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9u2kFBnZ0GaxTow-1Kv_RozBeu0=/0x0:1013x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68763808/destruction_all_stars_screenshots_14_disclaimer_ps5_en_15oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cE9VzO"&gt;Players who have jumped into Sony’s new car-smashing PS5 game &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; may have run into a rather obnoxious issue: voice chat in the game’s multiplayer matches is switched on by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5foiM"&gt;In one round, I was subjected to somebody’s music blaring in the background for the entirety of the match. In another, I heard every word of someone teaching their friend how to play the game. &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-mute-jerks-in-destruction-allstars-1846188716"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; collected many more examples&lt;/a&gt; of people being frustrated by the default voice chat, and it sounds like many heard far worse things than I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8faej"&gt;The DualSense’s integrated mic compounds the problem. Unless you proactively hit the mute button, that mic is going to pick up everything going on around you and broadcast it to your fellow players. Voice chats you hear during a match will also play out of the DualSense’s integrated speaker if you don’t have a headset hooked up, much to the potential chagrin of anyone sitting next to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uxece"&gt;Frustratingly, there isn’t an immediately obvious way to turn voice chat off. I couldn’t find any option to do so in the game’s menus, and I only learned through scouring the internet after playing the game on Tuesday that you have to disable voice chat in PS5’s menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oezPf"&gt;To do so, while you’re in a match, hit the PlayStation button, scroll up to the Activity Cards above the bottom row of icons, navigate to the voice chat card, and hit the square button. Annoyingly, though, this only disables voice chat for one match — you’ll have to go through the process again every match to mute your fellow players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fH6rgV"&gt;Hopefully Sony addresses this issue soon with a patch or fix of some kind. But for now, you’ll be hearing a lot of voice chats unless you turn them off every game. &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; is available now as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534475/destruction-all-stars-ps5-launch-title-delayed-ps-plus-february-2021"&gt;free download&lt;/a&gt; for PlayStation Plus subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The 2019 CERAWeek Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0fhKcOZF4jXhEyGxof2whohQXLo=/0x0:4533x3022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68763687/1129882599.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The exec helped Amazon soar in the cloud, and now he’ll determine the company’s future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KheqE5"&gt;Amazon is getting a new CEO for the first time in its 27-year-history: cloud computing chief Andy Jassy, who will be replacing co-founder Jeff Bezos later this year. Jassy, currently the CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a core believer in Bezos’ business philosophies and a longtime veteran of the company, having run the cloud division since its inception nearly two decades ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaEWB8"&gt;Jassy, who turned 53 last year, is now getting the opportunity to make his mark not just on Amazon, but also the world and the major ways the company shaped it, from Whole Foods to a million-person-plus warehouse workforce to massive logistics and AI divisions with far-reaching real-world effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A7BnGv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Andy Jassy transformed AWS into a $50 billion a year business, and now he will lead all of Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AG2Ko5"&gt;Far from a household name, Jassy is still one of the most consequential executives in Amazon’s history. His promotion underscores the importance of cloud computing to the biggest tech titans that now play vital roles in powering the entire internet. In the case of AWS, that includes everything from Netflix and Spotify to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Democratic National Committee.When AWS goes down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;huge chunks of the internet go with it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhB7ft"&gt;The transition of power is reminiscent of Satya Nadella’s promotion to the CEO role at Microsoft in 2014, after Nadella spent three years running the company’s Azure cloud business. Nadella modernized many elements of Microsoft’s business and company culture with a focus on the cloud and mobile computing, as well as an excellent eye for major acquisitions. Jassy’s ascent to the top job at Amazon may similarly usher in an era of transformation for the e-commerce giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xAygu"&gt;The big question Amazon insiders and those on the outside looking in will try to answer in the next six months, before he takes the job in the third quarter of the year, will be whether Jassy deviates from Bezos’ approach or sticks to business as usual. Yet if Jassy continues to see himself as an acolyte of Bezos and his &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/21/what-is-jeff-bezos-day-1-philosophy/"&gt;famous “Day 1” mentality&lt;/a&gt; — which argues that companies start to decline and die the moment they rest on their laurels — it will mean plenty of change is on the horizon. For Amazon, change is both the most important survival instinct and its most successful business tool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jCIrAzyoyLcMUf4m3ep1HUvkqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11453917/mdoying_180411_2466_0050stills.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5tQLuC"&gt;When Jassy joined Amazon in the late ‘90s, the company was years away from thinking about the cloud and still focused solely on e-commerce. Jassy graduated from Harvard Business School in 1997 and joined Amazon soon thereafter as part of a wave of fresh MBAs flocking to the tech industry before the dot-com boom. Jassy moved out West with the intention of one day returning to New York, according to an &lt;a href="https://thedisruptivevoice.libsyn.com/60-overcoming-the-capitalists-dilemma-with-andy-jassy-ceo-of-amazon-web-services"&gt;interview last year on &lt;em&gt;The Disruptive Voice &lt;/em&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, but he’s never held a job at another company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqVbMM"&gt;Jassy went on to become Bezos’ first “shadow” adviser, something like a corporate chief of staff who followed the CEO every day and sat in on all of his meetings, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andy-jassy-amazon-web-services-ceo-2021-1"&gt;profile of Jassy published late last month by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Jassy also made a peculiar first impression on his boss by accidentally hitting him in the head with a kayak paddle during a characteristically competitive game of company broomball, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/jeff-bezos-steps-down-heralding-new-era-for-amazon"&gt;recounted in Brad Stone’s 2013 book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WXEOka"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“So very quietly around 2000, we became a services company with really no fanfare.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kh2FcC"&gt;Bezos and Jassy’s relationship deepened in the years after, with Bezos tasking his younger lieutenant with exploring the then-nascent technology of cloud computing around 2003. The goal was to see whether it made sense for Amazon to offer hosting services to other websites and businesses, back when many of the largest tech companies mainly relied on third-party data centers or had already begun looking into or actively building their own. The idea came from Amazon’s own struggles to build an external development platform for retailers three years earlier, so third-party companies could build their own e-commerce operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaJiyQ"&gt;It was Jassy who helped identify the problem: Amazon’s development tools, frankly, sucked. The company set out to improve them by creating easier-to-use APIs and other technology that would let any one team at Amazon pull from a common pool of resources. “So very quietly around 2000, we became a services company with really no fanfare,” Jassy told a crowd at the re:Invent conference in 2018, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yp4sYA"&gt;It took Amazon another six years of exploring and experimenting — with the effort to formally develop AWS really taking off after a fateful 2003 executive retreat at Bezos’ house, Jassy recounted — before the company launched its first cloud product in 2006. “In retrospect it [AWS] seems fairly obvious, but at the time I don’t think we had ever really internalized that,” Jassy said at re:Invent. The company’s early investments paid off, as it took competitors years to realize the business opportunity and launch comparable cloud products.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4SvkqX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The operating system becomes the internet.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBAc05"&gt;“If you believe companies will build applications from scratch on top of the infrastructure services if the right selection [of services] existed, and we believed they would if the right selection existed, then the operating system becomes the internet, which is really different from what had been the case for the [previous] 30 years,” Jassy explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOFGe6"&gt;That belief about the future of the internet proved prescient. Today, AWS powers a huge bulk of apps, services, and websites consumers and employees use every day, largely because Amazon has unparalleled resources and developer tools that make building and tapping into its massive resources as easy as using a standard API. It’s why so many companies forgo building their own data center operations and instead choose AWS or one of its competitors. Unless you’re Facebook or Google, both of which built out their own global data center operations, it’s simply easier to use Amazon than to do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btMEw0osY3ea4z76kDVMyLjMtqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278682/670451730.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kJgZmk"&gt;Jassy deserves credit for architecting the company’s cloud vision, having run AWS since it was created and becoming its CEO after Bezos promoted him to the position from a senior vice president role back in 2016. His tenure at AWS has also turned cloud computing into the most profitable of Amazon’s divisions, accounting for roughly 63 percent of the company’s profits in 2020 and putting it on track to make more than $50 billion in revenue this year. Amazon now controls about a third of the entire cloud infrastructure market, more than its next closest competitors (Microsoft and Google) combined, &lt;a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/quarterly-cloud-spending-blows-past-30b-incremental-growth-continues-rise"&gt;according to Synergy Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2teyP"&gt;Without AWS’s momentous growth, Amazon may not have had the resources to invest as much money back into its retail, logistics, streaming video, hardware, smart home, AI, and other divisions over the years. That makes AWS effectively the engine of Amazon’s continuous reinvention, and Jassy is the spark that helps drive it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLr1v2"&gt;In recent years, Jassy has clearly fashioned himself as an heir apparent to Bezos, spinning tales of Amazon’s early days and the remarkable beginnings of AWS and how those learnings can be applied to other businesses. He’s a keynote speaker at Amazon’s high-profile re:Invent conference, an industry gathering dedicated to cloud computing, and he’s become a more public face of Amazon in recent years. Last summer, when longtime logistics executive Jeff Wilke, another potential Bezos successor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395776/amazon-executive-wilke-retire-logistics-consumer-division"&gt;announced his retirement&lt;/a&gt;, the writing was on the wall. Someone would eventually take over from Bezos, and it was looking more likely than ever to be Jassy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WRylBV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AWS has become the engine of Amazon’s continuous reinvention&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z1zqB2"&gt;Jassy’s management quirks and persona have also become somewhat legendary within the company, similar to Bezos’ infamous email style and meeting decorum. Jassy is known internally for his exhaustive attention to detail and hands-on approach, his penchant for back-to-back meetings, and his welcoming embrace of social justice issues, according to&lt;em&gt; Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlSsuA"&gt;In September, he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy/status/1309176233117257728"&gt;tweeted publicly&lt;/a&gt; about accountability for the killing of Breonna Taylor, and he’s been outspoken in his support for the Black Lives Matter movement and LGBTQ issues. Jassy, however, is also known for &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/amazon-aws-ceo-andy-jassy-defends-facial-recognition-sales-law-enforcement-says-would-sell-to-foreign-governments/"&gt;having defended controversial decisions&lt;/a&gt;, like Amazon’s sale of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18291995/amazon-facial-recognition-technology-rekognition-police-ai-researchers-ban-flawed"&gt;reportedly flawed facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; to police departments and the government. (Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;announced a one-year ban&lt;/a&gt; on its sale of the tech to law enforcement starting in June of last year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTGubZ"&gt;Jassy’s approach is also characterized as one of making tough and unprecedented calls, best exemplified in AWS’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;decision to ban social media platform Parler&lt;/a&gt; last month following the US Capitol riot. It was a move the company did not take lightly considering its “religious” commitment to maintaining service for customers, &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported at the time. But it felt compelled to do so after outcry from employees and because Parler posed “a very real risk to public safety,” Amazon said in a statement at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="OPRZ6E"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZ3k7Fd6_eU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qOuStj"&gt;Jassy will no doubt be in charge of making even tougher calls in the future. But that’s part of both the job and the Amazon culture he’s helped cultivate. “It’s really hard to build a business that sustains for a long period of time,” Jassy told a virtual crowd at the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ3k7Fd6_eU"&gt;all-digital Amazon re:Invent&lt;/a&gt; last December. “To do it, you’re going to reinvent yourself, and often you’re going to have to reinvent yourself many times over.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azLRZ0"&gt;That’s precisely what Amazon has done over the years, transforming from an online bookseller into an e-commerce giant and onward into a hardware maker, a major Hollywood and entertainment industry player, and now the second largest employer in the country. All the while, Jassy has worked behind the scenes to ensure AWS was growing into the profit machine it is today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EUhDLA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You want to be reinventing all the time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qd4Iv8"&gt;Now, Jassy appears ready for a reinvention of his own, at a time when Amazon is still at the forefront of so many industries and continuing to explore new territory, all while it faces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;increasing antitrust pressure&lt;/a&gt; in the US and overseas and mounting competition in the AI, cloud, and e-commerce industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RrU9b6"&gt;“Typically, what you see is the desperate kind of reinvention — companies on the verge of falling apart or going bankrupt, deciding they have to reinvent themselves. When you wait until that point, it’s a crapshoot whether you’re going to be successful or not,” Jassy explained. “You want to be reinventing when you’re healthy. You want to be reinventing all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic was inescapable at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NemaTT9T1E4kRC39NlvRbVep578=/101x0:1948x1231/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68763351/50629625028_f97ee27b84_k.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d3eEQ6"&gt;For the first time since its inception, this year’s iteration of the Sundance Film Festival wasn’t held in picturesque Park City, Utah. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the showcase turned into a virtual event. Promising directors were still on hand to showcase their work, but viewers were able to watch them from the comfort of their living rooms. It wasn’t just the way films were presented that changed, though. The pandemic also impacted how many of these movies were made and what they’re about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dUesm"&gt;The shift is most obvious in films that are explicitly about the pandemic, of which there are several. For instance, &lt;em&gt;These Days&lt;/em&gt; is a pilot episode that stars Marianne Rendón and William Jackson Harper as two 20-somethings in New York struggling during the earlier stages of quarantine. Harper’s character is a culture journalist reporting stories about Zoom orgies, while Rendón is an aspiring dancer who feels like she’s falling behind since she can no longer dance. At one point, her best friend complains that she misses the early days of toilet paper hoarding and &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; binge-watching. It feels like a time capsule of early 2020: much of the movie takes place over Zoom calls, and director Adam Brooks says each actor was sent an equipment package so that they could film from their apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="93Gbm1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Pink Cloud is an eerily prescient sci-fi movie about being stuck in quarantine","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22261228/the-pink-cloud-review-sundance-film-festival-2021"},{"title":"Censor finds eerie horror in an ‘80s moral panic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22248895/censor-film-review-sundance-2021-video-nasties-moral-panic"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHipD2"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum is &lt;em&gt;In the Same Breath&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary from director Nanfu Wang (perhaps best known for 2019’s &lt;em&gt;One Child Nation&lt;/em&gt;), which presents a harrowing account of the early stages of the pandemic from Wuhan, China, the city where things started. Wang was able to actually get cameras inside of various hospitals in the city to get first-hand accounts from patients and their families. It paints a troubling picture of hospitals that were overwhelmed and unprepared for the sheer scale of infections and a government unwilling to admit fault. Wang, who was born in China but lives in America, then turns her attention to the US, where a similar pattern emerges. Even as someone who has followed news of the pandemic closely since it started, I still found &lt;em&gt;In the Same Breath&lt;/em&gt; an eye-opening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sez71l"&gt;(One of the most arresting movies of Sundance, &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt;, is about living a life under lockdown, but amazingly, it was written in 2017 and filmed in 2019, long before COVID dominated our lives. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22261228/the-pink-cloud-review-sundance-film-festival-2021"&gt;It’s eerily prescient&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9oFn4pKBlnUfxt2QtdrVT2oiqww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278241/50641388823_ec942c103b_k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Sundance Institute&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FFVzPj"&gt;In other films, the impact is more subtle. The disorienting horror movie &lt;em&gt;In the Earth&lt;/em&gt; is set amid a world ravaged by a deadly virus, but it mostly serves as a backdrop to a much stranger story about a fight against nature itself. Early on, you see people wearing masks and sanitizing their hands. But eventually, all of that goes away as the story moves in a very different direction, one centered on mythological creatures. Still, even these brief inclusions — things so common to everyday life now — serve to ground an otherwise manic film. The same goes for &lt;em&gt;Searchers&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about online dating, where there’s plenty of footage of people in masks wandering the streets of New York. This doesn’t really influence the stories people tell about their romantic lives. It’s set-dressing more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hceg7Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A Glitch in the Matrix is quirky, creepy, and way too unreal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22254064/glitch-in-the-matrix-film-review-rodney-ascher-sundance"},{"title":"Prisoners of the Ghostland is destined to be the next Nic Cage cult movie","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22260020/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-sundance-nic-cage-sion-sono"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWJAwc"&gt;The dramatic comedy &lt;em&gt;How It Ends&lt;/em&gt; isn’t about the pandemic in any way, but it’s clear that directors Daryl Wein and Zoe Lister-Jones had to find creative ways around distancing restrictions. The story is playfully dark. With an asteroid scheduled to destroy Earth, Liza (played by Lister-Jones) goes on a small adventure to wrap up some loose ends in her life: revealing to her parents how their absence made her feel, reconnecting with a lost friend, telling off an ex who cheated, and capping it off with a hopefully hedonistic party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeiYrD"&gt;It’s not a &lt;em&gt;Purge&lt;/em&gt;-style situation, though. This pre-apocalyptic movie is surprisingly quiet, as Liza wanders down mostly empty LA streets and stays six feet away from almost everyone. Strangely, it works. You do notice the distancing and emptiness, but it also puts a bigger focus on the characters and their performances, which are almost uniformly excellent. The limitations don’t end up hampering the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWkMUq"&gt;Of course, it’s not a surprise that the biggest story of 2020 would impact the world of film. The pandemic has changed the way all of us live and altered our relationship with entertainment. But what’s been fascinating at Sundance is seeing the many ways creators have dealt with it — whether it’s in the stories they tell or the logistical challenges of actually making a movie. And with things not changing anytime soon, it’s likely this year’s Sundance was just a preview of the next few years of film.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android TV’s latest update makes it look more like the Chromecast’s Google TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ECoA0_x5afyPAY0U3GK-o1pMxPQ=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68763208/android_tv_2021.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The newly refreshed Android TV home screen | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vyaonc"&gt;Google is rolling out a new update for Android TV that gives its smart TV OS a fresh new look — one that’s almost identical to the UI on the company’s Google TV software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;on its latest Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPKT1j"&gt;The new interface refreshes the look of Android TV to bring it more in line with Google TV, adding scrolling carousels of featured content on the top of the menus and ditching the oversized icons for more minimalist tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PR7EvQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Chromecast (2020) review: reinvented — and now with a remote","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ksrb87"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10316696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YbYik9"&gt;That said, there are a few differences between the UI on the Chromecast’s Google TV versus the refreshed Android TV. The new Android TV menu features three main tabs: home, for quickly accessing apps and channels; apps, as a dedicated place to find your applications; and a wholly new Discover tab, which will offer personalized recommendations for TV shows and movies, along with trending content from Google — similar to the “For You” tab on Google TV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WOSvnNXSHYpscnPJu3_KCQ2ygxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277104/Discover.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The newly added Discover tab for Android TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wE6iPg"&gt;Conversely, the Google TV UI uses that aforementioned “For You” tab as its home screen and then breaks out specific pieces of content into dedicated shows, movies, and live tabs, rather than collecting them all in one place. It also makes it easier to get to your purchase content through a library tab that Android TV lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iFo0F"&gt;It’s still a nice-looking update, though, that helps bring Google’s disparate smart TV platforms a little more in line — even if it remains slightly baffling that Google TV and Android TV still exist as separate products with different interfaces at this point in time. (Google is still planning to offer Google TV on newer smart TVs in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT6u3J"&gt;The updated Android TV UI will start rolling out today on Android TV OS devices in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, and France, with more countries promised to follow in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vMhpx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect’s Pinnacle Station DLC is forever lost due to data corruption</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mass Effect 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KsOhtqLuvOJoVabk4bYgQxXXjGY=/41x0:599x372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68763020/mass_effect_3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lfHNy1"&gt;The Pinnacle Station, a training facility added to the first &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, won’t appear in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alongside over 40 other pieces of downloadable content. &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/02/bioware-explains-pinnacle-station-dlc-exclusion-from-mass-effect-legendary-edition"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the Pinnacle Station, created by Demiurge Studios for the first game, can’t be salvaged due to data corruption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yBZMY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; repackages the original trilogy and all of its previously released content with new features and a major graphical overhaul. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Game Informer&lt;/em&gt;, game director Mac Walters said that trying to save the DLC was an “emotional roller coaster” that included reaching out to Demiurge and trying to obtain backups. Source code from the developer was corrupted. The original code source code has also been notoriously lost, which kept PlayStation 3 players from experiencing it when the game arrived on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aaj9a5"&gt;Re-creating the DLC would have taken six months with “most” of &lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;’s team, Walters said. “I wish we could do it. Honestly, just because this is meant to be everything that the team ever created, brought together again — all the single-player content. And so, leaving it all on the cutting-room floor, it was heartbreaking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LM3Mtq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition &lt;/em&gt;will launch on May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook designates Myanmar a ‘temporary high-risk location’ after coup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ISRAEL-MYANMAR-POLITICS-DEMO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuKLIZ9izzgsW2l8Ls7DNT71nPQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68762844/1230946144.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jack Guez / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s2AHfA"&gt;Facebook has designated Myanmar a “temporary high-risk location” after a coup earlier this week, saying it will remove “any calls to bring armaments” and protect posts criticizing the country’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iWbw6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/facebook-takes-stand-myanmar-coup"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s Asia-Pacific policy director, Rafael Frankel, outlined its coup response in a message to employees. Frankel pledged to employ “a number of product interventions that were used in the past in Myanmar and during the US elections, to ensure the platform isn’t being used to spread misinformation, incite violence, or coordinate harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jpNnv"&gt;Facebook declined to comment on the leaked post to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but it confirmed that a number of the measures it mentions are being put in place. “We are closely monitoring political events in Myanmar as they unfold and are taking additional steps to stop misinformation and content that could incite further tensions at this time,” a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This includes removing misinformation that delegitimizes the outcome of November’s election,” alongside hate speech and other misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88x5K6"&gt;Facebook says it’s taking temporary measures to reduce the spread of content that praises or supports post-election violence, automatically demoting potentially rule-breaking content while moderators make a decision on its removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IVJq4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; reports that Frankel said Facebook is securing the accounts of activists and journalists, as well as protecting “critical information about what’s happening on the ground.” While the military &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55889565"&gt;reportedly locked down overall internet access&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the coup, the disruption was apparently temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zng2if"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook removed a military TV network’s page&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj8pRJ"&gt;The post reportedly says Facebook is also attempting to track pages taken over by the military. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-myanmar-coup-facebook-bans-national-military-tv-networks-page-11612272870"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; wrote yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook had banned a page for a military television network, and Frankel said it was working to “stop misinformation and content that could incite further tensions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka3O5k"&gt;In 2018, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785522/facebook-myanmar-ethnic-violence-banned-accounts-military-genocide"&gt;purged many military accounts&lt;/a&gt; that helped incite genocidal violence against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority after the United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-un/myanmar-generals-had-genocidal-intent-against-rohingya-must-face-justice-u-n-idUSKCN1LC0KN"&gt;issued a report&lt;/a&gt; condemning Facebook’s “slow and ineffective” response. However, Facebook’s semi-independent oversight board recently overturned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;one ban of an anti-Muslim post&lt;/a&gt; in Myanmar, saying that it did not rise to the level of hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOhs6L"&gt;Facebook’s “temporary high-risk location” designation isn’t new. The label was applied to Washington, DC on January 6th after supporters of former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-labeled-us-a-high-risk-location-amid-capitol-riot-report-says/"&gt;attempted to overturn the results&lt;/a&gt; of the US election. The decision was followed by Facebook banning Trump from Facebook and Instagram — another decision that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;will soon be scrutinized&lt;/a&gt; by the oversight board.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok reduces India staff after long-standing countrywide ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TikTok Banned In India" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcO9_NPjD5NuV6g52bSKM1wjps0=/0x104:5035x3461/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759734/1223851409.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWGo7c"&gt;More than seven months after India issued a countrywide ban on TikTok, the app is significantly reducing its staffing in the country. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/TikTok-gives-up-on-India-months-after-government-ban"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that TikTok was “essentially withdrawing” from India, citing sources familiar with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arbpl7"&gt;Reached for comment, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed that it was reducing its workforce in India but disputed the details of &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzDLQ6"&gt;In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge: “&lt;/em&gt;Given the lack of feedback from the government about how to resolve this issue in the subsequent seven months, it is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India... [We] hope to get the chance to relaunch TikTok in India to support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVevEC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reported that “most” local employees were set to be laid off. The TikTok spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “well more than 100” would remain with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahfgGs"&gt;India was previously a large market for TikTok, which is owned by the Beijing-based firm ByteDance: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307014/india-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of TikTok’s downloads came from India as of April 2020. As of June, the app had about 167 million users in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I21jbv"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “It is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRDN0q"&gt;TikTok has been banned in India since June 29th. In its &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206#"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology stated that the apps were “engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Htorks"&gt;ByteDance, at the time, did not indicate plans to pull out. Following the announcement, the head of TikTok India issued a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTok_IN/status/1277811841364668416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1277811841364668416%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F29%2F21307014%2Findia-ban-tiktok-wechat-china-apps"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the company had not shared Indian users’ information with the Chinese government and that its practices were in compliance with India’s data privacy and security requirements. “We have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications,” the statement read. “We place the highest importance on user privacy and integrity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmDoKm"&gt;That wasn’t TikTok’s first quarrel with the Indian government. Indian lawmakers, including the information technology minister of Tamil Nadu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223590/tiktok-india-ban-legislation-government-teens"&gt;called for the app to be banned&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, citing concerns about the behavior of teens and young adults on the service. Apple and Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18411013/tiktok-india-google-play-block-apple-app-store-bytedance"&gt;pulled the app&lt;/a&gt; from their respective stores in India in mid-April, following a state court request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDDObX"&gt;That ban was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;lifted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18515035/tiktok-is-no-longer-banned-in-india"&gt;j&lt;/a&gt;ust over a week later, and didn’t impact folks who were already using TikTok; it merely prevented new downloads. Even so, TikTok claimed that it suffered up to $500,000 in losses each day the ban was in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsl3EM"&gt;“We are committed to continuously enhancing our safety features as a testament to our ongoing commitment to our users in India,” ByteDance said, following the lift of the ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YN5itf"&gt;Other countries have long-running security concerns with TikTok as well. The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;attempted&lt;/a&gt; to block transactions between ByteDance and US companies last year but was blocked from doing so by the courts. Several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150667/tsa-tiktok-employee-ban-bytedance-chuck-schumer-homeland-security"&gt;US government agencies&lt;/a&gt; have banned the use of the app on government-issued devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A01OJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 02/03/21 11:03AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added TikTok’s estimate of the number of local employees remaining with the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s electric Rivian vans will start making deliveries in 16 cities this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tg0xW5jCDzN1vPBt6_bgG2C5ZjQ=/0x1:611x408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68762710/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_10.29.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FsTkmh"&gt;Amazon’s new electric delivery vans will hit the road in more than a dozen cities starting this year, the company announced Wednesday. The vans, which are being designed and built by buzzy EV startup Rivian, are already making deliveries to customers in Los Angeles. Amazon plans to expand its testing to 15 more cities this year, as it continues to build toward &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;a fleet of 10,000 vehicles by 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The companies did not name which cities they would choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJZoCm"&gt;In a short video published today, Amazon touts the fact that the vans were designed, built, and are now being tested within a year. “We’re loving the enthusiasm from customers so far—from the photos we see online to the car fans who stop our drivers for a first-hand look at the vehicle,” said Ross Rachey, director of Amazon’s Global Fleet and Products, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazons-custom-electric-delivery-vehicles-are-starting-to-hit-the-road"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “From what we’ve seen, this is one of the fastest modern commercial electrification programs, and we’re incredibly proud of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aHfZl7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIt-QcxhZDc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o2nVpP"&gt;Rivian is a relatively new name in the electric vehicle industry, having only debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; at the end of November 2018 — despite operating in stealth since 2009. Originally founded to make something that competed with Tesla’s first car, the Roadster, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe"&gt;pivoted the company toward a more action-adventure customer segment&lt;/a&gt; of SUVs and pickup trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTaBrp"&gt;Since coming out of stealth, Rivian has hauled in a series of enormous investments from several major players. Amazon led a $700 million round in February 2019, followed by $500 million from Ford in April 2019. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238670/rivian-funding-amazon-electric-truck-suv"&gt;Rivian landed $2.65 billion&lt;/a&gt; from T. Rowe Price and Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. (Jeff Bezos recently announced he would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; to devote more attention to the initiative.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bfQCc"&gt;Rivian has shown off two vehicles so far: the R1T pickup and the R1S SUV. Built on the same architecture as the delivery van, Rivian claims its vehicles — which will start at around $70,000 — will be able to travel up to around 400 miles on a single charge, hit 60 miles per hour in under three seconds, and eventually be able to drive themselves in some capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKm9js"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;originally announced the new delivery van&lt;/a&gt; as part of its climate pledge to become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;a carbon-neutral company by 2040&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FKBqu"&gt;It’s funny that Amazon’s Rachey mentions the photos of the delivery van posted online. Curious passers-by have also captured the shall-we-say unique external sound that emanates from the van while parked or traveling at low speeds. Electric vehicles can be notably silent when compared to their internal combustion engine-having counterparts, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20869035/electric-car-ev-fake-noise-nhtsa"&gt;regulators require them to produce an artificial sound&lt;/a&gt; when traveling at low speeds to alert pedestrians and other road users that may not otherwise hear the approaching vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i5AOC"&gt;Based on the spacey, sci-fi-ish sound that has been selected, it would seem that Rivian was going for something that could best be described as “chill/lo-fi beats to relax/study to playlist.” &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/38717/listen-to-the-loud-irritating-noise-made-by-amazons-electric-rivian-delivery-vans"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; citing a post from &lt;em&gt;Drive Tesla Canada&lt;/em&gt;, the Rivian vans’ artificial sound is so loud, it can be heard from inside someone’s house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5K80pI"&gt;It’s not clear whether this will be the final sound used for all of Amazon’s delivery fleet. In other words, there’s still time to change it. Please change it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiFMwI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
