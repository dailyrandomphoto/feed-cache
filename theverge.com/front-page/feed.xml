    <title>Chrome for iOS will soon keep incognito tabs even more secret with Face ID</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x21rc4"&gt;Google is testing a new privacy feature to its Chrome browser for iOS that can lock incognito tabs behind Face ID. Apple’s facial recognition system is used to secure an iPhone or iPad, but many apps have their own Face ID support for extra security. Google has started testing securing incognito tabs behind Face ID in its latest Chrome iOS beta, signaling that it should arrive to regular users in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z2FpQ"&gt;Update notes for the latest Chrome 89 beta on iOS reveal that “when you return to the Chrome app, your incognito tabs will be blurred until you confirm it’s you.” You can enable this feature in the privacy section of Chrome’s settings, but it appears to be in early testing as not even every beta tester has access just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLAhxG"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google Chrome on iOS is getting Face ID support that will protect and secure incognito tabs    &lt;a href="https://t.co/gnQmOzjdV6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gnQmOzjdV6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1359956601730400258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="osssnP"&gt;Chrome 89 is expected to debut in early March, but it’s not clear if the Face ID support will be ready in time. Google is also supporting Touch ID, for older devices. This feature is similar to &lt;a href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/Samsung-Internet-Browser-Privacy-at-its-heart/td-p/5445029"&gt;Samsung’s secret mode&lt;/a&gt; in its mobile browser, which allows users to lock tabs with facial recognition or fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter permanently suspends conservative activist group Project Veritas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KhrNRsljQGa4gqzxIbUioeupZis=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808375/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CO78eV"&gt;Twitter has permanently suspended the account of conservative activist group Project Veritas, after the organization released a video of a reporter questioning a Facebook executive outside their home, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/11/us/impeachment-trial/twitter-suspends-project-veritas-a-conservative-group-over-tweets?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The account of Project Veritas’s founder, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII"&gt;James O’Keefe&lt;/a&gt;, was also temporarily locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uXt7N"&gt;In a statement given to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter said the @Project_Veritas account was suspended for “repeated violations of Twitter’s private information policy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xb5e1B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter says it repeatedly violated its private information policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h2n4f7"&gt;In a statement &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/11/project-veritas-suspended-twitter-468748"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Policito&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; O’Keefe said the offending video included footage of a reporter questioning Facebook vice president Guy Ronsen, but denied that Project Veritas had published his private information. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; notes that this questioning took place outside the executive’s home.  O’Keefe said the organization would not be taking down the offending coverage. “It would be unconscionable for me to take down our reporting where it didn’t violate anyone’s privacy rights,” he told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl1GjQ"&gt;After temporarily locking his account, Twitter said O’Keefe would need to delete a post that was in violation of its rules before he could tweet again. As of this writing, O’Keefe’s account is active once again, with two tweets labelled as unavailable on its feed. “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1360070705933672457"&gt;I’M BACK&lt;/a&gt;,” reads its pinned post, accompanied by a video outlining the group’s dispute with Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTWC6P"&gt;Prior to its suspension, Project Veritas’s Twitter account was prominent on the platform, and counted Donald Trump’s adult sons as followers. But others have questioned its tactics and the accuracy of its reporting. One of its videos about allegations of voter fraud was called “a domestic, coordinated elite disinformation campaign” by researchers at Stanford University and the University of Washington, &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;notes. Other examples of its videos include one which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/6/27/18760463/project-veritas-youtube-sting-james-okeefe"&gt;claimed to show evidence&lt;/a&gt; of bias against then-President Trump at Google, as well as another that claimed to show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243097/facebook-leaker-project-veritas-moderation-documents"&gt;bias against conservatives at Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dbrand starts selling matte black PS5 plates and dares Sony to sue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Soi9Lg60G3k_mf3C_GLbsXIeh8=/0x0:1536x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808286/ps5__360__01_fd79c03e79f568f3a5f1969a45374077.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BbSGoq"&gt;It’s fair to say the PlayStation 5’s huge, two-tone industrial design is not for everyone, and now Dbrand says it has a solution. The company best known for its custom phone skins and cases has &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;put “Darkplates” on sale&lt;/a&gt;, with the promise that the precisely carved slabs of plastic will turn your PS5 into a murdered-out matte-black hunk of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8hGe0"&gt;This isn’t just an unofficial accessory — Dbrand is actively encouraging Sony to sue it for putting the product out. The background there is that a small company, first called PlateStation5 then CustomizeMyPlates, was &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-faceplate-seller-is-now-cancelling-all-orders-following-legal-action-from-sony/"&gt;forced to cancel and refund orders for a similar product&lt;/a&gt; last year following legal action from Sony. Now Dbrand’s order page reads “Go ahead, sue us” at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GN2pVh"&gt;The goading doesn’t stop there. Dbrand’s Darkplate features a texture somewhat inspired by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation button icons microtexture&lt;/a&gt; found on the PS5 and its controller. The company describes it as “a familiar-but-legally-distinct apocalyptic spin on the classic PlayStation button shapes.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFTTTm0DI1gc9k5jINAW5RRezfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299537/__3_faceplates_disc.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f6lRpZ"&gt;The Darkplate also has an optional skin for the glossy black middle section of the PS5, in case you want to customize its color or just make it less of a breeding ground for fingerprints. Beyond the matte black option, there are plain yellow and white skins as well as patterns like “robot camo” and “redcode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9rSPx"&gt;Converting your PS5 to matte black won’t be particularly cheap and might not be all that  quick. One set of plates sells for $49 plus shipping, while adding a middle skin takes the base price up to $60.95. All three waves of product set to ship in February, March, and April respectively have sold out in the past couple of hours, while a fourth wave for May is now available for backorder. The PS5 Digital Edition version of the plates, meanwhile, hasn’t yet been put on sale at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley’s big local co-op update has come to consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stardew Valley" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnTR4Cq8-B_mQzU1Li5idxO8aIk=/86x0:1018x621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68807205/SDV_iPhone_10_half.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KocIhj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;’s 1.5 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193717/stardew-valley-update-pc-farming"&gt;delighted a lot of us when it came out for PC in December&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s finally arriving for consoles. The game’s developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1359988190694629376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1359988190694629376%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the update should be rolling out to Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation “within the next couple of hours.” As of this writing, it is already available on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vn8qvH"&gt;The most notable feature in the update is local, split-screen co-op play, which seems absolutely perfect for consoles. Do I want to sit next to someone I love on the couch and build a farm together? Absolutely, yes, and now we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ0s2L"&gt;The update also includes a new Advanced Options menu, new buildings, animals, and enemies, and of course a crop of bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZXm1bi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Stardew Valley 1.5 Update for Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation are out, and should be available on all platforms within the next couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1359988190694629376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr1ioi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-full-changelog/"&gt;The full changelog is available on &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;’s website&lt;/a&gt;, and you can look through it yourself to see which changes excite you— we’re hyped for chairs that you can actually sit on, a menu tab that tells you if you’ve talked to someone that in-game day, and an entirely new region with its own quest and characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykcb8d"&gt;When we first covered this update, we called &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;our “forever game,” because a lot of us keep coming back to play it every time it’s updated. Despite the game’s popularity (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-has-sold-more-than-10-million-copies/"&gt;it’s sold over 10 million copies&lt;/a&gt;), it still feels like a very personal project — just like my farm in the game, though I’ll admit that’s a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; less impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa can now greet people from your Ring Doorbell Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQfSsxf_Dx27xw_WPm7Ttly-2ho=/186x0:2028x1228/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806917/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_2.44.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell Pro can now talk to your visitors with Alexa.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSQzzs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/2021/02/10/now-your-ring-video-doorbell-answers-the-door-for-you-with-smart-responses/"&gt;Amazon is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that it’s adding Alexa to its Ring Video Doorbell Pro, giving it the ability to talk to people when they come to your house. The feature is called Alexa Greetings, and requires that you have a Ring Protect subscription, which starts at $3 a month. If you do, Alexa can ask your visitors what they want, and they can choose to leave a video recording as a message. If they’re a delivery person, Alexa will be able to tell them where to leave the packages — assuming the delivery person is willing to talk to your robotic doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xy8hFM"&gt;Beyond automating the process of taking video messages and directing deliveries, it’s unclear if Alexa will bring any additional functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6PB2H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EyzJ4wVr8JI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar9kl1"&gt;The company is also announcing a Quick Replies feature, which should work on most of its doorbells without needing that subscription (though the company’s cheapest doorbell, the $60 Ring Video Doorbell Wired, isn’t getting that feature either). The feature lets you choose a canned response such as “we can’t answer the door right now, but if you’d like to leave a message, you can do it now” or “please leave the package outside. If you’d like to leave a message, you can do it now.” Of course, there are also replies that let the person standing at your door know that you’ll be there in just a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyguRv"&gt;Lastly, Amazon is also bringing a motion warning to some of its doorbells and cameras, which will audibly tell anyone around that Ring is recording if it detects motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qvK1O"&gt;All the new features can be turned on or off in the Ring app, so if you don’t want Alexa answering the door for you, you can simply not enable the feature. Also, if we’re adding new features to the Ring doorbells, it would be great to see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227528/arlo-touchless-video-doorbell"&gt;a touchless doorbell function added&lt;/a&gt; (especially since most of these these new features require actually pressing the button).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iz6PFi"&gt;The announcements come at a time when the company is both receiving criticism for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;working with police to provide footage&lt;/a&gt; captured by Ring cameras, and attempting to increase the cameras’ appeal to privacy-centric users by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"&gt;testing end-to-end encryption support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tron invades Fortnite with Light Cycles and new skins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbp3hRkbcCqiSBruOIi25NQlt-w=/257x0:1877x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806851/Et_fq5wXMAEgyf1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xReTHl"&gt;Today Epic revealed the latest crossover for its battle royale hit, which brings the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/tron-outfits-arrive-in-fortnite"&gt;retrofuturistic world of &lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HogqRG"&gt;There are ten different &lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;-themed skins available in the in-game store right now, and each has a removable helmet. You can also get a Light Cycle glider and an Identity Disc pickaxe. It’s not yet clear whether you’ll be able to throw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CeMrLa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ3k5G"&gt;This season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been particularly busy when it comes to licensed crossovers. The season debuted with the inclusion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt;, who have since been joined by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief&lt;/a&gt;, the Predator, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;G.I. Joe’s Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also been a new skin based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics"&gt;Spanish streamer TheGrefg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;a line of soccer skins based on real-world teams&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrbs5G"&gt;Okay, screenwriters, directors, authors, and production companies — we get it. You have some experience telling stories about Wall Street, the video game industry, or social networks, and you see some &lt;em&gt;mighty&lt;/em&gt; big dollar signs in the true tale of how Reddit managed to drive an ailing video game retailer’s stocks to completely ridiculous highs through sheer power of will plus a David versus Goliath narrative that probably &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687"&gt;doesn’t hold up under close examination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgitZr"&gt;So you’re making movies — five of them&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;and two shows. Why not? It’s not like any one person has the rights to a news event like this! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B0px3"&gt;As of Thursday, February 11th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NPyjwt"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/gamestop-series-hbo-1234901914/"&gt;HBO now has a movie&lt;/a&gt; from the guy who wrote &lt;em&gt;Too Big to Fail &lt;/em&gt;and co-created Showtime’s &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L4CGtC"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261036/wallstreet-bets-movie-adaptation-deals-netflix-mgm"&gt;MGM optioned a movie&lt;/a&gt; based on a book that hasn’t even been written yet&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;whose author you’ll probably know from the book that became David Fincher’s &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7YcB5W"&gt;WallStreetBets’s founder &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-wallstreetbets-founder-sells-life-story-to-movie-producer-ratpac-entertainment-11612440001"&gt;has sold his life story to RatPac&lt;/a&gt;, a production company that worked on movies like &lt;em&gt;X-Men: First Class&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Revenant&lt;/em&gt;, before &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/news/brett-ratner-warners-cofinancing-deal-ends-1202750809/"&gt;its founder was accused of sexual misconduct in 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bmw51S"&gt;Netflix is negotiating with the screenwriter of &lt;em&gt;The Hurt Locker &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Zero Dark Thirty&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/"&gt;to write yet another movie&lt;/a&gt;, with one of those cute guys &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134580/netflix-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before-release-stream-subscriber"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; playing a role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wz146r"&gt;Netflix is &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/gamestop-docuseries-production-netflix-story-syndicate-1234906437/"&gt;working on a docu-series with Story Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, the production company behind HBO’s &lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone In The Dark&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cxRrXy"&gt;The writer and director of &lt;em&gt;Console Wars &lt;/em&gt;(a book, also a movie) &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/jonah-tulis-gamestop-documentary-submarine-1234687991/"&gt;now have a feature-length documentary&lt;/a&gt; that’s “fully financed and already in production”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IWCNng"&gt;And yes, there’s &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/pinky-promise-limited-series-to-the-moon-1234684845/"&gt;a whole TV show&lt;/a&gt;. How can this possibly turn into a TV show?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DcVG6v"&gt;No. But just in case &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, we imagine this set of completely disparate productions will need some excellent titles going forward. May we humbly suggest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="x4vgLr"&gt;GameStop: Never Stop Stopping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9Dbqnx"&gt;Uncut GMEs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EJW0P4"&gt;Meme Streets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="loazlg"&gt;Short Stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X0Y6yi"&gt;From Pre-Order to Stock Order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7RC4H0"&gt;I Have No Shares, and I Must Sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hQfsZM"&gt;Hate the Player, Not the GME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEfdMO"&gt;The Weeb of Wall Street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X6plIl"&gt;The Game is Up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z1PcBM"&gt;GameStop Won’t Stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g416y3"&gt;Diamond Hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6gkQd"&gt;Robinhood and the Men in Gamer Chairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LBHO7m"&gt;To The Moon, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and HODL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RJjNcV"&gt;This Theater Still Exists Because of This Movie’s Events (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;remember AMC&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qyXOgV"&gt;The Bankrupting of the Hedge Fund Melvin Capital by the Internet Message Board WallStreetBets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsGbDh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. The dictionary definition of the word “stonk” is “a concentrated artillery bombardment,” so if I told you there is now a stonk of GameStop movies in development, that would largely be correct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCJBk1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 11th, 6:24PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added two more projects to the list, because Hollywood doesn’t know when to hodl.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk tells Joe Rogan he wants the new Tesla Roadster to hover</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CEBcdt-l2GJvvikUQblQP9qJj_g=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806667/Roadster_Front_58.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FXDNfq"&gt;Elon Musk has said for years that he wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/16/17459224/tesla-roadster-elon-musk-spacex-falcon-copv"&gt;offer a rocket thruster package to increase the already ludicrous speed of the second-generation Tesla Roadster&lt;/a&gt;. But now he says he’s considering using the thrusters to make the Roadster hover, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcXMzW"&gt;“I want it to hover, and I was trying to figure out how to make this thing hover without, you know, killing people,” Musk told Joe Rogan in &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2aB2swgyXqbFA06AxPlFmr?si=_8doDtUvSn-kkUNFE9Kp7w&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;a new episode of of the Joe Rogan Experience released Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. “Maybe it can hover like a meter above the ground, or something like that. If you plummet it’ll blow out the suspension but you’re not gonna die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CcwtM"&gt;It’s an extraordinary idea, and one that is sure to create a headache for safety regulators if Musk actually goes through with it when the new Roadster hits the market in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOwbLP"&gt;Musk has a history of pushing boundaries with Tesla’s cars, though he seems more willing lately to make choices that could force regulators to act. The redesigned Model S sedan and Model X SUV announced last month, for instance, each feature a U-shaped yoke steering wheel that &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-s-yoke-steering-wheel-regulations-nhtsa/"&gt;was reportedly a surprise to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt;. Those new vehicles will also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256504/teslas-model-s-x-redesign-automatic-shifting-prnd-gears"&gt;automatically shift between park, reverse, neutral, and drive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdyACj"&gt;Rogan asked Musk whether the steering wheel was legal in the new interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlZAlZ"&gt;“Yeah, I mean they use a yoke in Formula One,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApqppD"&gt;“Yeah, but you’re not on the highway in a Formula One car,” Rogan responded. “I like driving like this, resting my hand on the top of the wheel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xy6XQe"&gt;“Well, Autopilot is getting good enough that you won’t need to drive most of the time,” Musk said. “I find you can rest your hand on your knee... it works great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6ZsFx"&gt;In 2013, Musk bought James Bond’s submarine car from &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who Loved Me&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/18/4853098/elon-musk-will-make-bond-submarine-car-actually-transformbale"&gt;and pledged to make it transform&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1354966674525597698"&gt;still owns the car&lt;/a&gt;, but has not responded to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1354967678058827779"&gt;repeated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1197647960898600961"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; for comment about whether he’s achieved that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop surge reportedly under federal investigation for possible manipulation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8kvcR2ycHxpOWSujM1x3bs7nXo=/0x0:2603x1735/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806542/gamestop_sean_hollister_stock_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zKkU5Z"&gt;Several US government agencies are investigating the GameStop stock brouhaha to determine whether there was market manipulation involved, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-mania-is-focus-of-federal-probes-into-possible-manipulation-11613066950"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. An enthusiastic group of day traders on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets board encouraged each other to buy the stock and created what’s known as a short squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGJnDJ"&gt;The Department of Justice and the San Francisco US attorney are seeking information about activity surrounding GameStop’s stock by brokers and users on Reddit and other social media sites. Prosecutors have subpoenaed information from brokers, including Robinhood, where much of the trading activity occurred, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="v0dnUA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Reddit vs. Wall Street: the latest in the GameStop saga","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wNYTgx"&gt;During a two-week period that started in January, GME rose by some 500 percent, hitting a high of $483 on January 28th before coming back down. The stock closed Thursday at $51.50. Regulators are likely looking into whether the Reddit activity constituted an illegal pump-and-dump scheme, where traders spread inaccurate information to artificially boost a stock’s price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfaP2M"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/01/962946809/sec-acting-chair-unpacks-the-gamestop-reddit-robinhood-wall-street-debacle"&gt;is also looking into&lt;/a&gt; whether there was manipulation and probing whether Robinhood and other brokerages that temporarily froze or otherwise restricted trading of GME were in compliance with federal regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTN78B"&gt;Robinhood is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;facing dozens of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;restricted several stocks&lt;/a&gt; popular on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, with people alleging the company sought to “manipulate the market” to help other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eLCUe"&gt;The House Financial Services Committee is holding a hearing into the GameStop drama on February 18th, where Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and Robinhood founder Vlad Tenev are &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/01/robinhood-ceo-testify-maxine-waters-464491"&gt;expected to appear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NWqzW"&gt;Robinhood did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new Gram laptops are available for purchase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three LG Gram laptops open, facing the camera in a convex semicircle. Each screen displays a space image." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2aFXC_utXKY5Eas7P7LtOs28KU=/160x0:865x470/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806349/2021_LG_gram_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iru5I6"&gt;Several of LG’s 2021 Gram laptops are now available for purchase. LG announced the new lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217915/lg-gram-17-2021-laptops-announced-specs-ces"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; but had not yet announced pricing or availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAsSxb"&gt;The models you can buy now are the Gram 14, the Gram 16, and the Gram 17. The company also has two convertible laptops — the Gram 14 2-in-1 and the Gram 16 2-in-1 — coming in mid-March. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 14-inch LG Gram 2-in-1 standing in tent mode, angled to the left. The start menu is open; a stylus appears to press one of its icons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETV6PqtFNSCIWHOSCrY20n2KTA0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22298501/14T90P_G_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 14-inch convertible is coming in mid-March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6WHbKS"&gt;The models are targeting the high-end ultraportable space, with Gram 14 configurations starting at $999. Gram 16 models start at $1,299, while the singular Gram 17 model is $1,799. This last model only comes in black, while the 16-inch and 14-inch counterparts come in white and silver as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BFRWb"&gt;Gram laptops are known for being unusually light: the Gram 17 is just 2.98 pounds, which is virtually unheard of for a 17-inch laptop. Gram models we’ve reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310392/lg-gram-17-review-display-weight-specs-price-features"&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt; have also featured excellent battery life and good, roomy displays. (All Gram models have 16:10 aspect ratios.) The new laptops all include Intel’s new 11th Gen processors and are certified through Intel’s Evo program (which means Intel thinks they’re top performers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AhIGOQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG Gram 17 review: lighter than it looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21310392/lg-gram-17-review-display-weight-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2WMVl7"&gt;You can purchase available models now on LG’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
