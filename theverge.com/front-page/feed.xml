    <title>Microsoft is releasing a translucent controller for Xbox’s 20th birthday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox wireless controller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xeNB66NfX-n0T0QcD_DWMG3LQAs=/0x0:1165x777/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964036/xbox20thbirthday.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dEtAtv"&gt;Microsoft is celebrating the 20th birthday of Xbox with a couple of new, translucent accessories, including a wireless controller and a wired gaming headset. They’ll launch on November 15th, 2021 — marking 20 years to the day — and preorders are available now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErJu9k"&gt;Starting with the controller, Microsoft says its translucent look is a callback to the see-through controllers that shipped with the original Xbox debug kits. There are splashes of the brand’s signature green on the Xbox home button, as well as around the D-pad and rear grips. Microsoft colored the components silver so they’d be easier to see through its casing. Internally, though, it’s the same model as the one that ships with the Series S and Series X consoles, with Bluetooth support for connecting to mobile devices and PCs. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-20th-Anniversary-Special-Edition%2F8R419TH0Z8NV%2F5JHM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This controller costs $69.99 to preorder through the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, though it will apparently be available at various retailers on launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yWOOC5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Connect your 20th Anniversary controller to your Xbox Series X|S and unlock an exclusive dynamic background bursting to life with glowing lines and moving sparks  ✨ &lt;a href="https://t.co/RnCpzr9rDR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RnCpzr9rDR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox (@Xbox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1446116217622695945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nemqcg"&gt;The wired Xbox stereo headset is also getting the translucent treatment, but on a smaller level. Its ear cups are see-through, with a green 20th anniversary marking on the left ear cup. There are also bright green accents on the grilles between the ear pads and cups, as well as on the microphone. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fheadsets%2F20th-anniversary-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This special-edition headset will cost $69.99&lt;/a&gt;, as well, which is $10 over the standard model’s pricing. You can read more about this model (sans the cool 20th anniversary design) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632185/microsoft-new-xbox-wired-stereo-headset-series-x-s-pc-headphones-features-price"&gt;in our previous coverage here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Department of Justice creates cryptocurrency enforcement unit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L19mS4pie_R0e0o1_pSRbOf9ZTY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963919/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtlvND"&gt;The US Department of Justice has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team"&gt;created a team&lt;/a&gt; to investigate cryptocurrency-related crime. The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) will handle investigations of “crimes committed by virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and money laundering infrastructure actors,” the agency said in a news release. Mixing and tumbling services can obscure the source of a cryptocurrency transaction, by mixing it with other funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq28nL"&gt;Cryptocurrency is “used in a wide variety of criminal activity,” including ransomware demand payments, money laundering, and for the illegal sales of drugs, weapons, and malware, the agency noted. Several high-profile ransomware cases have involved demands in cryptocurrency, including the Colonial Pipeline attack in May, where the company reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a $5 million&lt;/a&gt; ransom to DarkSide (the group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;later apologized&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences” of the hack). And the Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685930/treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-ransomware-colonial-pipeline"&gt;issued sanctions&lt;/a&gt; against a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrtycA"&gt;The DOJ says the NCET, which will provide expertise in blockchain and cryptocurrency transactions for the Justice Department and other US government agencies, will draw team members from the DOJ’s money laundering, intellectual property, and computer crimes divisions, as well as from US attorneys’ offices across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jx9PFd"&gt;The team will be under the supervision of Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. to start, but the Justice Department is seeking to hire someone who has “experience with complex criminal investigations and prosecutions, as well as the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies and the blockchain,” on a more permanent basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7DMlp"&gt;Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement that NCET would “draw on the Department’s cyber and money laundering expertise to strengthen our capacity to dismantle the financial entities that enable criminal actors to flourish— and quite frankly to profit— from abusing cryptocurrency platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsHJg8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple CarPlay could control more parts of your vehicle in the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Carplay" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y085BJ1M-tw_P0wFLkprh9syRto=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963913/1344763803.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SlP45u"&gt;Ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/4/9258013/apple-car-play-review"&gt;since it was introduced in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Apple CarPlay has represented a notable upgrade over the user interfaces most cars have by default, but many of our concerns about it, and Android Auto, come up due to their limitations.  Newer features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875604/apple-carplay-ios13-multiple-screen-no-support"&gt;dual-screen support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17913786/google-maps-waze-apple-carplay-iphone-ios-12-review"&gt;third-party apps like Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; could help, but there are still huge parts of the driving experience that exist outside of Apple’s control panel. Now, Mark Gurman reports for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/apple-s-plan-for-cars-using-iphone-to-control-a-c-seats-radio?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s “IronHeart” push envisions tying settings like climate controls, seat positioning, and even specific surround sound tweaks to your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3YqJg"&gt;This is a gap that Google has closed by cutting deals with automakers like Polestar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688309/honda-google-android-auto-assistant-driving-mode-gas"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; to use Android Automotive as the basis for their UI. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, while Apple’s plans would require carmaker participation, this isn’t a plan to provide the basis for an infotainment system like Android Automotive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hSJqwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The head of Android Auto on how Google will power the car of the near future","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196234/google-android-auto-in-car-systems-apple-carplay-interview"},{"title":"Driving the Polestar 2, the first electric car with a brain by Google","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qRrw1B"&gt;Instead, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests it could resemble Apple’s smart home push with HomeKit, with an API that devices (in this case, cars) access with varying levels of support for control and sensor communication. One interesting wrinkle is the mention that with iOS 15, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/deprecated-sirikit-intent-domains"&gt;Apple removed several API features from SiriKit,&lt;/a&gt; making its occasionally disappointing assistant less capable than before. That includes controls that could, on compatible vehicles, manage these exact settings, like seat position, climate control, or audio source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zryatg"&gt;If the plans turn into real upgrades, that could mean different cars have different levels of feature support, with some using CarPlay to customize seat position, while others might not support that but could configure the vehicle’s A/C settings based on your iPhone preferences. As the report notes, so far, there has been limited support for things like manufacturer-provided CarPlay apps that can access these deeper control settings, and only BMW supports Apple CarKey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMQj5D"&gt;So what does this mean for Apple’s not-so-secret Project Titan car program? &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the CarPlay expansions wouldn’t collect car or user data, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;whatever project Kevin Lynch is now leading&lt;/a&gt; will need to glean useful insights in another way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Announcing Springboard: The Verge’s documentary on the forgotten history of the Treo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64E5gTYOD_9PcpCWYE_Gf49CTQw=/148x0:1771x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963739/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.28.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uAR9g2"&gt;A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring tried to make the future before it was ready. In &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn talks to the visionaries at Handspring and dives into their early successes and eventual failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80clsG"&gt;It’s a half-hour-long documentary featuring the key players at Palm and Handspring: Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins, Ed Colligan, and more. It’s one of our most ambitious video projects to date, and we can’t wait to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO8iuz"&gt;Handspring may no longer be a household name, but it was briefly one of the fastest growing businesses in American history, selling Visor personal digital assistants. But the company had bigger aspirations: it saw a mobile future and took the first steps toward what would become the modern smartphone — even as it faced skepticism from the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGlhgO"&gt;The dream of the Handspring Treo turned out to be too far ahead of its time — before either the technology inside smartphones or the industry that sold them was ready for it. And a number of bad internal decisions and outside disasters would stall Handspring long enough that Apple would go on to do what Handspring couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Bphu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is also a look at an earlier time in tech — when the dot com bubble was bursting, but big tech hadn’t coalesced into five or six titanic monoliths. It was a time when many futures seemed possible, even one where a tiny startup could win the coming smartphone wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myh7cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;premieres first on Monday, October 25th, on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s new app on TV streaming devices: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Android TV (Apple TV coming soon). Look for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; app on your streaming device or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680029/the-verge-tv-app-android-tv-amazon-fire-tv-roku"&gt;learn how to download here.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlKQ7B"&gt;If you want to be the very first to see it, &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; will also be screening in New York City on Saturday, October 23rd, and we’ll do a live Q&amp;amp;A session right after. We hope you can make it! You can get &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergearticle"&gt;tickets here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s security problems started long before this week’s hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_DQs6plGSShAGtyNblXV9yjtTSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963683/acastro_190812_1777_twitch_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWsNIX"&gt;A massive security breach at Twitch has exposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;a wealth of information&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to the website’s source code, unreleased projects, and even how much the top streamers make. As data analysts and journalists work to decipher what exactly is contained in the hundreds of gigabytes of information, others are still wondering how this happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phKQLu"&gt;Such a breach seemed like it was increasingly likely to some. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has spoken to multiple sources who claim that during their time at Twitch, the company valued speed and profit over the safety of its users and security of its data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc5tHc"&gt;This data breach, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712365/twitch-data-leak-breach-security-confirmation-comments"&gt;which Twitch blames&lt;/a&gt; on an error to a server configuration, is the latest in a series of security and moderation problems that have plagued the Amazon-owned streaming platform. In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;hate raids&lt;/a&gt; in which marginalized streamers were subjected to uncontrollable numbers of bots spamming hate speech erupted across Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihL2Rq"&gt;Streamers banded together to create the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620874/twitch-implements-improved-chat-filters"&gt;#twitchdobetter hashtag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;organized a walkout&lt;/a&gt; on September 1st to bring attention to the problem and spur Twitch to deploy safety measures to stem the hate tide. In response, Twitch acknowledged streamers’ complaints, urged patience, and promised it was working on tools that would help to better protect streamers and their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OIErR"&gt;“You’re asking us to do better, and we know we need to do more to address these issues,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1425550620887375876?s=20"&gt;Twitch said in its response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5TtS01"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve seen a lot of conversation about botting, hate raids, and other forms of harassment targeting marginalized creators. You’re asking us to do better, and we know we need to do more to address these issues. That includes an open and ongoing dialogue about creator safety.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1425550620887375876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ny0mPI"&gt;But hate raids didn’t just suddenly appear this summer and, according to a former Twitch employee, alarms were raised about the potential abuses of raids long before their hate variety exploded in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uNvYd"&gt;One source, who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the condition of anonymity, worked at Twitch from 2017 to 2019. They described an atmosphere where employees were very concerned about safety but management less so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYm2it"&gt;“There would be constant questions and discontent about the regular moderation failures,” the source says, explaining that management would respond to that discontent, “very slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcYWkC"&gt;This source claims raids were internally discussed as being a vector for harassment just by virtue of their name alone and that the team had to rush to secure the feature before it went live. The source characterizes Twitch as a place foremost concerned with the bottom line. If it wasn’t generating revenue, then it wasn’t valued as highly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DvTpmyvrFRT6kY2t3Lf6aVDc3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907125/XMvqozb.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitch has reset everyone’s stream keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8wohVO"&gt;Another source tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Twitch has regularly chosen not to disclose security issues it has faced. An unreported security problem occurred in 2017, according to the source, and opened up the platform to new risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfvbTN"&gt;Scammers were allegedly able to contact streamers requesting revenue sharing from Twitch Prime subscriptions, and the source claims it led to Twitch accounts being connected to compromised Amazon accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNejSE"&gt;The source notes that attackers can now see the shortcuts and APIs for internal Amazon services thanks to this leak. Because Amazon’s Prime Gaming offers revenue to streamers through subscriptions, the source warns it could be a fresh attack vector for hackers aiming to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="gVTJCh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10794734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d8ld8A"&gt;Multiple sources describe Twitch as a company that pays “lip service” to safety, but that doesn’t back up its words with action. While Amazon owns Twitch, the streaming service was given full control over its technology stack. That’s meant Twitch uses a lot of third-party services that Amazon has traditionally avoided. Twitch was on Slack before Amazon eventually adopted it, and two sources say Twitch has struggled to perform effective audits on the software and tools it has been using in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1j580"&gt;The same source claims they were also being asked to “approve and review documents” months after they had left Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iE82G5"&gt;All of this adds up to the type of messy environment where a configuration mistake, like the one that happened this week, seemed inevitable. Twitch suffered some type of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8280193/twitch-hack-password-change"&gt;security issue in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, which led to unauthorized access on some accounts. This new breach has exposed a massive amount of internal data to the internet, leaving Twitch with no option but to address it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qCve8"&gt;Twitch is now racing to work out exactly how much data has been stolen in this hack. “As the investigation is ongoing, we are still in the process of understanding the impact in detail,” says Twitch. While Twitch investigates, hundreds or thousands of people are now tearing apart its most inner secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Alan Wake Remastered strikes a balance between new and old</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02798cPYVmbtjym5_4B0T2RTpts=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963609/Unknown.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ikAJP7"&gt;“Remaster” can be a nebulous term in video games, covering anything from direct ports on modern platforms to wholesale graphical overhauls. &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, which was released this week, lands somewhere in the middle and feels like an appropriate use of the term. The Xbox 360 action thriller from 2010 hasn’t been changed all that much, but Remedy and co-developer D3T have done enough to make it feel more at home on current hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd1ZVT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly a lost classic. The Xbox 360 version is downloadable on Xbox One and Series consoles, and the PC version on Steam holds up pretty well at higher resolutions and frame rates. That said, it never came out for PlayStation platforms, and Remedy felt there was an opportunity to bring it to fans of single-player games who hadn’t had a chance to play it before. “We wanted to bring the game to new (and old) audiences,” communications director Thomas Puha tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, noting that the company acquired the game’s publishing rights from Microsoft in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TPfVo"&gt;I’ve been playing the PlayStation 5 version of &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a subtle but improved release. The game runs at a much higher resolution than the Xbox 360 original, of course, and at 60 frames per second. There are a lot of graphical tweaks, from reworked character models to sharper textures, and the studios even had a team solely dedicated to working on the foliage and forest environments, which feel much richer in this version. The graphics still aren’t what you’d expect from a brand-new PS5 title, and the overall level design remains identical, so you can tell you’re playing a game from a couple of generations back. But that was the plan from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHiF83mxRQOTzqzogG6tTlG2R7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907050/Unknown_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X3eElh"&gt;“We wanted to do a remaster, not a remake,” says Puha. “We were pretty much aligned from the start that there wouldn’t be changes to the experience outside of the visual improvements.” Remedy did feel tempted to go back and fix certain elements of the gameplay that might not have aged so well, like the occasional pacing issues with waves of enemies, or the way Alan can only sprint for five seconds before running out of breath, but ultimately decided to preserve the way the game plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qDhBho"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You change one thing and that has a ripple effect over the whole project.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4u8CHV"&gt;“Those [elements] are part of the original experience,” Puha says. “That’s how it was then so that’s how it is going to be now. We didn’t change those things. You change one thing and that has a ripple effect over the whole project. If Alan could always sprint, then the combat changes drastically, we’d have to redesign the encounters to accommodate the change in speed and it’s a slippery slope ... soon the game is fundamentally different after a few ‘small’ tweaks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoXg0X"&gt;The one way &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; does play differently from the original, at least on the PS5, is in its use of DualSense trigger resistance and haptic feedback. It’s one of the better third-party releases I’ve found in that regard, with the controller convincingly conveying subtle actions like light footsteps as you explore. The variable trigger resistance actually improves the combat, giving you helpful feedback on whether you’re readying your flashlight or your weapon depending on how far down you press L2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVJJDZOgdH-thjwW3pydY5UyZE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907051/Unknown_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wf8JgO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; went through a famously lengthy development cycle of more than five years; the game was announced before the Xbox 360 even hit the market, which made me wonder if there might have been any lingering complexities in bringing it to modern hardware. “There are always legacy issues and plenty of bugs under the hood that never get fixed in every video game,” Puha says. “The codebase of the original &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; was in pretty good shape considering the protracted development, but it took many months for D3T to study and research at the original codebase and gain an understanding how Remedy’s old engine works, all the various things we did in some special way … so you have to do quite a bit of learning and research, before you can actually start building and improving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meSFTF"&gt;As for those improvements, D3T had its work cut out. Technical director Andy Booth says that the majority of assets in &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; had to be built from scratch, giving the example of elements like rivets and handles that are now fully modeled in 3D as opposed to being part of a texture. However, the team always used the original assets as the basis of their rendering, and in some cases they were able to use existing textures that had been preserved in a higher resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rW15k"&gt;“The general rule for the art team was to always utilize as much of the original art as possible, so that we could preserve the original creative intent,” Booth tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we did have to remake something, it was regularly compared against the original as part of the review process. This was a fine line to walk, as it needed to be, at a macro level, the same visual look as the original, but also be of a higher fidelity to look good on 4K screens.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v4m1DupEnr7d5aoouMfNTk-o1UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907052/Unknown_3.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqqahf"&gt;A major focus for the remaster was improving the cinematic sequences. “They weren’t great in the original game,” says Puha, “But they were the most complicated and time-consuming to upgrade without redoing them entirely, which would have been too costly, time-consuming, and impossible in the confines of the project.” Booth explains that the new cutscenes combine original animations with new motion capture and 3D models because these elements all still have to interact with the rest of the existing scene. One consequence of this is that the cutscenes run at 30fps, unlike the rest of the game, though Booth says this is “for both technical and cinematic reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ySuyxH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A fine line to walk.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UmbTwI"&gt;Puha says Remedy has no plans to remove the original version of &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; from the storefronts on which it exists. All the same, I think anyone checking out the game for the first time would be better off with the remaster unless they have the PC version sitting in their Steam backlog. &lt;em&gt;Remastered&lt;/em&gt; preserves &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt;’s mysterious, occasionally clunky appeal, but generally runs well and feels at home on a PS5 DualSense controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRE2qU"&gt;And now is a good time to get on board, following some teases in Remedy’s previous big game &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, because more &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; is likely on the way. When Remedy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside"&gt;struck a publishing deal with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; early last year it said there would be a major new project coming as well as a “smaller-scale project set in the same franchise” — and the studio has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; is indeed that latter game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfkK8P"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Alan Wake Remastered &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now for PlayStation, Xbox, and on the Epic Games Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s harder to resist Apple’s AirPods when they’re just $109</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person wearing Apple AirPods" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAi-KUqQWuuASI-9Cc2LFq0Sj1E=/0x1:1199x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963594/airpodsmodel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Ph47e"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are no stranger to a decent deal, but they’re selling for close to their lowest price yet at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2MtVoExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2MtVoExnTVM0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. You can pick up the set that includes a wired charging case for $109 (originally $159). These don’t have the same great sound quality or active noise cancellation found in the more costly AirPods Pro. Still, the standard AirPods might surprise you. I picked up a set a few months ago after being a holdout, and they sound good enough for casual listening, but the best feature to me is their fast and strong wireless connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t7daTP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjfTaa"&gt;The set of AirPods that includes a wireless charging case for Qi chargers, but is otherwise the same as the set above, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to $129 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (originally $199).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rDnK31"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1bUsQD"&gt;Alternatively, if you want wireless earbuds from Apple’s Beats that have better sound quality, active noise cancellation, and USB-C charging (making them just as handy for Android as they are for iOS), consider the Beats Studio Buds. Normally $150, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re $125 at Amazon in a few colors&lt;/a&gt;. These also include a wired charging case, but the similarities with the AirPods above stop there. The Studio Buds include three sizes of ear tips so you can find the right fit for your ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fJ7MNC"&gt;If you’re looking for voice control of smart home devices and prefer the Google Assistant over Amazon Alexa or Apple’s Siri, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1505874-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00781_us_home_mini_charcoal_2nd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22713078%2Fapple-airpods-beats-google-nest-mini-gigabyte-gaming-laptop-zelda-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJA2aQnTKB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have the best deal right now on the second-generation Nest Mini. The tiny smart speaker is 50 percent off at both retailers, dropping to just $25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpEXii"&gt;The Nest Mini doesn’t compete with Google’s own Nest Audio for sound quality, but generation to generation, its audio quality improvements are most noticeable when you mount it to a wall. Also, the fabric covering and color options ensure they should complement your home decor with a touch of style. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ak0qZy"&gt;The latest and greatest streaming box from Apple brings plenty to the table with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, 4K HDR, and support for Apple services like Apple TV Plus and Fitness Plus, but you might just love it because they finally improved the remote. Gone is the frustrating trackpad-focused remote of the prior model, now replaced with sizable physical buttons. If you own a previous Apple TV box, the speed improvements here should make upgrading worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNZNMD"&gt;While you can get a nice $169 price &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFXH02LL%2FA%2Frefurbished-apple-tv-4k-64gb-2nd-generation%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C482924%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;subid1=vergedeals100621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Apple on a refurbished model&lt;/a&gt;, the best deal on a new in-box version of the Apple TV 4K is at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmxgy2lla.html%3Femailprice%3Dt&amp;amp;subid1=vergedeals100621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama for $159&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The new Moto G Pure is a $159.99 4G phone with a MediaTek chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQFr149R1ALHaMj-uBuZw-WzQLU=/0x71:3508x2410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963420/moto_g_pure_key_visual_horizontal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure (2021) is a 4G phone that shares many of the same specs as the Moto G Play, but is $10 cheaper.&lt;/em&gt; | Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3mI5W"&gt;Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Motorola is squeezing in one more budget-friendly phone into its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;2021 Moto G lineup&lt;/a&gt; — the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1SsMd"&gt;At $159.99, the Moto G Pure is the least expensive member of Motorola’s lineup, with the already-released Moto G Play only costing about $10 more at $169 (before discounts). Both the Moto G Power and the G Stylus, on the other hand, cost significantly more at $199 and $299, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aWltE"&gt;The biggest difference between the Moto G Pure and the G Play is in their processors. The G Pure uses the MediaTek Helio G25, while the G Play uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chip from 2020. Based on processor comparison data from &lt;a href="http://Nanoreview.net"&gt;Nanoreview.net&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapdragon 460 is the faster and more energy-efficient octa-core processor of the two. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;our review of the Qualcomm-powered Moto G Play&lt;/a&gt; already noted how under-powered that phone felt, so keep your expectations low for the MediaTek chip’s performance on the Moto G Pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kchl5"&gt;Like its more expensive sibling, the Moto G Pure also has 3GB RAM to support its processor, 32GB of internal storage that is expandable with a microSD card, and a 6.5-inch display at 720p that is a bit low-resolution for 2021. Other features that are unique to the G Pure: it is water repellent against light rain (IP52) and has a 4000mAh battery that Motorola claims can last up to two days, depending on use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMjnMKFDa1Iz8O2aVFG1g5Uj8gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22904847/moto_g_pure_deep_indigo_combo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure is water repellent (IP52), has an audio jack, as well as a radio antenna.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EyntJS"&gt;The G Pure’s camera system is similar to the G Play’s, but its 13-megapixel main camera has a slightly smaller f/2.2 aperture. There’s also a 2-megapixel depth sensor and a 5-megapixel front camera. Since Motorola is known for its fun photo software and smart AI, you can experiment with photography features like Spot Color, Auto Smile Capture, and Smart Compose on this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzYygv"&gt;The Moto G Pure is compatible with all the North American 4G LTE bands — from Verizon to Telus, but it doesn’t support any 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rK2ZN2"&gt;If you want to get your hands on this Moto G Pure as soon as possible, you’ll need to pre-order the unlocked version on October 14th, which retails for $159.99. It’ll be available from Best Buy, Walmart, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Amazon and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FMotorola.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22709569%2Fmotorola-moto-g-pure-mediatek-4g-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Motorola.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9PgEp"&gt;If you’re looking for carrier deals, Verizon will be offering this phone for “free” when you sign up for a new line with a 24–30-month payment plan (for $149.99 in value), starting October 14th. Metro by T-Mobile will also be offering a similar deal in the near future, but no timeline has been shared. Otherwise, you’ll need to hang tight for this phone to land in other carriers in both countries — within the next few months, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Go 3 review: left behind</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The tradeoffs aren’t worth it anymore&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fnJwjb"&gt;From what I can tell, Microsoft intends the Surface Go 3 to be sold to two kinds of customers: kids and IT professionals who need a tiny computer when they’re out in the field. I’m in the third category of potential customers: people who love tiny computers. For all three groups, the Surface Go 3 is a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKSISD"&gt;The Surface Go 3 is Microsoft’s smaller-sized Surface tablet. It has a 10.5-inch screen and one fewer port than its larger Pro sibling, but otherwise looks very much the same. That means it offers the same excellent build quality and overall premium design as full-sized Surface tablets. It is a great-looking device that’s often a pleasure to use — so long as you don’t use it to do too much or need it to last very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rWMkMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro 8 review: the best of both worlds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"},{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ELh3V1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10794418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xid7aw"&gt;Once upon a time, if you could only spend a limited amount of money on a computer, you had to accept that it would be slow. Those times are behind us: you can get a Chromebook, an iPad, and even some Windows laptops for under $500 that will run circles around the Surface Go 3, even the higher-spec model that I’m testing with a Core i3 processor that costs $759.98 with the fancier Alcantara Type Cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Pydw2"&gt;The Go 3 starts at $399.99 with a Y-series processor and a paltry 64GB of slower eMMC storage and 4GB of RAM. I can’t imagine anybody using that edition for anything more than light web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Go 3 looks just like a tiny Surface Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eNuDizdu8B0rm7vCqr7Pp1U4_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892211/vpavic_210930_4784_0028_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Go 3 looks just like a tiny Surface Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It works with Surface Pens, but doesn’t support the haptics on the newer pen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T96SRgguUiRzqavdmlo8Q08ZTc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892219/vpavic_210930_4784_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It works with Surface Pens but not haptics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrarTl"&gt;I’ve always said the Surface Go is a fine little computer if you understand its limitations and are willing to work within them. But by the third generation, you’d think Microsoft would have found a way to either remove more of those limits or provide better tradeoffs for them. Unfortunately, neither of those things have happened this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eddVqV"&gt;The long and (especially) short of this review is simply this: four and a half hours. That’s the longest I was able to keep the Surface Go 3 running in active use. One of the apps I was running was power hungry (that’d be Slack), but the only other app was the Edge browser with somewhere around a dozen tabs. That’s it. When I took the Go 3 outside and needed to crank the brightness up, that battery life dropped to three. I’m not sure where Microsoft gets its 11-hour estimate, but it’s far from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVN2XM"&gt;If the battery life were better, my old advice about working within this computer’s limitations would still apply. It has Windows 11 by default — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;read Tom Warren’s full review here&lt;/a&gt; — and though the edges are rough, the interface overall feels really nice and usable on this smaller, 10.5-inch touchscreen. Snap Assist for tiling windows is especially useful with this smaller screen, since it’s harder to get windows to the arrangement I’m used to on bigger displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9kYF0"&gt;Windows 11 has an advantage over iPadOS in that it actually supports multiple users. And compared to ChromeOS, it can run many more useful apps (though not yet Android apps). But it’s possible to get all those Windows benefits without making all the compromises the Go 3 demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows 11 works nicely on the Go 3, albeit not quickly." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZM393CtPANRxBK8TApD_TjnNcMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892215/vpavic_210930_4784_0054.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 works nicely on the Go 3, albeit not quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard cover isn’t sturdy enough." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wmX4kKzxK8F_ymO2REGNqWiaVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892210/vpavic_210930_4784_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard cover isn’t sturdy enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo86RS"&gt;The overall physical design is unchanged — a bummer since the Surface Pro 8 got such a big update this year. It still works with the older Surface Pen design if you have one of those, but it doesn’t support haptics from the newer pen. The Type Cover still has a nice keyboard but a flimsy keyboard deck. It’s so flimsy that I often accidentally click the mouse simply by resting my hands on the palm rests when it’s on my lap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toYwTr"&gt;Perhaps the most baffling part of the Surface Go 3 is that it isn’t using an Arm-based processor, like the Surface Pro X. If it did, I have to imagine it would get the benefits of longer battery life without taking too much of a speed hit (even the Core i3 version can’t be described as “fast”). Perhaps those aforementioned IT pros wouldn’t be able to run the apps they need on Arm — or perhaps Microsoft simply didn’t want to spend the R&amp;amp;D budget necessary to redesign the Surface Go 3 around a new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A tiny computer that’s still easy to love, but hard to use." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6xWDV6M5K452V29Q9JYtbAQQy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892218/vpavic_210930_4784_0069.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny computer that’s still easy to love but hard to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JbHNDR"&gt;Last year, I said the Surface Go 2 was easy to love and hard to live with. And despite everything, there are times I really do love using the Surface Go 3. There is something wonderful about having such a tiny, light device that theoretically can do anything a bigger Windows computer can do — albeit more slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwFiPb"&gt;Unless having a tiny Windows tablet is an absolute necessity, there are better options. If you don’t need Windows, ChromeOS and iPad devices can be this small and last longer on a charge. If you do need Windows, there are plenty of computers that are just slightly larger but offer way better value. In fact, at this price I’d recommend tracking down a used or refurbished Surface Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EqLsUA"&gt;The Surface Go 3 is always a joy to carry and often a joy to use, but I wish I could use it for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="28o5Hw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790097"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
