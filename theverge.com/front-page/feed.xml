    <title>Halide’s latest update brings the iPhone 13 Pro’s Macro Mode to older iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzUynfgZ0Yy2u-5dFqIZcRbXLGk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959756/macro_mode_halide.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Halide&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFyEUx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide/id885697368"&gt;Halide&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best photography apps on the iPhone, and the company has just updated its app with a new macro feature, designed to perfectly complement the new macro mode that Apple added with this year’s iPhone 13 Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlozy"&gt;But Halide’s 2.5 update doesn’t just add support for the iPhone 13 Pro’s existing macro feature that Apple made. It takes things a step further and adds a macro mode for older iPhones, too, using Apple’s Neural Engine for “AI-based detail enhancement,” which uses a neural network to squeeze extra detail out of the close-up shot, even when you crop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iK9cub"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10792972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iAwKxX"&gt;The “official” macro mode on the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max uses the new ultra-wide lens that Apple offers on its more premium models, which — unlike the ultra-wide on the regular iPhone 13 models or older iPhones — add an auto-focus mode that makes the ultra-close up photography possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBeYID"&gt;Halide is mimicking that effect in two ways: first, it determines what camera lens on your device can focus the closest, and then the app offers “sub-millimeter” focus control to get the perfect shot. Then, it uses the aforementioned “Neural Macro” feature to upscale the image, allowing for sharp photos even when cropped in by 2x or 3x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3O4TRY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not quite as good as the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s a fun tool to try&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LgNRc"&gt;To use Macro Mode in Halide, you’ll first need to update your version of the app to Halide 2.5 from the App Store. Then, tap the “AF” button to toggle off autofocus, which brings up the manual focus menu, where you’ll be able to tap a new flower icon to enable Macro Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npllIL"&gt;I was able to briefly test out a beta of the new update on my iPhone 12 Pro, and the results are pretty impressive. It’s still not quite on the level of the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro capabilities — there are still limits to what the older hardware is physically capable of doing — but it’s certainly a better solution than simply holding your phone close to your subject and hoping for the best and a fun tool to play around with. And while I don’t have an iPhone 13 Pro handy to test with further, Halide says that its Macro Mode enhances that feature for even better macro shots, too. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9MbsQ"&gt;The new Macro Mode addition works on any iPhone that offers Apple’s Neural Engine (which includes the iPhone 8 and all subsequent releases) and is a free update for Halide owners. Halide itself can be downloaded for free from the App Store with a seven-day free trial and can be purchased for either $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year subscriptions or a flat $ 49.99-lifetime price upfront. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chevy Silverado EV will debut at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logos Of The World" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bwf2pKDr7Y3xdU-parpv9klQcJU=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959711/1188353086.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JJQY37"&gt;General Motors will debut the all-electric Chevy Silverado at the 2022 Consumer Electronics show in January in Las Vegas, Nevada, as part of CEO Mary Barra’s opening keynote address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1ugbo"&gt;The Silverado EV will be the second electric truck announced by GM, following the pickup version of the resurrected Hummer. The Silverado is one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s much larger push into electric vehicles — an effort that GM described in greater detail on Wednesday during an investor event where it also announced a new version of its hands-free driver assistance system. It will be the first electric truck for the Chevy brand, though, and it’s sort of fitting that it will debut at CES, considering that the production Bolt EV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10725182/chevrolet-bolt-electric-car-ces-2016"&gt;revealed there in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wq0P6VbN7_l3wMrgPoOnTg83EOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905221/GlassRoof.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bn78m"&gt;The Silverado EV will be built on the same Ultium battery pack and electric drivetrain that GM is using to power the Hummer, the Cadillac Lyriq, and multiple other vehicles. The company claims that will let the electric Silverado travel more than 400 miles on a full charge. It will be sold in both consumer and fleet versions, much like the Ford F-150 Lightning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srxw5H"&gt;GM announced Wednesday that all-wheel steering will be an option for the Silverado EV, as well as a “fixed-glass roof,” which it teased in a photo. While it’s not as expansive as the all-glass roof on Tesla’s cars, or Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, it’s much bigger than a typical moonroof and hopefully won’t give GM some of the same adhesion problems that those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696482/ford-mustang-mach-e-glass-windshield-recall-roof"&gt;other companies have dealt with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y871J2"&gt;Otherwise, not too much is known about Chevy’s first mass-market electric truck, including when it will be on the market. GM has already made some big promises around its Ultium generation of electric vehicles, even while it struggles with its first generation thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677539/chevy-bolt-recall-gm-electric-vehicles-fire-tesla-competition"&gt;massive recall of the Bolt EV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM reveals Ultra Cruise ‘hands-free’ system that covers ‘95 percent’ of driving scenarios </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6W9iDW6po08Oxe_QtVhiPkcVM9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959707/acastro_200406_1777_gm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q6pXoZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750833/gm-ultra-cruise-super-cruise-adas-autonomous-tech"&gt;After years of teases&lt;/a&gt;, General Motors is finally pulling the curtain back on its next-generation “hands-free” driver-assist technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B97z3d"&gt;Dubbed Ultra Cruise, the new system uses sensors like cameras, radars, and lidar to control the steering, acceleration, and braking on 2 million miles of paved roads and in “95 percent” of driving scenarios, the automaker says. Ultra Cruise will be available in a handful of premium model vehicles in 2023, though GM wouldn’t disclose which models will receive the new active driver-assist system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0liLyf"&gt;The news was announced as part of GM’s two-day annual investor event, in which GM also announced news about its plan to double revenues by 2030 as it seeks to become a software company in addition to making cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U89XYL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Cruise will be available in a handful of premium model vehicles in 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7DBDx"&gt;GM’s first-generation advanced driver-assist system (ADAS), Super Cruise, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/cadillac-super-cruise-outperforms-other-active-driving-assistance-systems/"&gt;has been praised&lt;/a&gt; as a safer, more capable version of Tesla’s Autopilot, thanks to its camera-based driver monitoring system that ensures drivers keep their eyes on the road. GM says Super Cruise will “co-exist” with Ultra Cruise, with the former available in more “mainstream” vehicles, while the latter is reserved for GM’s luxury models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kulbit"&gt;Super Cruise, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/10/15224516/cadillac-super-cruise-hands-free-ct6-tesla-autopilot"&gt;debuted in 2017 in the Cadillac CT6 sedan&lt;/a&gt;, is capable of completely hands-free driving across more than 200,000 miles of divided highway across North America. It compares the vehicle’s position, taken from both GPS and onboard cameras, to its location in a lidar scan of the world. Once the vehicle knows where it is and that it’s safe to activate, Super Cruise will take over both steering and acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="maWJeD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"GM’s Super Cruise getting fully automatic, hands-free lane changes and more for 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589285/gm-super-cruise-automatic-lane-change-gmc-chevy-silverado"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uDHhjm"&gt;By comparison, Ultra Cruise will be much more capable. GM said the system will cover “more than” 2 million miles of paved roads in the US and Canada at launch, with the capacity to grow up to more than 3.4 million miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mqhnnq"&gt;In a call with reporters, GM President Mark Reuss said Ultra Cruise would be able to handle “urban and rural” roads, in addition to stop signs, traffic signals, and other complexities that Super Cruise is currently unable to detect. “Ultra Cruise will do this in a slower environment, urban life as well,” Reuss said. “And again, we’ll have the maps out there to do over 2 million miles, moving to three and a half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FlOduf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite its enhanced capabilities, GM says it still considers Ultra Cruise a Level 2 system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCVCEI"&gt;Jason Ditman, chief engineer at GM, elaborated on Ultra Cruise’s capabilities. “Drivers will be able to travel hands-free across nearly every paved road, including city streets, subdivision streets, and rural paved roads,” Ditman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAhEEs"&gt;Ditman described Ultra Cruise as a “route following feature” that maintains headways and follows the speed limit. Ultra Cruise will also support automatic and on-demand lane changes, left and right hand turns, it will avoid close objects, and enable parking in residential driveways. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBeLe8SuCccIyOWuvVQOlw8Bm8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8301347/Cadillac_Super_Cruise_Hero_Shot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cadillac&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;GM’s Super Cruise was first rolled out in 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3EVUIV"&gt;Ultra Cruise-enabled vehicles will come equipped with lidar, which is rare for production vehicles thanks to the high costs associated with the laser sensor. “The sensing architecture is all new,” Ditman said. “There are additional cameras and radars and we are adding lidar to the vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp2MTV"&gt;Ultra Cruise won’t be able to handle every driving scenario. Ditman gave the example of a roundabout as a type of complex road condition that the ADAS will not be able to navigate. A light bar in the steering wheel will communicate to the driver when they need to control, sending signals through escalating lights and haptic feedback. A voice assistant will also inform the driver when they need to take the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEs670"&gt;GM relied on lidar-scanned high-definition maps for Super Cruise, but Ditman said it wasn’t practical to map all 2 million miles of road for Ultra Cruise. “We do rely on similar map data,” he said. “However, we have a larger number of sensors that also observe the roads so when we combine the map accuracy with what our sensors see of the road geometry and the road markings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8EHp8I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Cruise won’t be able to handle every driving scenario&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsKpjk"&gt;Despite its enhanced capabilities, GM says it still considers Ultra Cruise a Level 2 system, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. At Level 2, the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration and deceleration, as well as monitor blind spots and even change lanes automatically. But it falls short of full autonomy because a human sits in the driver’s seat and can take control of the car at any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izXpaQ"&gt;Level 2 systems aren’t infallible. Notably, Alphabet’s Waymo abandoned its plans to develop a Level 2 ADAS after determining that a fully autonomous system would be far safer. And certain automakers’ advanced driver-assistance systems often fail when driving into sharper curves, &lt;a href="https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2021/07/06/iihs-adaptive-cruise-control-level-2-pilot-assist-adas-often-inactive-on-sharp-curves/"&gt;according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaGVQF"&gt;The federal government is paying more attention to ADAS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555666/nhtsa-autonomous-vehicle-crash-report-data"&gt;recently announcing&lt;/a&gt; that automakers would be required to report incidents involving driver assistance and autonomous systems within one day of learning of a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVsO0B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Recycled plastic won’t solve tech’s waste problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-PANAMA-ENVIRONMENT-CORAL-REEFS-RESTORATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yCSBPB5DFn_KfvHpFkqRXLKetYA=/4x0:3996x2661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959614/1232418314.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A man collects garbage, including plastic waste, at the beach of Costa del Este, in Panama City, on April 19, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by LUIS ACOSTA/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t get at the root of the problem&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QgtV9B"&gt;Buying a gadget made with recycled plastic instead of brand-new materials might sound like an environmentally friendly investment, but it does very little to cut down on the heaps of plastic pollution and electronic waste that are trashing the environment and ending up everywhere — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689941/babies-infants-poop-microplastics"&gt;in our own bodies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMCt2c"&gt;Think of plastic pollution like an overflowing tub in your bathroom, says Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland who maps the international movement of electronic waste. “If you walked into that, probably the first thing you would do would be to turn off the tap — not grab a bucket and a mop, if you think of the bucket and the mop as recycling,” Lepawsky says. Turning off the tap equates to staunching the production of plastic goods. Trying to clean up a growing mess won’t address the root of the problem. “It doesn’t mean, don’t use a bucket and a mop. But that’s not turning off the tap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uQyxz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cutting down waste means cutting down consumption&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DICqxz"&gt;Cutting down waste means cutting down consumption. That’s something that can’t be solved with flashy new product offerings, even if those products are made with recycled materials. Companies need to sell fewer products that last longer so that gadgets aren’t so disposable in the first place. Hyping up recycling can actually stand in the way of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udR4SK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oceans of plastic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Holc0X"&gt;The scale of the plastics problem is massive. As of 2017, humans had produced 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic (for comparison, a rhinoceros weighs about 1 metric ton) — much of which can persist in the environment or in landfills for hundreds of years. Recycling has done little to stop that mess. Only 9 percent of plastic waste has ever been recycled, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found. People send at least &lt;a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/marine-plastics#:~:text=variety%20of%20applications.-,At%20least%208%20million%20tons%20of%20plastic%20end%20up%20in,causes%20severe%20injuries%20and%20deaths."&gt;8 million tons of plastic&lt;/a&gt; into the ocean every year, where it might end up in giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18175940/ocean-cleanup-breaks-plastic-pollution-silicon-valley-boyan-slat-wilson"&gt;garbage patches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15358950/plastics-arctic-ocean-microplastics-polar-ice-caps-birds-animals"&gt;arctic ice&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;bellies of sea life&lt;/a&gt;, and back inside our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689941/babies-infants-poop-microplastics"&gt;bodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0VAok"&gt;“We can’t recycle our way out of this problem—acute reduction of plastic products, recycled or not, is the solution,” Max Liboiron, an associate professor of geography at Memorial University who researches plastic pollution, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “​​Even the production of new plastic items that use some of these ocean plastics as feedstock will result in a net increase in plastic pollution.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e0txlz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can’t recycle our way out of this problem.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqO5rb"&gt;Take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684591/microsoft-ocean-plastic-mouse-recycled-sustainability"&gt;Microsoft’s new “Ocean Plastic Mouse,”&lt;/a&gt; which has a shell made with 20 percent recycled plastic. Any potential environmental gains that might come with that 20 percent recycled material could potentially be wiped out if the company sells 20 percent more mice, says Lepawsky. It’s a pitfall ecological economists describe as the “rebound effect” or “Jevon’s paradox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T52Bhh"&gt;To have the most impact, products should be made with 100 percent recycled materials. But that’s nearly impossible with plastic, which is why it’s pretty typical for companies to only use a small percentage of rehashed plastic in their products. Plastic quality deteriorates with each use. Because of that, it’s difficult to make a new bottle out of an old bottle or a new mouse out of an old mouse. Microsoft’s mouse, for example, required the company to create a new plastic resin that’s only partly reclaimed plastic and combines those beads of recycled plastic with new plastic, too. When all’s said and done, it’s more likely that a product will be downcycled rather than recycled. That means it’s used to make something that doesn’t require high-quality plastic. Plastic bottles, for instance, are often turned into thin fibers used in carpeting and fleece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kLvg6H"&gt;Even using 30 or 40 percent dirty plastic in the mouse probably wouldn’t be feasible, according to Claire Barlow, deputy head of the engineering department at the University of Cambridge who specializes in materials engineering and industrial sustainability. The quality of the dirty plastic just isn’t good enough, she says. It might not have the strength or durability required for the product, or it could just be too difficult to process. So the fresh plastics are used to make up the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgwqSX"&gt;All those weaknesses with plastic also make it more difficult to recycle something that’s already been made with recycled materials. There comes a point when plastic can’t even be downcycled anymore. When it reaches that point, it’s typically incinerated or sent to landfills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfsbg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plastic greenwashing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuRlE"&gt;Microsoft is far from alone when it comes to making new environmental claims with recycled materials. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538297/logitech-ergo-m575-price-release-date-news-features-trackball-mouse-bluetooth"&gt;Logitech&lt;/a&gt; has made a big push to sell items with post-consumer recycled plastic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666328/samsung-eco-friendly-sustainable-limited-edition-galaxy-watch-4-bands"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; is even making watch bands with “recyclable” and supposedly eco-friendly materials, including apple peel. The trend also extends far outside of tech to food packaging, fashion, and even toys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2VVZ6"&gt;Several factors could be driving that trend. The sheer magnitude of the plastics problem has brought it to more consumers’ attention. Plastics, which are made from fossil fuels, are also tied to another environmental crisis that’s come to the forefront more lately: climate change. Recent &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/two-thirds-of-north-americans-prefer-eco-friendly-brands-study-finds-51578661728"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that shoppers are thinking more about the sustainability of the brands they buy. Tech companies have come under a lot of pressure lately for the harm they do to the environment — particularly when it comes to their air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and water use. Employees at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874081/microsoft-employees-climate-change-letter-protest"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701431/amazon-climate-labor-activist-fired-settlement"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948057/google-workers-climate-change-demands-letter-greenhouse-gas-fossil-fuels"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and other tech giants have published letters pushing their companies to stop polluting and to stop working with fossil fuel companies altogether. While companies have announced smaller steps like using more recycled materials or fully offsetting their emissions — they haven’t agreed to meeting their employees’ more ambitious demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="42ZUut"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Without turning off the tap for plastics waste, smaller actions could amount to mere greenwashing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fQQ0FF"&gt;Without turning off the tap for plastics waste, smaller actions could amount to mere greenwashing — a term used to describe efforts to make something (like a brand) seem more eco-friendly than it really is while glossing over the real environmental harm for which it’s responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV36DP"&gt;One example of greenwashing, according to Cambridge’s Barlow, is the emergency of bio-sourced plastics that can be just as bad or even worse than traditional plastics. A majority of bio-sourced plastics, made with things like corn instead of oil, still aren’t biodegradable, she says. And raising the crops those materials are derived from might actually lead to more water use and greenhouse gas emissions than traditional plastics. “There’s a big question mark on those. When you probe, sometimes it’s fine, but most of them, it’s greenwash,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHp9Aw"&gt;Vague terms like “recyclable” also raise red flags for experts with whom &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210322005565/en/Razer-Commits-to-a-Greener-More-Sustainable-Future-for-All-to-Game-In"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; announced a goal earlier this year to make all of its products with recycled or recyclable materials by 2025. But a lot of things might be recyclable in theory but not in practice — like Amazon’s plastic shipping envelopes. Most municipal recycling programs won’t actually accept them, so consumers need to take the packaging to drop-off points for it to be recycled. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana"&gt;Few people actually do that&lt;/a&gt;, according to at least one survey by ocean advocacy group Oceana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9t8Nt"&gt;Meaningful action on the plastics problem will require much bigger changes. When companies try to tackle huge problems like climate change and plastic pollution with small announcements about recycling and changes to individual devices, Lepawski says, “It’s nibbling around the edges, dealing with symptoms and not systems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkrFPq"&gt;The Product Stewardship Institute and other environmental advocates are pushing for &lt;a href="https://www.waste360.com/generators/19-states-most-producer-responsibility-laws"&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; that would force companies to take greater responsibility for what happens to the devices they sell after customers are done with them. Companies would be required to take back items or shoulder the costs associated with responsibly disposing of them. In the absence of those policies, municipalities and taxpayers wind up carrying the financial burden — or the environment pays the ultimate cost if that’s where trash winds up. Municipal recycling programs are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219042/online-shopping-ecommerce-packaging-cardboard-boxes-recycling"&gt;recovering&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fenvironment%2Farticle%2Fchina-ban-plastic-trash-imports-shifts-waste-crisis-southeast-asia-malaysia&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22712435%2Frecycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;global shock in 2018&lt;/a&gt; when China stopped accepting most recyclable goods. With no one to sell dirty plastics to, some curbside recycling programs in the US shuttered or started sending more materials to landfills and incinerators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ocean Plastic Mouse and recycled plastic pellets" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Jh0CMovLcXKCEjnIuAQOK_0vPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869949/Ocean_Plastic_Mouse___Material_800h.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ocean Plastic Mouse and recycled plastic pellets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llFu0P"&gt;Still, experts worry that a hot market for recycled materials could keep the incentives and infrastructure in place for producing more plastics — whether they be recycled or not. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.sabic.com/en/news/30776-sabic-and-microsoft-collaborate-to-create-microsoft-s-first-product-made-with-recycled-ocean-plastic"&gt;partnered with Saudi Basic Industries Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (SABIC),&lt;a href="https://www.aramco.com/en/news-media/news/2019/aramco-sabic"&gt; a subsidiary of oil company Saudi Aramco&lt;/a&gt;, for its Ocean Plastic Mouse. Big Oil has tried to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21419505/oil-gas-price-plastics-peak-climate-change"&gt;push its plastics business&lt;/a&gt; as a growing line of revenue as efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cut into its fuel business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3Uq5e"&gt;Microsoft’s new webpage for the Ocean Plastic Mouse tells consumers that they can recycle their old mouse by mailing it into Microsoft — although there’s a disclaimer at the bottom that says its recycling program is only available in certain countries. Consumers concerned about the environment would be better off keeping their old mouse rather than recycling it and buying a new one, says Sydney Harris, policy and programs manager at the Product Stewardship Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xm6RWZ"&gt;“They’re creating new demand for a flashy new product that I don’t need because I have a perfectly functioning mouse right now,” says Harris. “That is not sustainable, inherently. I should be holding on to my mouse until it’s on its very last legs and stops working.” But even that can be hard to do when companies continually release new devices that might be incompatible with old accessories — like new laptops or phones with missing headphone jacks and different designs for chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wld8SM"&gt;When tech companies design things that quickly become obsolete, they drive another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309776/record-amount-ewaste-2019-global-report-environment-health"&gt;growing disaster&lt;/a&gt;: e-waste. E-waste contains materials beyond plastic like mercury and lead that can be toxic to people and the environment. Affluent countries like the US send much of their e-waste abroad, where it often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20992240/e-waste-recycling-electronic-basel-convention-crime-total-reclaim-fraud"&gt;winds up in makeshift recycling facilities&lt;/a&gt; that can put workers’ health at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T3nf0x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s actually very useful to brands to keep the attention downstream.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TZSHGM"&gt;The focus on post-consumer recycling ultimately shifts responsibility from companies to their customers. That will never lead to the type of deep, systemic change needed to stem the world’s waste problems, says Lepawsky. “Individual consumer action will never match the scale of the problem,” he says. Typically across industries, he says, there’s way more waste generated during the manufacturing process — before a product ever gets to market — than trash that consumers throw out. “It’s actually very useful to brands to keep the attention downstream on post consumer waste, because then it means the regulatory eye is kept off of their manufacturing process.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DV0Csd"&gt;There’s a lot of other things that big tech companies might also want to hide from prying regulatory eyes — from privacy and moderation concerns to employees coming forward about prejudice and abuse. But, hey, at least they can say they recycled something, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjICRy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is allegedly One America News Network’s biggest backer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AT&amp;amp;amp;T stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/od8RG6vHQW9OS-iuAuaDseTo7qA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959565/att1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bL5ogY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T allegedly played a pivotal role in the creation of One America News Network (OAN), a right-wing outlet frequently criticized for spreading false news stories, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att/"&gt;according to a &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. Based on court documents and other sources, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; recounts the telecom giant’s executives telling OAN creator Robert Herring Sr. that they wanted a conservative outlet that could sit alongside Fox News and balance out more liberal channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeUqyi"&gt;“They told us they wanted a conservative network,” Herring reportedly said in a 2019 court deposition. “When they said that, I jumped to it and built one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIFFAr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;’ story draws on records from the companies’ tumultuous legal history, including an OAN complaint against AT&amp;amp;T and a retaliation lawsuit filed against OAN by a former producer. The report, disputed by AT&amp;amp;T in statements to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, details a close relationship between the two companies that goes well beyond a simple carriage agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="an10Jf"&gt;Although OAN is carried by multiple cable services, a company accountant testified last year that AT&amp;amp;T provided 90 percent of Herring Networks’ income. If the channel had lost a carriage deal with then-AT&amp;amp;T subsidiary DirecTV, an OAN lawyer told the court, “the company would go out of business tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9VZZbu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An OAN lawyer said without AT&amp;amp;T, “the company would go out of business tomorrow”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="POmkZb"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T objected to the reports. “DirecTV offers its customers a wide variety of programming, including many news channels that offer viewpoints across the political spectrum, but does not dictate or control programming on the channels. Any suggestion otherwise is wrong,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YE9Px2"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T originally picked up OAN — alongside Herring’s then-struggling luxury channel WealthTV — for its online U-verse platform. It reportedly made a never-completed offer to acquire a 5 percent stake in the company, and when AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/18/5727276/att-acquires-directv"&gt;announced plans to buy&lt;/a&gt; DirecTV in 2014, OAN court testimony claims that AT&amp;amp;T executive Aaron Slator offered to put the network on DirecTV in exchange for help with lobbying government regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6wTDt"&gt;The Herrings allegedly met with Federal Communications Commission officials to discuss the merger and also offered to “cast a positive light” on AT&amp;amp;T in news coverage. (AT&amp;amp;T told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; and the court that it never made such an offer, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608577/att-directv-tpg-deal-u-verse-att-tv-new-company"&gt;spun off DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, although it retains a majority stake.) OAN later sued the telecom for breaking its alleged deal, and following a settlement, AT&amp;amp;T added OAN to its DirecTV lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DryY2W"&gt;OAN garnered &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/an-inside-look-at-one-america-news-the-insurgent-tv-network-taking-pro-trump-to-new-heights/2017/07/05/7475f0a4-4fa2-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html"&gt;widespread attention in 2017&lt;/a&gt; for earning the approval of former President Donald Trump. But over the past year it’s become better known for promoting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21660572/youtube-suspends-oann-video-coronavirus-misinformation-monetization"&gt;false information about COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174682/smartmatic-voting-fraud-disinformation-retraction-fox-news-oann-newsmax"&gt;2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, including claims that have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/10/1026509404/dominion-sues-conservative-media-oan-newsmax-2020-election"&gt;drawn a defamation lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; from voting machine company Dominion. Online platforms like YouTube have faced pressure to demonetize or remove OAN’s content, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21660572/youtube-suspends-oann-video-coronavirus-misinformation-monetization"&gt;YouTube did briefly&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020. So far, AT&amp;amp;T has faced less public scrutiny — even though it may have played a much larger part in supporting OAN’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="9fdWTE"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Spectre x360 14. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best multimedia laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMlQz"&gt;Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd1MYR"&gt;There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TpBe8F"&gt;The best 17-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="il4fnj"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 is a super powerful gaming laptop for a high price. It pairs Intel’s 11th-Gen Core processors (a Core i7 or a Core i9) with Nvidia’s RTX 3000 series and a display with up to a 360Hz refresh rate. It’s quite portable for such a powerful gaming laptop, at just 0.8 inches thick. And it only requires one charging brick, so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="965k9S"&gt;There are other things to like, too. It has a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without it being too obnoxious for the office. You can also elect for a 165Hz QHD configuration, if you prefer to game at a higher resolution. While the Blade Pro 17 isn’t cheap, it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1dSlPb"&gt;The best creator laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Psf1Yd"&gt;If you’re a creative professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel. This model has a screen that can bend into six different positions, so you can use it as a clamshell, a tablet, a tent, and more. There’s a built-in stylus that never needs to charge, so you can draw away without worry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcLH1O"&gt;In addition to the innovative design, the ConceptD Ezel hsa great build quality. The white chassis is attractive and not too heavy (at least, considering the hardware inside this thing). The hinge is also quite sturdy, and I never had to worry about the screen sliding around in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL7rZ5"&gt;Almost everything else about this device is good, including the touchpad, port selection, and fingerprint reader. There’s even an RGB keyboard, which is more subtle than those you’ll find on gaming rigs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="et8pKb"&gt;The ConceptD 7 Ezel is pricey, and there are cheaper laptops out there that will suit creators’ needs just fine. But if you’re looking for a truly innovative laptop, this is it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nest Renew could make your smart home smarter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bU0JTETN52e0Jt0K0n-6X9FJQA=/0x90:3767x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957993/Person_Adjusting_Thermostat_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select Nest thermostats will soon be able to tell you when you are using green energy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google Nest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqvbPT"&gt;Google has announced several new features for its Nest thermostats centered around helping the smart home become a bigger partner in the battle against climate change. These features are wrapped up in a new service called Nest Renew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A194Cn"&gt;The service will use intelligent automation to allow the thermostats to communicate with energy providers and make it easier for Nest users to know when there is cleaner and / or cheaper energy on their local power grid. The device will then automatically adjust to use that energy at optimal times without you having to do a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ym1RA"&gt;Nest Renew is the “First program of its kind,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and it is entirely opt-in. It includes six main features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="F6Fcyz"&gt;Energy Shift — automatic shifting of heating and cooling to times when energy is cheaper and / or cleaner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="46XzlQ"&gt;Online dashboard — a rundown of how clean the energy a home is using is, based on time of day, so people can adjust when they use non-connected devices to take advantage of clean energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s1JuN8"&gt;Monthly Impact Reports — these track the impact using clean energy is having &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zDlGSZ"&gt;Energy Impact Program — an option to gamify your eco-friendly choices. Users collect Nest’s green leaves to earn a vote in how Nest directs funds to clean energy nonprofits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cSFjMh"&gt;Clean Energy Match — the ability to match estimated fossil fuel electricity use at home with &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/9/9696820/renewable-energy-certificates"&gt;renewable energy credits&lt;/a&gt; (RECs) from US solar and wind plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNfbiE"&gt;Schedule Tuneups — a new version of the existing Seasonal Savings feature that makes small adjustments to your HVAC schedule based on the time of year to optimize energy use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4SvLD"&gt;Nest’s existing demand-side response program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540015/psa-energy-saver-program-smart-thermostat-adjust-temperature-heat"&gt;Rush Hour Rewards&lt;/a&gt;, which is an energy-saving program where the utility company can remotely adjust a household’s thermostat to relieve pressure on the grid, will continue as a separate service. People can choose to run both services on their thermostat simultaneously, with the Rush Hour program taking priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HemXGp"&gt;Nest Renew will work on Nest’s newest thermostats, which are the third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, the Nest Thermostat E, and the Nest Thermostat. Visual indicators on the thermostat, emails, and activity summaries will tell Nest users when the various functions are active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff1mGJ"&gt;There are two levels to Nest Renew: Renew Basic, which is free and will be available across the continental US, and Renew Premium, which costs $10 a month and is limited to select markets at launch (Google didn’t say which). The premium tier adds two features for $10 a month; the Clean Energy Match, which is a way to match the fossil fuel energy used with &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/what-it-really-means-when-google-and-apple-say-they-run-on-100-renewable-energy-f6d1719fd865"&gt;renewable energy certificates&lt;/a&gt; that come from solar and wind plants in the US, and the option to pay utility bills through Nest Renew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AFrZL8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Energy Shift is the main feature of the new program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WKOdIe"&gt;The main feature of Nest Renew is Energy Shift, and this is available in both the paid and free plans. This will automatically shift heating and cooling energy use to times when energy is cleaner and / or cheaper. Ben Brown, director of Product Management at Nest, explained that it will use small shifts — such as pre-cooling a house five or 10 minutes before the wind starts dying down or new demand spikes causing new energy plants to come online. “It will be just small coordinations based upon the needs of the grid that don’t sacrifice comfort at all,” he said. Nest customers will be able to manually adjust their thermostats if at any given moment they decide they’d rather be more comfortable than more green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7b3zxZ"&gt;Depending on where you live and who your energy provider is, the power coming to your home could be generated by fossil fuels during one part of the day and wind or solar at another. Google says Energy Shift uses intelligent automation to make adjustments based on forecasts of the type of power on the grid. It then adapts energy use to prioritize clean energy. The company partnered with the non-profit&lt;a href="https://www.watttime.org/"&gt; WattTime&lt;/a&gt;, which has developed algorithms to determine the marginal emissions rates of the grid in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtWPCk"&gt;Energy Shift can also adjust around any “time-of-use” charges your energy provider might have. Time-of-use charges are when you are charged more for using electricity at, say, 7PM — when everyone is home cooking dinner and watching Netflix — than you would be if you did those activities at, say, 2AM. Time-of-use charging is prevalent in Europe and the UK but not so common in the US — yet. But it is coming. Energy providers see it as a way to incentivize people to use energy when there is less demand, helping them better balance demand on the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kc02x"&gt;Nest says Energy Shift is a way its customers can navigate this change. “Certain regions are making it mandatory to move over to time-of-use plans — California and Michigan, for example,” said Brown. “Nest Renew will empower customers to manage their consumption against these time-of-use plans to make sure they can minimize their energy bills.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JoXwR7GK5gwMAgL7jz7bNBN3tUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903683/Person_on_Couch_Viewing_Nest_Renew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nest Renew works with a near real-time  dashboard to help users see the type of energy on their local grid at certain times of day, allowing them to adjust their use in response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tzDUtA"&gt;Time-of-use rates can be tricky to navigate. Running your HVAC system, for example, isn’t as easy to time as, say, running the dishwasher — which is something you can put off. Having a smart thermostat manage those calculations could make it easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCX1S2"&gt;Nest says it’s hoping to roll out Nest Renew to more household devices in the future, tying in with its smart displays and Google Home ecosystem. “We want to look at opportunities to empower other devices to coordinate with the needs of the grid; a good example would be electric vehicles,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9I4yJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://rmi.org/"&gt;RMI&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit working to accelerate the country’s transition to clean energy, analyzed the Nest Renew program and concluded that products like this could reduce around 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year if 10 million households participate. That’s approximately 7 percent of the gap between today’s level of household emissions and the US’s current target, which aims to cut emissions in half by 2030. With close to 123 million households in the US, the impact smart, connected homes could have on the climate change challenge will be even greater if even more people participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khdMXr"&gt;Nest Renew will start in an invitation-only preview in the coming weeks. Sign up at &lt;a href="http://nestrenew.google.com"&gt;nestrenew.google.com&lt;/a&gt; to join the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV4xnr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdViZW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, October 6th, 11:35 am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: An earlier version of this article said that Monthly Impact Reports provided a rundown of how clean the energy a home is using is. After publication, a Nest spokesperson reached out to clarify that the Monthly Impact Reports track the impact of the service and a different feature, the online dashboard, is how users can see when clean energy is powering their homes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Alpha ZV-E10 review: interchangeable lens vlogging machine</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Warning: will likely lead to expensive lens purchases&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="g4iqqo"&gt;The Alpha ZV-E10 is Sony’s newest addition to its lineup of mirrorless cameras. At $799.99 with Sony’s 16-50 lens ($699.99 for just the body), it is the company’s second attempt at making a vlogging-oriented camera and the successor to last year’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features"&gt; ZV-1&lt;/a&gt;. It adds a headphone jack, more battery life, a larger sensor, and most importantly, an interchangeable lens design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7VHhX"&gt;You can think of it as a video-centric version of Sony’s more photography-oriented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836658/sony-a6600-a6100-camera-aps-c-mirrorless-price-specs-features"&gt;A6100&lt;/a&gt;. The A6100 and the ZV-E10 share the same 24mp APS-C sensor, but the lack of a viewfinder and the addition of a fully articulating screen makes the ZV-E10 better suited for filming yourself. And with the new flexibility of being able to swap lenses, this camera is a welcomed upgrade to the ZV-1 that allows novices to dip their toes in more advanced systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gblzVX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10791929"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D5x1yw"&gt;With the ZV-1, Sony recycled parts from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;RX100&lt;/a&gt; line to better fit vloggers. This included a fully articulating screen, a larger handgrip, tally lights, a new mic array, and a hot shoe for accessories. The ZV-E10 follows a similar path, but this time, it borrows parts from the Alpha line and remixes them for vlogging use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7579v"&gt;The most important thing with the ZV-E10 is that Sony brought the E-mount lens system to this lineup. A detachable lens system not only allows for much more flexibility in image quality and focal length but also gets a whole community of prosumers buying more accessories. The bad news is the ZV-line 24-megapixel APS-C sensor has a 1.5x crop factor when using full-frame lenses, which means that a 24mm full frame lens will provide a 36mm equivalent field of view on this camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hP8zpS1XFTtjgF-QWf_YJ-x50U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890183/bfarsace_290921_4781_01963.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A6600 and the ZV-E10 share the same 24-megapixel APS-C sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f3FjIO"&gt;The next welcomed upgrades over the ZV-1 are a USB-C port and a larger battery. Every piece of tech I use, outside of my five-year-old bike lights, now uses a USB-C cable, and goddamnit, that feels good. The larger battery is a much-needed improvement, but I was still needing two batteries to get through a day of casual filming. The E10’s NP-FW50 batteries are a hand-me-down from Sony’s older Alpha cameras that we often cited as a point of weakness in those systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4YuVs"&gt;On the left side of the camera, two plastic doors hide the USB-C port, a Micro HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a mic port (two features that are rare to see at this price point), while the battery compartment holds the SD card slot. Up top is a new physical switch for power along with a mode switching button, a record button, and a background defocus button. And while Sony kept the zoom toggle for use with the detachable power zoom 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, it also added a top dial for aperture or shutter speed adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZV-E10 has a USB-C port for charging and data transfer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the controls on the back of the camera are on the right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox70MK"&gt;Much like the ZV-1, the ZV-E10 does not have an electronic viewfinder (EVF), and although the three-inch articulating screen is plenty bright, even in direct sunlight, using an EVF feels far more immersive when taking both photos and videos for me. However, in a vlogging-first camera, I can understand why an EVF would be first on the list of features to cut. This camera is designed to be able to film oneself, first and foremost, with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmLYwg"&gt;There is also no built-in ND filter. Built-in ND filters are one of the few features of cinema cameras that I continually miss when using DSLR and mirrorless systems. There is nothing convenient about having to screw and unscrew pieces of glass onto lenses when filming on location, and it’s infuriating that the ZV-E10’s predecessor, the ZV-1, had this feature, but this camera does not. The upside is that the E10 has an interchangeable E-mount lens system, and I already own ND filters for all of my E-mount lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PlX46"&gt;The other drawback to this camera’s hardware is the lack of in-body optical stabilization. Instead, the ZV-E10 uses electronic stabilization that isn’t very effective in steadying handheld footage. A gimbal will be needed to get smooth shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a2keGa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10791270"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="0yaxZf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken on the ZV-E10 with the 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 lens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="oLdG5b"&gt;The ZV-E10 can take 24.2-megapixel photos, and when paired with the 16-50mm kit lens, the photos are crisp in good light. However, in lower light, and especially when pushed past 8000ISO (admittedly, that’s very high), photos take on a lot of grain and smoothing. This is the same sensor that Sony has been using in its A6000 lineup for a long time, and while it’s good for a quick capture, a faster, more expensive lens will be needed for low-light situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWMEx2"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="ZV-e10 Sample Footage|104229" data-volume-uuid="b30b2e4ad" data-volume-id="104229" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-224" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="PkM0AS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All sample footage was filmed with the Sony 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="AiuHxG"&gt;There was only one way to test this vlogging camera: make a vlog. I took this camera out for a day in Brooklyn to put its in-camera stabilization, defocus mode, and mic to the test. Tune in to my video above for video samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UviRBH"&gt;The ZV-E10 can record at up to 4k 30fps, with a crop, or 4k 24fps, without a crop. I was most eager to test the SteadyShot electronic stabilization. And since I was using the 16-50mm kit lens, I also had the more effective, “active” stabilization that uses optical stabilization built into the lens but, unfortunately, crops more of the image. While the video is certainly smoother at these levels of stabilization, there is a bit of a jitter that is most apparent in fine details, such as tree leaves or bricks. Tune into 01:16 for side-by-side comparisons of SteadyShot Standard, which uses the electronic stabilization, and SteadyShot Active, which uses both the electronic stabilization and in-lens optical stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GO-y8fquVW_V3kxN9sYyaOXWj6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890189/bfarsace_290921_4781_01994.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fully articulating 3” screen is bright, even in direct sunlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sXjOpj"&gt;Overall, the video quality at 4k 24fps is punchy, crisp, and offers a lot of control over depth of field to justify using it over a phone. But in low light, the kit lens struggles. And once you push the camera past 6400ISO, the image begins to fill with grain. I had to shoot most of the latter half of this vlog at 10000ISO, which made the autofocus hunt, the image underexposed, and overall presented a very pixelated video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTwLqa"&gt;I was disappointed with the mic quality and background defocus button as well. Unsurprisingly, the mic does very well when speaking from behind the camera, where my mouth was much closer to the pickup unit, but from in front of the camera, the audio quality was far less impressive. Although it is unlikely that audio from the built-in mics would sound as good as it would with an on-board shotgun mic, like my $60 Rode VideoMicro that I typically vlog with, my voice still sounds farther away and more processed than expected. And although the background defocus mode’s trick of opening up the lens aperture as much as possible to get the shallowest depth of field is great for beginners, I don’t think it’s valuable enough to devote a whole button to. Fortunately, you can change that: I programmed this button to toggle focus modes instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vsbaDA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10785074"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBZgsq"&gt;The freedom to swap lenses on a camera can be a scary dive into unknown, expensive territory, but it also gives this camera more flexibility over time. A new or different lens is an easy way to add value to any camera system. And while a good lens can ultimately be burdened by the sensor it is projecting light onto, it both holds value over time and can be used with newer cameras in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Fvmtko"&gt;For a vlogger looking to take the next step in image quality and creative control over what a phone can provide, the ZV-E10 is easy to use and beginner-friendly while providing easy ways to step up your game. Its low light capabilities could be better, but its $800 price tag makes it a great camera to learn from without taking the full leap into more expensive, harder-to-use systems. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch confirms major data breach after its source code and secrets leak out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GgCPMfDsO5jY4HkWDXhKPQvGDn8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959447/acastro_190923_twitch_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eay5cx"&gt;Twitch has confirmed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;has suffered a major data breach&lt;/a&gt;. “We can confirm a breach has taken place,” says a Twitch spokesperson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1445770441176469512"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “Our teams are working with urgency to understand the extent of this. We will update the community as soon as additional information is available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvVjBa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;Hackers have so far leaked data&lt;/a&gt; that includes source code for the company’s streaming service, an unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios, and details of creator payouts. An anonymous poster on the 4chan messaging board released a 125GB torrent earlier today, which they claim includes the entirety of Twitch and its commit history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m0Lv5R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We can confirm a breach has taken place. Our teams are working with urgency to understand the extent of this. We will update the community as soon as additional information is available. Thank you for bearing with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1445770441176469512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4BfU3a"&gt;The leak has been labeled as “part one,” suggesting that there could be more to come. While personal information like creator payments is included, this initial leak doesn’t appear to include passwords, addresses, or email accounts of Twitch users. Instead, the leaker appears to have focused on sharing Twitch’s own company tools and information, rather than code that would include personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty57ya"&gt;It’s not clear how much data has been accessed, though. Twitch says it’s working to understand its security breach, and it appears that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/q2h36a/lol_how_fitting/"&gt;some users&lt;/a&gt; are being asked to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MasterEchu/status/1445772592376258568"&gt;change their passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Until we understand the extent of this breach, we’d recommend changing your Twitch password and enabling two-factor authentication if you haven’t already done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYS7gv"&gt;The Twitch leak will be damaging for the game streaming service either way and particularly for creators who rely on Twitch to keep their earnings and information secure. The hack follows weeks of protest for Twitch to improve its service under the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620874/twitch-implements-improved-chat-filters"&gt;#DoBetterTwitch movement&lt;/a&gt;. Twitch streamers also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;took a day off in August&lt;/a&gt; to protest against the company’s lack of action against hate raids.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s good, bad, and missing in the Facebook whistleblower’s testimony</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kj8cgxiYLLFMxQBhRE0HFx6GMHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959302/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cbcyx6"&gt;Today let’s talk about Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony before the Senate: the good, the bad, and what ought to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18vEo1"&gt;For more than three hours on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/05/technology/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen#lawmakers-have-come-a-long-way-from-asking-questions-about-how-facebook-makes-money"&gt;Haugen addressed a subset of the Senate Commerce Committee&lt;/a&gt;. She appeared calm, confident, and in control as she read &lt;a href="https://www.franceshaugen.com/blog/b9xlswihkike7639nn4ie23odz9eqy"&gt;her opening remarks&lt;/a&gt; and fielded questions from both parties. While she brought more nuance to her critique than most Facebook critics — she supports Section 230, for example, and opposes a breakup of the company — she also said the company should declare “moral bankruptcy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="heGy18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“becoming an almost trillion-dollar company by buying its profits with our safety”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6jrzSH"&gt;“This is not simply a matter of certain social media users being angry or unstable, or about one side being radicalized against the other,” Haugen told Congress. “It is Facebook choosing to grow at all costs, becoming an almost trillion-dollar company by buying its profits with our safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5JnGe"&gt;The Senate largely ate it up. Long frustrated by Facebook’s size and power — and, one suspects, by its own inability to address those issues in any constructive way — senators yielded the floor to Haugen to make her case. During the hearing titled “Protecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower,” Haugen walked senators through most of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;, touching on ethnic violence, national security, polarization, and more during her testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFis8V"&gt;For their part, senators sought to paint the hearing in historic terms. There were &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/05/facebook-senate-hearing-frances-haugen/#link-OCJ4TMDCIFF3ZGLMWN4VEZ6F6M"&gt;repeated comparisons to Big Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, and a “Big Tobacco moment.” “This research is the definition of a bombshell,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who led the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMo39K"&gt;Over at Facebook, the strategic response team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;lobbed a half-hearted smear at Haugen&lt;/a&gt;, noting bizarrely that while at the company, she “had no direct reports” and “never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives.” If there’s a point in there, I missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxwktM"&gt;Ultimately, Haugen said little on Tuesday that wasn’t previously known, either because she said it on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; or it was previously covered in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FejiZk"&gt;What she might have done, though, is finally galvanize support in Congress for meaningful tech regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jQKg4"&gt;Let’s walk through Haugen’s testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PFtRSM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The good parts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Albbzw"&gt;One, Haugen identified real harms that are taking place on Facebook services. For example, she talked about documents which indicate that using Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/05/technology/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen/in-hearing-haugen-discusses-how-instagram-may-lead-teenagers-to-eating-disorders"&gt;can contribute to eating disorders in some teenagers&lt;/a&gt;. Too often, discussions about the harms of social networks is either abstract or emotional. The primary benefit of Haugen’s leaking is to bring some empirical rigor to those discussions — and to highlight the degree to which these issues are known, but not discussed, by Facebook executives. That’s powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKFJJm"&gt;In response, Facebook’s Monika Bickert &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donie/status/1445474828329181188"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that the same research shows that the majority of teenagers find that Instagram improves their well-being. But one of the hearing’s most powerful moments came when Haugen noted that only about 10 percent of cigarette smokers ever get cancer. “So the idea that 20 percent of your users could be facing serious mental health issues, and that’s not a problem, is shocking,” she said, citing leaked data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyEC7K"&gt;Two, Haugen highlighted the value of research in understanding problems and crafting solutions. For years now, we’ve watched Congress interrogate Facebook based on spurious anecdotes about who was censored or shadow banned, or what publisher was or wasn’t included on a list of trending topics, to no constructive end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="02oVDS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The problems here are about the design of algorithms — of AI.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go69Vx"&gt;It was refreshing, then, to see members of Congress wrestling with the company’s own internal data. Sen. Ted Cruz, rarely seen operating in good faith on any subject, largely set aside his questions about censorship to ask Haugen about data exploring the link between Instagram and self-harm. Facebook will say, not unfairly, that senators were largely just cherry-picking with these questions. But we have to ground these discussions in something — why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Facebook’s own research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPG2rX"&gt;Third, and maybe most potently, Haugen helped to shift the discussion of platform problems away from the contents of the speech they host and toward the design of the systems themselves. “The problems here are about the design of algorithms — of AI,” Haugen said, in response to a question about whether the company should be broken up. That wouldn’t solve anything, she said — the same engagement-based algorithms would likely create similar issues within the new baby Facebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHUgkl"&gt;Haugen posited regulation of algorithms — specifically, banning engagement-based ranking like Facebook and Instagram use today — as a way to avoid the First Amendment issues that come with attempting to regulate internet speech. As the scholar Daphne Keller has written, attempting to regulate speech algorithms &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2021/02/one-law-six-hurdles-congresss-first-attempt-regulate-speech-amplification-padaa"&gt;will likely trigger First Amendment scrutiny anyway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crde5C"&gt;Still, Congress seemed receptive to the idea that it ought to focus on broader system incentives, rather than stunts like the recent efforts in Florida and Texas to force platforms to carry all speech regardless of content. The details get tricky, but that shift would be a welcome one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J5zERo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trouble spots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk9Uyi"&gt;For all its positive aspects, Haugen’s testimony had some unfortunate aspects as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21kiKb"&gt;One, Haugen came across as a solutionist: someone who believes that any problem created by tech can therefore also be solved by tech. This comes across most strongly in her advocacy for a reverse-chronological feed, which she argues would remove incentives to share polarizing or harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H9Epdn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fox News viewership tends to shift people’s political opinions more than Facebook usage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aX7slS"&gt;It seems possible that this is true but only marginally. Polarizing and harmful content was often shared on Twitter and Instagram during the many years that those services used reverse-chronological feeds. That’s not to say reducing algorithmic amplification is a bad idea, or that Facebook shouldn’t research the issue further and share what it finds. But given the broad range of harms identified in the Facebook Files, I found it surprising that Haugen’s pet issue is feed ranking: I just don’t believe it’s as powerful others seem to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LU9hsI"&gt;My second, somewhat related concern is that Haugen’s testimony had tunnel vision. Those of us who opine about social networks are forever at risk of attempting to solve society-level problems at the level of the feed. To avoid that, we have to bring other subjects into the conversation. Subjects like how the US was growing polarized long before the arrival of social networks. Or the research showing that long-term Fox News viewership tends to shift people’s political opinions more than Facebook usage. Or the other reasons teenagers may face a growing mental health crisis, from growing inequality and housing insecurity to the threat of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNAsyH"&gt;It’s possible to consider a subject from so many angles that you find yourself paralyzed. But it’s equally paralyzing to begin your effort to rein in Big Tech with the assumption that if you can only “fix” Facebook, you’ll fix society as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evSDtE"&gt;Finally, Haugen’s testimony focused on the documents, rather than her own work at Facebook. I can’t have been alone in wanting to hear more about her time on the Civic Integrity team or later working in counterespionage. But senators were more interested in the admittedly fascinating questions raised by the research that she leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S97S1U"&gt;That’s understandable, but it also meant that Haugen had to regularly remind the subcommittee that they were asking her questions in which she did not have expertise. In my own talks with current Facebook employees, this is the point on which I hear the most exasperation: just because you found some documents on a server, they tell me, doesn’t mean you are qualified to describe the underlying research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyqZbZ"&gt;There’s an obvious fix for that — summon more qualified employees to testify! But in the meantime, I wish Haugen had taken more opportunity to discuss what she saw and learned with her own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xHjsmQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should happen next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8Z4v35"&gt;Platforms should take the events of the past few weeks as a cue to begin devising ways to regularly share internal research on subjects in the public interest, annotated with relevant context and with data made available to third-party researchers in a privacy-protecting way. Facebook regularly tells us that most of its research shows that people like it, and the company’s market dominance suggests there is probably evidence to back it up, too. The company should show its hand, if only because soon enough governments will require it to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="34oitV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Haugen appears to have persuaded Congress that Facebook is as bad as they feared&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZChSmL"&gt;Congress should pass a law requiring large platforms to make data available to outside researchers for the study of subjects in the public interest. (Nate Persily &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/10/05/facebook-research-data-haugen-congress-regulation/"&gt;argues here that the FTC could oversee such a design&lt;/a&gt;.) I think sharing more research is in Facebook’s long-term self-interest and that the company ought to do so voluntarily. But to get an ecosystem-level view, we need more platforms to participate. Unless we want to rely on whistleblowers and random caches of leaked documents to understand the effects of social networks on society, we should require platforms to make more data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rumBsN"&gt;What Congress should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do is pass a sweeping law intended to solve every problem hinted at in Haugen’s testimony in one fell swoop. Doing so would almost certainly curtail free expression dramatically, in ways that would likely benefit incumbent politicians at the expense of challengers and marginalized people. Too many of the bills introduced on these subjects this year fail to take that into account. (Unless they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; taking it into account, and quashing dissent is their ulterior motive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goZ0nM"&gt;Instead, I’d like to see Congress do a better job of naming the actual problem it’s trying to solve. Listening to the hearing, you heard a lot of possibilities: &lt;em&gt;Facebook is too big&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Facebook is too polarizing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Facebook doesn’t spend enough on safety&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Facebook is a national security risk&lt;/em&gt;. There still appears to be no consensus on how to prioritize any of that, and it’s fair to wonder whether that’s one reason Congress has had so much trouble advancing any legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21xgVB"&gt;In the meantime, right or wrong, Haugen appears to have persuaded Congress that Facebook is as bad as they feared, and that the company’s own research proves it. Simplistic though it may be, that narrative — &lt;em&gt;Facebook is bad, a whistleblower proved it&lt;/em&gt; — is quickly hardening into concrete on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1FmAf"&gt;The question, as ever, is whether our decaying Congress will muster the will to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
