    <title>New York City passes new protections for delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A black-and-white image of three delivery workers dressed in casual clothing, their bikes visible in the background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDg55SZjRemXt3JnEv74_y22J-c=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899816/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photograph by Philip Montgomery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wwy31Q"&gt;On Thursday, New York’s city council passed a package of six bills establishing new rights and protections for delivery workers, making it the first major city to address the intense working conditions associated with food delivery. Mayor DeBlasio has previously expressed support for the provisions and is expected to sign them into law without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQVPFH"&gt;Passage of the bills was &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2021/9/22/22687983/nyc-landmark-food-delivery-worker-pay-bathrooms"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a local non-profit newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4GCtO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; feature earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; detailed the intense conditions faced by delivery drivers who serve apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats. Wage theft is common, as is physical assault, and pay can fluctuate wildly. Because of the gig work model, there is little security against on-the-job injuries or earnings shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l7CAX"&gt;The measures passed today don’t address every danger faced by those workers, but they establish many long-sought protections. One measure requires most restaurants to let delivery workers use their bathrooms and institutes fines for bars and restaurants that refuse access. Another will establish minimum per-trip payments, similar to existing protections for Uber and Lyft drivers. Other measures would block apps from charging fees to deliver tips to workers (seen by labor advocates as a form of wage theft) and institute limits on how far a worker can be asked to travel for a delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65KcXV"&gt;The bills are the result of sustained organizing by Los Deliveristas Unidos, a group organizing delivery workers as part of the Worker’s Justice Project. The group rallied at City Hall in April and has been pushing the mayor and city council for months to take action on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kf9tT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse launches ‘Wave,’ a new way to pull friends into audio chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0B6hqXjfCL3dctunmC-NBn8kQE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899782/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bFc0AK"&gt;After the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679897/clubhouse-waves-invites-audio-rooms"&gt;was leaked last week&lt;/a&gt;, Clubhouse is officially launching a new way to invite people to audio chats called “Wave.” The company &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/wave-clubhouse-new-feature/"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; at a surprise town hall on Thursday and is enabling the feature today for all users on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAJUJg"&gt;With Wave, you can invite friends to a live audio room just by tapping a waving hand emoji. Once they receive their invitation, they can choose to join your call and immediately get added to an audio room. The company’s blog explains in a bit more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YTPZJd"&gt;To send a Wave, swipe right on the Hallway or tap the dots icon at the bottom left of the screen. Then tape the wave button next to the person you’d like to chat with. They’ll get a notification that you said hello, and know that you’re open to chatting. If they are too, they can join a private room with you — open just to the people you waved at. You can keep it to one social circle, introduce friends from different groups to each other, or open the room up more broadly and make it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3JyxGcw78sU5mwxmePOw8IpUDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872988/Wave_Infographics__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each Wave will send a notification that your friends can respond to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PqGeD0"&gt;If someone doesn’t immediately respond, you can continue to use Clubhouse as you normally would. The company also says, to avoid confusion, if you have the app on in the background, you won’t immediately be pulled into a room if someone responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErBo5P"&gt;Clubhouse seems to want to encourage more causal, social, small moments in its app, which as of late has seemed to become associated with professional, appointment-based experiences. The company brought its app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22424399/clubhouse-android-app-release-date-news-features"&gt;to Android in May&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;removed its waitlist in July&lt;/a&gt;, which means there might be more people to casually talk to than when the app first launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zezSxa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9/23 3:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added image from Clubhouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California passes law targeting Amazon labor algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFtD_77gjad7YgsoneDn_Mo57tg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835223/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbtOLW"&gt;California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a bill Wednesday that would block Amazon and other companies from punishing warehouse workers who fail to meet certain performance metrics for taking rest or meal breaks. The California Senate approved the measure earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzGMsr"&gt;The law allows warehouse workers to challenge performance goals that many say discourage them from taking bathroom breaks or other rest breaks throughout the work day. The bill was written in response to high rates of reported injuries at Amazon warehouses where performance quotas are algorithmically enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uZZrNl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KD88R7"&gt;The law does not explicitly name Amazon in its text, but both Republican and Democratic lawmakers recognize that the e-commerce giant would be greatly affected by the enactment of the legislation. Over the last few years, Amazon has come under intense criticism for its performance quotas with several outlets reporting that workers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;peed in bottles&lt;/a&gt; as a means of meeting their warehouse fulfillment goals and maintaining their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CetAi"&gt;The law will also force companies like Amazon to make these performance algorithms more transparent, disclosing quotas to both workers and regulators. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxRT26"&gt;Still, supporters of the new law have presented it as a breakthrough against algorithmic monitoring of workers generally. “The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections against unsafe algorithmic-enforced quota systems used by corporations like to push warehouse workers’ bodies to the breaking point,” Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LorenaAD80/status/1435746747226066946?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ5EmZ"&gt;Business groups have come out &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/business/economy/amazon-labor-california-senate.html"&gt;in opposition of the bill&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that it would harm the industry by empowering employees to file lawsuits that could be costly and time-consuming for companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOhBl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 9/23/21 at 3:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and body text to reflect the bill was signed into law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max can now show visual responses and the UI in Spanish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j5XW3Zhz9_tlOlapPWfxF7aqlJ8=/166x0:1957x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899646/Google_Nest_Hub___Google_Duo___Spanish.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google Duo call with the UI in Spanish.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="meHCnF"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/spanish-nest-hub-and-hub-max-us/"&gt;expanding Spanish language support&lt;/a&gt; for its Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max devices in the US. Perhaps the biggest change is that the entire UI for the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max has been translated into Spanish. That means things like visual answers to your queries and control panels now appear in Spanish, Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IczE-3icc3k6mC6po_XSjSCy-rI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872792/Google_Nest_Hub___Your_Day_Screen___Spanish.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub’s UI in Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kUiqWM"&gt;Google has added a handful of new commands that might be useful around the house. One lets you add items to a shopping list — Google gives the example command, “Hey Google, agrega huevos a mi lista de compras” (which translates to “Hey Google, add eggs to my shopping list”). Another lets you call friends and family on Google Duo by saying something like “Hey Google, llama a mamá” (“Hey Google, call mom”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INz2Jy"&gt;Two new features make it easier to enjoy music and video from streaming services. You can ask Google to play music from “several” free and subscription music services on their Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max, while people with a YouTube TV subscription can stream Univision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwCSzW"&gt;You can also try out the Mexican Bingo game “Lotería” right on your Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max, and you can play in English or Spanish. In Spanish, you can start playing it by saying, “Hey Google, habla con &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000268d183d8a?e=-WebDirectoryEmbeddedWebviewExperiment&amp;amp;jsmode=o"&gt;Loteria Don Clemente&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Surface Laptop Studio isn’t as original as Microsoft would have you believe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VHBysXNMSvCzDRJTx_o0vA53heU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899608/vpavic_210921_4770_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tcr1Hc"&gt;Okay, I know this might be partially my fault. When I reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Microsoft’s 13.5-inch Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt; last year, I complained that the design was dated. I complained that my biggest nitpicks about the Surface Book 2 (which I’ve owned for years, by the way) hadn’t been fixed. Microsoft still hadn’t figured out how to do anything new or fun with the detachable, I lamented. “This form factor might be a dead end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XsRvvH"&gt;I love the Surface Book and am a staunch defender of the line. I couldn’t see myself using anything else as my primary driver. I hoped — prayed — that my words would result in Microsoft releasing a slimmer, sleeker, better Surface Book 4. I hoped they’d spur Microsoft into pushing the full-sized detachable workstation, a form factor that really only Microsoft has ever mastered, to heights it had never seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6QOqz"&gt;Unfortunately, Microsoft appears to have done the opposite. The Surface Book line, it appears, is no more. Instead, we got the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686706/microsoft-surface-studio-laptop-design-specs-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, a product that Microsoft is pushing as a groundbreaking innovation, but which is really — as anyone who closely follows PC releases can tell you — a step backward out of the innovative space and into territory that’s more familiar to the laptop sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oDJ4bo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Surface Laptop Studio is Microsoft’s new powerful flagship laptop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ExnKW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of doing something — anything — new with the Surface Book form factor, Microsoft has gotten rid of it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XJAFtP"&gt;So this Surface Laptop Studio is a laptop with a 360-degree hinge. A stylus lives on the bottom edge. You can use the device like a regular clamshell. You can pull the display forward over the keyboard and prop it up right above the touchpad like a little tent (a position Microsoft is calling “stage mode”). Or you can flip the display around, over the hinge, and use the thing like a tablet. Those are the only three positions — the hinge can’t hold the screen at whatever angle you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WSR7J2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOb31Uc4XKM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tOoAp9"&gt;Now, Microsoft is pitching this as the next step for the Book line: a new, innovative form factor. “It is the culmination of years of Surface innovation — on hinges, display, silicon, and more,” Microsoft’s vice president of devices said of the Studio. CEO Satya Nadella declared that the company was “creating a new laptop category.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgLZZv"&gt;But if you follow the laptop market anywhere near as closely as I do, it’s hard not to look at this device and think, “Oh boy, another one of these.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kJ4MpW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel is the dream computer I’ll never own","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"},{"title":"Acer Predator Triton 900 review: weird flex","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691638/acer-predator-triton-900-review-price-specs-features"},{"title":"HP Elite Folio review: style over substance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22620111/hp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MAx5PR"&gt;Just to catch up everyone else: This is not a new or unique design. For one, ThinkPads were doing something similar &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/THINK-A-brief-history-of-ThinkPads-from-IBM-to-Lenovo.418728.0.html"&gt;in literally 1994&lt;/a&gt;. But to pull a more modern example out of the air, HP’s been doing these for a couple years, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620111/hp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;2021 Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt; is basically this thing covered in leather. That laptop also has a stylus (though it lives in an arguably more convenient location just above the keyboard). HP declined to comment on the Surface Laptop Studio for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ba_FsbbYApDGiR-KOLJR88Rrvsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872631/1280px_ThinkPad_360PE_mid_fold.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wasn’t making that up. This is from 1994.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1FhZ2LiAvW97s_1nRTmtL3C_R90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872555/1280px_ThinkPad_360PE_tablet_mode.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one worked as a tablet, too. Look, there’s even a stylus!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YO5zYm"&gt;Acer (you know, that small, obscure laptop manufacturer) was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/31/4380132/acer-aspire-r7-review"&gt;doing a similar form factor&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2013. It has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691638/acer-predator-triton-900-review-price-specs-features"&gt;gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; that’s kind of like this. It has a whole line of creator-oriented workstations that are basically this. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22430445/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review"&gt;ConceptD Ezel&lt;/a&gt; is actually a more advanced form of this design with more powerful components (as Acer pointed out to me when I pinged the company for comment). That screen can stay put at whatever angle you want, so you can float it at infinite angles above the deck, use it as a reverse-clamshell with the screen facing away from (but still perpendicular to) the keyboard, or put it in any number of other positions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9hWhUGj5UMlbdmNHGxIBLl5248=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868476/vpavic_210921_4770_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Studio from the back. Mmmm. Laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cTUi65"&gt;The Laptop Studio can’t even make a cost-savings case against these two laptops. Its base model (with a Core i5, integrated graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage) &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Laptop-Studio%2F8SRDF62SWKPF%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-f5c%26selectedColor%3D%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $1,599.99&lt;/a&gt;, and the stylus and its charger are an extra $164.98 together; a comparable &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeSurfaceLaptopStudio092321&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-elite-folio-135-inch-2-in-1-notebook-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt; (stylus included) is currently listed at $1,416, and a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeSurfaceProStudio092321/https://store.acer.com/en-us/conceptd-3-ezel-cc314-72g-72sx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ConceptD 3 Ezel&lt;/a&gt; (stylus included) with a Core i7, a discrete GPU, and twice the storage is $1,499.99. And before you all start on build quality — the Elite Folio and the ConceptD are both very nice laptops with excellent keyboards and touchpads. They’re premium devices targeting a deep-pocketed crowd. (I mean, the Elite Folio is literally covered in leather.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HWdM8"&gt;And in addition to these direct competitors, there are various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; clones that serve a pretty similar use case. To be clear, the old Surface Book and new Surface Laptop Studio are very different from the Surface Pro and its ilk: they’re full-sized laptops with chips in their base (and optional discrete GPUs), while Surface Pros are Windows tablets to which you can attach a keyboard and kickstand. But I think the case for a Surface Book over a Surface Pro is still much stronger than the case for a Surface Laptop Studio over a Surface Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XSsE1V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;While the Surface Laptop Studio may be a great device, it’s not a new laptop category&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1y5tc8"&gt;Think about it: the Surface Laptop Studio only has three positions, and something like the Surface Pro or the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;ThinkPad X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt; can be in all those positions as well. It can be a clamshell laptop or a tablet, and detaching the keyboard but leaving the kickstand up will serve the same use case as stage mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcRd0M"&gt;In short, while the Surface Laptop Studio may be a great device, it’s not a new laptop category. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Folio in easel mode, angled to the right, on an outdoor table with a river in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bb-dz7b8Yz58uqzE7n2TyIrKMWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774696/mchin_191104_4704_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the HP Elite Folio. Hmmm, look familiar?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IZYqMk"&gt;And that’s okay! A laptop doesn’t need to be a new category to be a compelling buy. And the Studio certainly has some advantages over HP’s and Acer’s lines. It has a more powerful processor than the Folio, which is powered by a Snapdragon chip. And perhaps most crucially, it has a higher resolution screen than both of those models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEhMDa"&gt;But I’m still not convinced that this laptop will court fans of either of those devices. They’re both targeting fairly specific audiences who are uniquely suited to this sort of convertible form factor, and they fit those audiences very well. It could have more success creating converts from the Surface Pro sphere, especially those who want a larger screen than those tablets offer. But those folks will also have to pay a bit more for that real estate. A comparable &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fconfigurator%2Fcto%2Findex.html%3FbundleId%3D20UWCTO1WWUS1%26ecpn%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F23%2F22688432%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-studio-book-3-specs-step-backwards" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ThinkPad X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt; (stylus and keyboard included) is a good $300 cheaper than this laptop as of this writing. The Surface Pro 8 is also a bit cheaper, even if you add the price of the type cover. The Laptop Studio’s extra inches of screen may not be worth it to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bNZ9t"&gt;A bigger screen also means a heftier body — both of those detachable devices (with their keyboards on) are over a pound lighter than the Studio, which is also heavier than the Surface Book 3. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel with the screen floating above the keyboard, seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDVOBYAJugfuuZkRbCZhLUJ5ugI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490293/akrales_20210503_4515_0071.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an Acer ConceptD Ezel. Wee, look what this thing can do!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J1X1YM"&gt;My best guess is that the Surface Laptop Studio is best positioned to appeal to people who were already fans of the Surface Book line. And as a member of this apparently small group, this is where I’m really hung up. Because while pretty much everything about the Surface Book was good, the reason I was willing to pay such a high price for it was the innovation behind it. It was an &lt;em&gt;impressive &lt;/em&gt;device; Microsoft was the only company making it. It met a unique combination of needs that no other laptop in the world could meet. In my past few years as a Surface Book owner, I’ve considered switching to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS&lt;/a&gt; many times, but I just could never do it — I just couldn’t give up that detachable screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYqEW6"&gt;Sure, the Surface Book wasn’t perfect. But it was something different — and in the crowded and competitive laptop space, it’s rare to see a laptop that’s truly one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM6Ie7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says the original Surface Duo will get Android 11 before the end of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQ2mngOvSwDTvhWyRP24eZCldbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69899054/vpavic_4176_20200905_0038.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bhD1iS"&gt;Microsoft announced a new Surface Duo 2 this week that’s shipping with Android 11, and now the company is committing to release the OS update for original devices this year. “We remain committed to providing updates to Surface Duo, and we’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRRzj2"&gt;That’s not a firm release date, but then we’ve never had one for Android 11 on the Surface Duo. &lt;a href="https://www.drwindows.de/news/surface-duo-android-11-kommt-im-sommer-microsoft-mit-langfristigem-bekenntnis"&gt;Previous reports&lt;/a&gt; suggested it would land in the summer, but as we move closer to fall and there was no mention at Microsoft’s Surface event, it’s clearly taking longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Duo 2 has larger screens." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8r3JkoPUphqvwT1L9JZeafRVesE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868420/bfarsace_210921_4770_0031.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 has larger screens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uUCkHe"&gt;We’re still waiting to hear exactly what Android 11 on the Surface Duo will bring. Android 11 has native support for dual-screen devices like the Duo, so it should improve some of the software experiences on the device. During our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686707/microsoft-surface-duo-2-phone-design-specs-features-photos-hands-on"&gt;brief look at the Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like  Android 11 brings minor tweaks to Microsoft’s multitasking system, rather than an overhaul. The Surface Duo 2 now defaults to assuming that the right-hand screen is the primary one, but it’s not clear if that same change will come to the original Surface Duo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMaRNm"&gt;While Microsoft has shipped a number of updates for the Surface Duo, it has still remained a fairly buggy device. Surface Duo users have complained of regular issues with multitasking and gestures, a screen turning off during book mode, and lockups using the fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8cVY5"&gt;Android 11 will now arrive just as Google moves on to Android 12. We’re expecting Android 12 to debut on Pixel devices imminently, and it’s not clear when the Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2 will be updated. Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366636/microsoft-surface-duo-android-updates-three-years-support-security"&gt;previously committed&lt;/a&gt; to three years of OS and security updates for the Surface Duo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Calendar events now include a way to start group chats with attendees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ydTMTc_bB1yPjHmnelquTdJnFQs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898950/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0ZlT5"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/easily-chat-with-meeting-participants.html"&gt;adding a new button to Google Calendar events&lt;/a&gt; on mobile and the web that will immediately open a chat with meeting attendees. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;launched its rebranded version of Hangouts Chat&lt;/a&gt; to customers earlier this year and has slowly added more features to the main Gmail landing page, including its Zoom-like Google Meet video chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkDPoU"&gt;The new Chat button appears next to the attendee list in a Calendar event. Previously, Google only offered the ability to email attendees about a meeting, but since the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325966/google-gmail-g-suite-chat-rooms-meet-integration-redesign"&gt;has closely integrated Chats and Gmail&lt;/a&gt; — seemingly to popularize Chats — this new addition makes sense. You can start a chat before, during, or after the meeting with attendees, and the feature will be toggled on by default.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGSsSTpxuDbeNAvFCbYQJi2mS-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872378/pasted_image_0__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Chat button appears next to Google’s original email button on calendar events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TXK8AX"&gt;It’s worth noting, though, the automatic group chats “only [apply] to participants within your organization, external attendees are not included in the chat group,” Google writes in a post. So some participants might be spared (or miss, whichever you prefer) the extra messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ob5RPT"&gt;Google clearly wants you to use its messaging apps, despite what its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;confusing, ever-changing strategy&lt;/a&gt; might suggest. It might be annoying to be funneled towards Chat in yet another section of Google’s software suite, but for anyone who’s committed themselves to Google Workspace — or been forced to do so by their employer — here’s some added convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lGHQu6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to activate and use Google Chat ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22533079/google-chat-rooms-gmail-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Twitter enables tipping with Bitcoin, plans to let users authenticate NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4QGS1fAnQ_1BYai5ZJQSHH1bhTY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898748/Twitter_NFTs.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;People will be able to mark their NFTs as legitimate on Twitter. | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VX8loq"&gt;Twitter is turning on the ability to ask for tips in Bitcoin through its app, making it the first major social network to encourage use of the cryptocurrency as a method of payment. The company also plans to let users connect their crypto wallets and authenticate the ownership of NFTs they tweet with a special badge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoNL7L"&gt;Twitter has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;testing tipping&lt;/a&gt; for a few months now, but the company hasn’t made tips widely available until Thursday, when the feature is rolling out globally on iOS with Android to follow. Besides Bitcoin, Twitter will let users connect nine traditional payment providers, including Venmo and Cash App, to their profiles to accept tips. Twitter isn’t processing the payments itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioQh7w"&gt;The Bitcoin tips are facilitated by Strike, a Bitcoin wallet app that runs on the Lightning Network protocol. Lightning is designed to enable faster and cheaper transactions using Bitcoin. The company behind it has received funding from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a staunch Bitcoin advocate who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1403174877444587523"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was “only a matter of time” before Twitter supported payments via the protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sZVP5"&gt;Strike works in all US states except New York and Hawaii, and the country of El Salvador. In addition to their Strike usernames, Twitter users will also be able to add their Bitcoin addresses to their profile, which people can then copy and paste into their crypto wallet of choice to send tips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_BNpXY0DOqMruhMttJ7soMJgI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22872472/Static_Sending_a_Bitcoin_tip_through_Strike.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How tipping with Bitcoin works on Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJKhlA"&gt;Twitter’s app will notify someone when they receive a Bitcoin tip via Strike, letting them quickly reply to the tipper to say thanks or send an emoji reaction. Twitter will also generate invoices for creators to track the tips they receive. “Bitcoin represents one of the best solutions” for enabling people to transact in underbanked regions of the world, Esther Crawford, Twitter’s product lead for creator monetization, said Thursday during a call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWVWnr"&gt;Bitcoin isn't the extent of Twitter’s crypto plans: the company said it is also planning to support authentication for NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, by letting people connect their crypto wallets. “NFT authentication will come in the form of a badge, shown on profile pictures, marking the owner’s NFT as authentic,” a company spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NATfFZ"&gt;NFTs have recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;boomed in popularity&lt;/a&gt; as a way to buy and trade digital art on the Ethereum blockchain. A few months ago, the main Twitter account &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/"&gt;did a giveaway&lt;/a&gt; of NFTs that were minted on a marketplace called Rarible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-bike maker Cowboy finally moseys its way to the US from Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWBT9b5BLtHWvWdMd2M1GFPZYBs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898718/ahawkins_210919_4769_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J1YpJ4"&gt;Belgium’s finest electric bike maker, Cowboy, is crossing the pond and expanding its operations to the US. Cowboy will only have one model available to American customers: its fourth-generation e-bike, aptly named the C4. The C4 comes in a high-step or step-through frame and is available for pre-order for the early bird price of $1,990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZKAWb"&gt;This is a very big deal for Cowboy, which has quickly grown into one of the more interesting and impressive e-bike companies in Europe since its launch in 2017. Cowboy has raised $42 million in venture capital funding and sold over 25,000 bikes across 11 different European markets. And now they’re saddling up and heading to the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sBwgDG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve never done business in the US”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cBHbgB"&gt;“I’ve never done business in the US,” Cowboy co-founder and CEO Adrien Roose told me when we met up in Central Park in New York City earlier this week. “So it’s quite exciting for me personally.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l4A27LSaq_flnF91a2Rn-yW_HF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870207/ahawkins_210919_4769_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfs2yd"&gt;Roose credits the rise of electric scooter- and bike-sharing services like Bird and Lime, in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258412/city-bike-lanes-open-streets-ebike-sales-bicyclist-pedestrian"&gt;Covid pandemic and the effect on travel habits&lt;/a&gt;, with the growing popularity of e-bikes and electric-powered mobility. He also cited the recent news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22590792/ebike-act-senate-brian-schatz-tax-credit-infrastructure"&gt;Congress may approve tax breaks for e-bike purchases&lt;/a&gt; as a factor in the growing level of excitement among e-bike companies for the US market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEcbHl"&gt;“We’ve seen strong signs that the US has reached some form of inflection points,” he said. “We really feel that the time is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPJBa3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has been tracking Cowboy’s progress for a number of years. We called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18656321/cowboy-e-bike-preview-price-date-removable-battery"&gt;Cowboy 2&lt;/a&gt; “the best looking pedal-assisted electric bike with a removable battery” and the &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;Cowboy 3&lt;/a&gt; a more “mature” e-bike that was focused on “on safety rather than fun.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3C62bv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The C4 is a complete overhaul of the previous generations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZA91G"&gt;The C4 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;a complete overhaul of the previous generations&lt;/a&gt;, with 50 percent more torque and a new integrated “cockpit” with Quadlock mount that wirelessly charges your phone as you ride. I got a chance to ride the high-step C4 around Central Park this week and found the pedal-assist to be nearly instantaneous and incredibly intuitive. Hill climbing was a breeze, and the elegant, simplified design was extremely easy on the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSQcOl"&gt;The C4 reminded me a great deal of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;S3 by VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, Europe’s other maker of beautiful e-bikes. VanMoof has been selling e-bikes in the US for a number of years, and it’s likely that Cowboy will be competing with many of the same customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCGVwa"&gt;VanMoof is definitely larger and sells more e-bikes than Cowboy. But the Dutch company isn’t without its missteps. Last year VanMoof was hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;hundreds of customer complaints&lt;/a&gt; about bikes that were scuffed or damaged upon delivery. Others complained about wobbly wheels, faulty brakes, or a wide range of cryptic error codes that flash on their disabled bike’s display. The Dutch company said it would direct some of the money it has raised in venture capital toward addressing these issues of delivery and quality control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LifBwP"&gt;By comparison, Roose was quick to tout Cowboy’s high customer satisfaction ratings and also the company’s unique approach to software. “In terms of comparing value proposition with Cowboy, there’s really only VanMoof,” he said. “And because we believe that we already have an edge in terms of software, we see ourselves a bit creating our own category with connected e-bikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV63Kf"&gt;Cowboy’s customers can connect with one another on the company’s app for shared rides, where they can also compare stats related to health and fitness. It’s not something you see from a lot of e-bike companies, most of which are focused on battery power, motor performance, and other metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rlu41o"&gt;Roose said the hope is that Cowboy can help change the conversation around e-bikes, with many cycling purists dismissing battery-powered biking as cheating. He noted that there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963426/ebike-exercise-fitness-heart-rate-study-science-electric-bike"&gt;several studies refuting this notion&lt;/a&gt; that e-bikes don’t provide any health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZGADC"&gt;“When you ride on an e-bike, you get to charge your vascular system that’s high enough to make an impact,” he said. “And people who have an e-bike, they use e-bikes more often and to go further.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49gSEr"&gt;To start out, Cowboy’s mobile service and support team will be available in eight US cities, in which customers can make appointments through the app. Customers who live in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC, will have access to the company’s remote repair team. Preorders for the C4 can now be placed at Cowboy’s website, with the first bikes expecting to ship in January 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will open its fiber networks to expand broadband access in rural Virginia</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oj8PzK"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/network-moments-virginia/"&gt;announced a new project&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that will bring broadband service to thousands of households in Virginia this fall, in partnership with a local ISP and utility company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0Q8vi"&gt;The project began with fiber networks Facebook was already building to connect its data centers in Virginia, Ohio, and North Carolina. With that fiber already laid, Facebook partnered with Appalachian Power and GigaBeam Networks to extend the networks to roughly 6,000 households in Grayson County, VA. The homes are projected to have high-speed broadband access by the end of this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KdIgqs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These are really complicated problems that we’re trying to solve”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDZvrf"&gt;“These are really complicated problems that we’re trying to solve. If they weren’t complicated, then we still wouldn’t have 19 million people that were unserved or underserved,” Michele Kohler, Facebook’s network investments team manager, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview Wednesday. “We’re trying to figure out how can we play in the equation, with these complex partnerships, to figure out how we can help people get connected faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4k9zSR"&gt;Kohler also said that Facebook is providing “engineering and technical resources” to the partnering companies. The proposed network would leverage a new law approved by the Virginia legislature last year that allows electric and communications companies to string fiber along existing poles and conduits. Still, the future of these networks is unclear as utility companies like &lt;a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/15/legal-challenge-slows-rural-broadband-plans-in-virginia/"&gt;Rappahannock Electric Cooperative&lt;/a&gt; have been sued by property owners for infringing on their property rights when they’ve sought to invoke the new provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lomoVl"&gt;Facebook’s announcement comes just a few months after Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) said that the state would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580559/virginia-broadband-household-ralph-northam-mark-warner"&gt;be investing $700 million&lt;/a&gt; from the American Rescue Plan to reach universal connectivity in the state by 2024. President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/American-Rescue-Plan-Fact-Sheet.pdf"&gt;signed the coronavirus relief package&lt;/a&gt; last March, providing Virginia with more than &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/may/headline-895119-en.html"&gt;$4 billion in relief&lt;/a&gt; — the pool of money being used to support universal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PjgVc"&gt;“I’m a big believer that with this level of high speed and connectivity, people won’t be forced to move away to cities to find good quality jobs,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said in a statement regarding Facebook’s plans Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGuwvw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
