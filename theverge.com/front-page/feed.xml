    <title>Twitter is testing notices that tell you if your account is suspended or locked</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s new banners informing users their account has been suspended or locked.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGt12C"&gt;Twitter is testing new notices that tell you if your account has been suspended or locked and has been put in read-only mode for violating Twitter’s rules. The notices, announced Tuesday, will show up as a banner at the top of your feed. They are in testing across a small percentage of Twitter users on iOS, Android, and the web, a Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWLuVG"&gt;The company is testing this feature after getting feedback from users that they realized they were suspended or locked and in read-only mode only after trying to tweet or follow new accounts, the Twitter spokesperson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OHWQIq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Knowing where your account stands is important. We’re testing a new way of letting you know — right when you log in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your account is locked or suspended, some of you will start seeing a banner making that clear. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fOP53keghz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fOP53keghz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1420074309998063619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dqv6gh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1420074309998063619"&gt;The new notices&lt;/a&gt; spell out your status and provide some additional guidance for those who are locked or suspended. If you’ve been permanently suspended, you can submit an appeal, according to one notice, and if your account has been locked, that notice says most accounts get full access back in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLuGNv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s controversial Safari redesign is now optional in the latest iPadOS 15 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2NTqG0Wv4fNyv2F5EnuN3SpDB4=/0x38:2388x1630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640581/Polygon.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s current tab design squashes tabs and the search window into a single row.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNRznX"&gt;Apple has started trickling out its fourth iOS and iPadOS 15 betas, taking additional steps back from the bold, and somewhat ill-advised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;reimagining of Safari it debuted at WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Now the “compact” tab experience in nu-Safari is entirely optional, and the more traditional separate row of tabs that were &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-beta-3-brings-redesigned-safari-tab-interface-to-address-complaints/"&gt;reintroduced in the third macOS Monterey beta&lt;/a&gt; are heading to iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abz55u"&gt;Like in macOS Monterey (and every version of Apple’s desktop OS in recent history), tabs will once again live in their own separate row by default, alleviating some of the crowding that made Apple’s initial compact redesign annoying. The tab experience is now also controlled via a toggle in the Settings app, so if you’re committed to Apple’s original vision, you can enable it with a tap. You can see how the new settings option looks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1420072648822951937"&gt;in this screenshot shared by Federico Viticci&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8oeYhdOpJD7nTm-832P-ao4o9gU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743862/E7Uci5YWQAgdOaW.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Federico Viticci&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabs now live in their own dedicated row by default in the fourth beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qM7Hck0QkrDPh71La9fp3p4IHj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22743788/E7Uci5VXsAIUWGc.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Federico Viticci&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Safari tab options in Settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OFYAZB"&gt;On iOS 15, the fourth beta also includes the return of the dedicated Reload button, one-tap access to Safari’s Reader mode, and a Share button, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/27/whats-new-in-ios-15-beta-4-safari-changes-focus-tweaks-and-more/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hj0pvY"&gt;These kinds of changes are what beta tests are for, and this all could entirely change again before the fall, but it is somewhat notable that this is the second major tweak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577475/apple-safari-macos-monterey-ios-15-developer-beta-3-change-design"&gt;Apple’s made to the new Safari&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s dealt with criticism over its design changes in the past (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2013/6/10/4416726/the-design-of-ios-7-simply-confusing"&gt;like iOS 7’s flat UI&lt;/a&gt;) but making tabs “normal” again by default does seem to suggest that on at least one element of the new Safari, Apple knows it got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CDC reinstitutes mask recommendations for some vaccinated people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Og6RtwKRIetQMQc19-jubMkD6h8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640536/acastro_200512_1777_faceMask_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5KSipX"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new recommendations today that people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 should wear masks in public, indoor settings in areas with high rates of disease. The CDC also said that students, teachers, and staffers should wear masks in school, even if they’re vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nl9Jw"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics issued &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/all-children-should-wear-masks-school-fall-even-if-vaccinated-n1274358?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma"&gt;similar recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for schools earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNYJ5D"&gt;The announcements are a reversal of the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;May guidance&lt;/a&gt; that fully vaccinated people did not need to wear masks in most situations. At that point, cases counts were falling around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS8b8D"&gt;Now, the highly contagious Delta variant is spreading around the country and cases are surging in most areas, particularly places with low vaccination rates. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious cases of the disease and death. But they’re not perfect, and some people who are fully vaccinated can still be infected with the virus. Data from the US and other countries shows that, in rare cases, people who are vaccinated and are infected can get sick and pass the virus to others, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a press briefing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSlmfB"&gt;“We thought it was important for people to understand that they can still infect someone. That is important in the case, for example, of vaccinated, individuals who might be going to visit an immunocompromised family member, we wanted to make sure that they have precautions necessary,” Walensky said. Still, “the vast majority of transmission occurring is occurring through unvaccinated individuals,” she said in today’s briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noFYe5"&gt;Some places, like Los Angeles County, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-18/la-county-indoor-masks-will-people-follow-rule"&gt;already reinstated mask mandates&lt;/a&gt; for everyone, regardless of vaccination status.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnFnSi"&gt;The CDC did not move more quickly to reinstate mask recommendations because it was worried about appearing to “flip-flop” on the issue, a senior Biden administration official &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/27/cdc-masks-guidance-indoors/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Masks have been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588755/covid-mask-guidance-bad-delta-surge"&gt;chaotic, charged issue&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of the pandemic, and people have been frustrated by shifting guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3ZCHb"&gt;Experts say the latest adjustment is an important call in the face of the Delta surge. The recommendations, though, aren’t mandates — it’s up to state and local governments to implement and enforce masking rules. At this point in the pandemic, after officials promised that the end was in sight, getting people to put masks back on &lt;a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/local-municipalities-push-back-on-mask-mandate-wildwood-ellisville-chesterfield/63-be7e05f1-c66c-4e38-a2a3-6bd2b4ebd246"&gt;might be a challenge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’ve been waiting to play Resident Evil Village on PC, Capcom’s fixed it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fP0UMwViQwtgPB2elRf6VRn9uNU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640522/RE_Village_Sept_Screens_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rK4C6W"&gt;If you bought &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; on PC but put off playing it due to horrible performance issues, you may be in luck. Over three months after the port’s release, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1417288163610005506"&gt;Capcom has released an update&lt;/a&gt; to fix performance issues related to DRM and, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-pc-is-fixed-but-players-deserve-more"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it appears to have resolved the larger performance issue, too. Before the patch, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-pc-is-fixed-but-players-deserve-more"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; frame rates tanking from over 100fps to around 30fps in certain scenes, making the PC version of the game significantly worse to play than the console version. The update also includes support for AMD’s upscaling tech to help improve your frame rates even more, if you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-fidelityfx-super-resolution"&gt;got a supported graphics card&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTrIkg"&gt;The problems, which may have been caused by DRM (though Capcom has not confirmed this) were noted both by &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-villages-pc-port-is-disappointing-and-needs-work"&gt;outlets like &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a good number of &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1196590/Resident_Evil_Village/#app_reviews_hash"&gt;reviewers on the game’s Steam page&lt;/a&gt; (though it is worth noting that the game does still have “Overwhelmingly Positive” Steam reviews overall). Some players noted hitches, stutters, and fps drops, mainly in combat when either killing an enemy or taking damage. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, these aren’t exactly ideal times for your game’s performance to tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uR6FzZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An important update for Resident Evil Village players on Steam:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) from AMD is now supported. FSR supports higher frame rates on PC for an improved gaming experience.&lt;br&gt;- Adjustments have been made to optimize the anti-piracy technology.&lt;/p&gt;— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1417288163610005506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fW4EbP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People who actually paid for the PC port were getting a worse experience than pirates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LU1G8Y"&gt;Worse for Capcom was that the pirated version of the game actually ran significantly better, according to &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;. A patch &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-pirate-says-cracked-release-fixes-1847266974"&gt;released by a pirate who goes by Empress&lt;/a&gt; meant to remove the game’s DRM also reportedly fixed the performance issues, meaning that people who paid for the PC port were getting a worse experience than both pirates and console players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5IdTN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgZewSIXawQ"&gt;has a comparison&lt;/a&gt; between the pre-patch, patched, and pirated versions, which you can watch down below. It provides a good look at what the issues were for those of us who hadn’t had the misfortune of playing the DRM-hampered version — to my eye, the stutters are so noticeable that it almost seems like an intentional effect (similar to how &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vaZi9hJbaeA?t=60"&gt;pauses for a split second&lt;/a&gt; after you parry off an attack). Shooting zombies with a shotgun causes the whole game to freeze before the muzzle flash is even off the screen, and encountering one of the game’s Maidens turns the game into a slideshow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PbeC7T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgZewSIXawQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="biuJ2E"&gt;The update also added support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution technology&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to maintain playable frame rates while running at higher resolutions. The tech achieves this by rendering the game at a lower resolution, then upscaling to your desired resolution, similarly to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;Nvidia’s DLSS&lt;/a&gt;, though the two technologies achieve this through very different means. Nvidia’s version uses AI that’s powered by special hardware included in its newer GPUs, where AMD’s tech &lt;a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution/"&gt;algorithmically upscales frames&lt;/a&gt; that have been anti-aliased. &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; also does a deep dive on FSR’s effect on &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;’s frame rate and image quality in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will deliver CES keynote as the Uncarrier moves mainstream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7LTQS6vVCjV-lBWgtrHMw7oUEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640464/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile crafted an underdog image for itself, but its recent moves have looked a lot more mainstream.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lzkqZ"&gt;Lately, T-Mobile has been looking less and less like the Un-carrier it styled itself as in the past, and much more like A Carrier. To that end, the company made a couple of announcements today: a new 5G coverage milestone, and that CEO Mike Sievert will be delivering a CES keynote in a spot recently occupied by Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IO0Tci"&gt;The Consumer Technology Association and T-Mobile made the keynote announcement today, with (you guessed it) 5G as the topic of the hour. It’s been the topic of that particular keynote slot in a couple of recent years, with Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg whipping up the 5G hype machine and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;covering roughly the same talking points&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJys7T"&gt;Sievert will take the microphone from Vestberg at the start of what’s likely to be a pivotal year for 5G in the US. Verizon will be starting to deploy the C-band spectrum in which it has invested heavily. No doubt, Sievert hopes to shine the spotlight on T-Mobile’s relative spectrum advantage, thanks to its Sprint acquisition last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OQPZl1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile aims to cover 200 million people with ultra capacity 5G by the end of 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjmiNG"&gt;He’ll also highlight milestones like the one T-Mobile announced today: 305 million people are covered by the company’s slower “extended range” 5G and 165 million covered by its faster, mid-band “ultra capacity” 5G network. With a little less than half a year to go, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fthe-current-state-of-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596307%2Ft-mobile-ceo-mike-sievert-ces-keynote-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile is driving toward its goal to cover 200 million people&lt;/a&gt; with ultra capacity 5G by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKDWXS"&gt;In contrast, Verizon, which has to wait for current tenants to clear off its new C-band spectrum, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-announces-c-band-auction-results" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expects to cover 100 million people&lt;/a&gt; with mid-band 5G in early 2022. Sievert probably &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; discuss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;the network’s bare-minimum efforts to uphold its merger commitments and help position Dish as a competitor&lt;/a&gt;, even though the deal is responsible for delivering T-Mobile its valuable mid-band spectrum and its relative “lead” in 5G, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ngTHLj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sievert probably &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; discuss the network’s merger commitments to help position Dish as a competitor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3yMrl"&gt;T-Mobile is eagerly seizing the moment as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T work to get C-band deployed, but the more time it spends in the spotlight, the harder it will be to maintain its cool, underdog image. In the meantime, we can definitely expect to see less red and a lot more magenta on consumer tech’s biggest stage early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram Reels can now be twice as long</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dPk7B0-rrYTKj9bBoLuRsb3GUGs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640372/akrales_200423_3988_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="12Y4Gb"&gt;Instagram Reels can now be up to one minute long, double the previous 30-second time limit. Instagram initially debuted Reels with a brief 15-second time cap, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452278/instagram-reels-update-longer-videos-length-trim-edit"&gt;quickly doubled it&lt;/a&gt; just a month later. Reels is now nearly a year old, so it seems it’s time for an update again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZF73s"&gt;Until recently, TikTok also capped videos at 60 seconds long, and it’s with that time constraint that the platform really blew up. So it’s probably wise that Instagram is expanding its short video limit to give creators a little more space to work with. TikTok’s longer limits were better for cooking videos, storytelling, and plenty more, and they still maintained the app’s quick-flipping pace of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3hOG7"&gt;TikTok recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;expanded its limit to three minutes&lt;/a&gt; for all creators, so it’s probably a matter of time before Instagram nudges its cap even further. Instagram has yet to share in detail how well Reels is doing, but Instagram’s leader, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast"&gt;Adam Mosseri, said in January&lt;/a&gt; that “we have to be honest that TikTok is ahead.” For what it’s worth, I saw a ripped Instagram Reels video on TikTok for the first time recently, so that’s something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Olympic athletes are competing on an urban heat island</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Land surface temperatures in Tokyo show that it’s an urban heat island." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ICIkLNKorE2S9PydIj_d3tHwJc=/0x33:720x513/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640309/tokyo_oli_2019229_lst.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Land surface temperatures in Tokyo show that it’s an urban heat island. | NASA Earth Observatory images by&amp;nbsp;Joshua Stevens, using Landsat data from the&amp;nbsp;U.S. Geological Survey.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OFU5RK"&gt;Nearly unbearable heat and humidity have made competing at the Tokyo Olympics rough — but the urban sprawl of the city is making things even worse. An insidious phenomenon called the “&lt;a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/urban-heat-islands"&gt;urban heat island effect&lt;/a&gt;” shows up in stark temperature maps of the area put together by NASA. Because Tokyo is an urban heat island, it traps heat, making conditions worse for athletes and residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ5Q92"&gt;The forecast is bad enough on its own. This could be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583913/summer-olympics-danger-zone-extreme-heat-tokyo"&gt;hottest Olympic games on record&lt;/a&gt;. Air temperatures have already hit 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit) since the start of the games. Temperatures will dip a little bit today as a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-seemingly-cursed-tokyo-olympics-are-now-in-the-path-1847359708"&gt;tropical storm rolls by&lt;/a&gt; — but once that passes, the mercury is &lt;a href="https://www.data.jma.go.jp/tokyo2020/#lang=eng"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to climb back up to sweltering temperatures throughout the rest of the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DXHaQx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tokyo’s asphalt and big buildings trap heat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8pw7LP"&gt;Compounding the problem, Tokyo’s asphalt and big buildings trap heat. That can make cities &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/learn-about-heat-islands"&gt;several degrees warmer than nearby areas&lt;/a&gt; with less urban development and more greenery. (Plants can cool a neighborhood down &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands"&gt;through evapotranspiration&lt;/a&gt;, a process similar to how sweat helps a person cool down.) So big cities like Tokyo essentially become “heat islands” surrounded by cooler neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLLTmZ"&gt;Scientists can see this from space. NASA’s satellites specifically tracked &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps/MOD_LSTD_M"&gt;land surface temperatures&lt;/a&gt;, which can show how dark, impervious surfaces in cities hold on to heat. They also re-emit that heat, and that warmth can actually &lt;a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-slstr/applications/land-monitoring/land-surface-temperature"&gt;influence the weather&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UC9liS"&gt;The images below show how much hotter Tokyo is compared to forested areas. NASA took the images in August 2019, on a day with similar weather to what athletes are enduring during the Olympics. The agency wasn’t able to get more recent images because of cloud cover this summer (the dark blue patch on the map of land surface temperatures is a cloud), but NASA says the change from cooler rural areas to the hotter city depicted on the map should be the same this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B2zipx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10671974"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llegLY"&gt;Athletes can even feel the urban heat island effect on a more micro level. “It’s very hot but also humid. The hardcourts absorb the heat, it stays trapped in there,” tennis player Novak Djokovic said on July 24th, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/tennis-swiatek-makes-quick-start-tokyo-heat-takes-toll-2021-07-24/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Archer Svetlana Gomboeva was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./lifestyle/sports/olympics-archery-russian-archer-passes-out-under-tokyos-scorching-heat-2021-07-23/"&gt;treated for heat exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; the day before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tB4rhF"&gt;Climate change makes the urban heat island effect worse, NASA points out in its &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148616/heating-up-in-tokyo"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the satellite imagery. Since 1900, temperatures in Tokyo have risen by roughly 2.86 degrees Celsius (5.14 degrees Fahrenheit). That’s almost three times as high as the global average for warming, NASA says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Pharma Bro’ Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang Clan album sold by US government</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jury Deliberations Continue In Martin Shkreli Securities Fraud Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsaTcNUPieK5IS2Clm1P3pj3_p4=/0x0:4272x2848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640176/826439368.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DNUzFH"&gt;The sole copy of a Wu-Tang Clan record, forfeited by the infamous “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli, has been sold by the US government, according to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/united-states-sells-unique-wu-tang-clan-album-forfeited-convicted-hedge-fund-manager"&gt;a Justice Department press release&lt;/a&gt; published Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eigLlZ"&gt;Shkreli is currently serving out a seven-year prison sentence issued in August 2017 for securities fraud by a Brooklyn, New York, federal court. As part of his sentencing, he was ordered to forfeit his copy of &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a time in Shaolin&lt;/em&gt;, the sole copy of the record released by the hip-hop group Wu-Tang clan. Prosecutors did not release the name of the buyer or the selling price, citing a confidentiality provision in the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Onx1aj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With today’s sale of this one-of-a-kind album, his payment of the forfeiture is now complete.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TH27QZ"&gt;The proceeds will “be applied to satisfy the outstanding balance owed on the Forfeiture money judgement,” the press release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6BG0P"&gt;“Through the diligent and persistent efforts of this Office and its law enforcement partners, Shkreli has been held accountable and paid the price for lying and stealing from investors to enrich himself,” acting US Attorney Jacquelyn M. Kasulis said in a statement Tuesday. “With today’s sale of this one-of-a-kind album, his payment of the forfeiture is now complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTQD7f"&gt;Shkreli bought the album in 2015 for a reported $2 million at auction. The purchase occurred around the same time that he and his pharmaceuticals company gained national attention for jacking up the price of a widely used HIV medication, Daraprim, by over 5,000 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSl3xo"&gt;Shkreli’s purchase of the album gave him sole control over who could listen to it. He briefly streamed excerpts of the record on Periscope following President Donald Trump’s surprising presidential win in 2016. The record has only been heard publicly when &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/09/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album-donald-trump"&gt;13 minutes of it was played&lt;/a&gt; at the MoMA PS1 in New York in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use TikTok’s Text-to-Speech feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gkonKi3KqqgGlE9ciGkHkOyHWg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69640068/acastro_190402_3308_Guide_TikTok_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JnErBA"&gt;TikTok’s Text-to-Speech is both a great accessibility feature for people with visual and reading impairments and a tool to create enjoyable content. While Text-to-Speech is available on devices like tablets or phones via the operating system, it’s relatively forward-thinking for a social app like TikTok to make it available within the app. Other platforms like Twitter and Facebook don’t make use of this feature. Instagram does &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417837/instagram-captions-sticker-stories-accessibility"&gt;auto-caption&lt;/a&gt; stories but only if someone is already speaking in the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQX4Am"&gt;The feature doesn’t come without controversy, however. TikTok changed the original voice after the actor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452815/tiktok-voice-change-text-to-speech-lawsuit"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming she had never agreed to be featured in the app. The new voice is less of a monotone than the original and seems to be just as popular. Creators use it to narrate their videos, as an accessibility tool, and to have a little fun by seeing what words the bot can (or cannot) pronounce.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4XqDM"&gt;If this is something you’re interested in, here’s how to set it up:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VWh9RI"&gt;Record your video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7iJZag"&gt;When you’ve finished recording, press the Text button at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ail4Ip"&gt;Type what you want to say and press elsewhere on the screen to finish the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2O1Ps7"&gt;Press and hold the text you just typed out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0xmuiz"&gt;Select “Text-to-Speech.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oZNEC8"&gt;Here’s an example of what TikTok’s Text-to-Speech feature sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6gxocX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@blushingbb_slimes/video/6983453871267925254" data-video-id="6983453871267925254" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@blushingbb_slimes" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blushingbb_slimes"&gt;@blushingbb_slimes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Color of ur top + last thing you ate = our next new slime! ✨ What is it?   &lt;a title="texttospeech" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/texttospeech"&gt;#texttospeech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="satisfy" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/satisfy"&gt;#satisfy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fypシ" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp%E3%82%B7"&gt;#fypシ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="good4u" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/good4u"&gt;#good4u&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="oddlysatisfying" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oddlysatisfying"&gt;#oddlysatisfying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foru" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foru"&gt;#foru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="oliviarodrigo" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oliviarodrigo"&gt;#oliviarodrigo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ good 4 u - Olivia Rodrigo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/good-4-u-6961786056861550594"&gt;♬ good 4 u - Olivia Rodrigo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>PAX West backtracks, will require vaccinations or negative COVID tests after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="763Fzr"&gt;PAX West will now require attendees to prove they’ve been &lt;a href="https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/health-and-safety/health-and-safety-information.html"&gt;vaccinated for COVID-19 or received a negative test result&lt;/a&gt; before they’re allowed to enter the convention, organizers &lt;a href="https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/info/news/health-and-safety-update.html"&gt;Penny Arcade and ReedPop announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LMzNw"&gt;ReedPop set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152694/pax-east-west-unplugged-2021-dates-announced"&gt;PAX West 2021’s September 3rd start date in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time, it wasn’t planning on requiring attendees to be vaccinated or prove they were COVID-19-free. The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210623183223/https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/health-and-safety/health-and-safety-information.html"&gt;initial health and safety guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for the event instead focused on the face coverings, social distancing, and the cleaning protocols PAX West would feature when attendees congregated in Seattle. You don’t have to scroll very far through &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pax/status/1407767913105268741?s=20"&gt;PAX’s Twitter replies&lt;/a&gt; to see how fans and potential attendees have responded to the convention’s gung-ho attitude toward holding the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="weNgms"&gt;Besides the risks COVID-19 still poses, including the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/22576904/us-new-covid-cases-rising-again-delta-variant"&gt;growing case numbers among unvaccinated populations&lt;/a&gt;, PAX’s organizers should have known better. Conventions are synonymous with spreading viruses and spreading them quickly. PAX itself is also infamous for &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/09/pax-swine-flu-outbreak-soars-to-nearly-100-cases-of-h1nerd1/"&gt;the “PAX pox” outbreak of swine flu in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCwjRO"&gt;Taking that into account, it seems obvious that attendees would want more rigid safety precautions to be taken if the event were to continue as planned — especially since ReedPop and Penny Arcade ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356451/pax-east-canceled-online-west-unplugged-penny-arcade-reedpop"&gt;canceled PAX East in Boston&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year due to “public health concerns.” Finally taking the extra step to require vaccinations or proof of a negative COVID-19 test result is not being overly cautious at this point. It's being realistic. &lt;/p&gt;
