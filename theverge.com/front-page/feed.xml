    <title>The ThinkPad X12 Detachable is Lenovo’s latest take on the Surface Pro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A convertible laptop for ThinkPad fans&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yrlFAz"&gt;You could line up most ThinkPad models of the past few years and the average laptop buyer might have difficulty telling the difference between them. Lenovo has the look, feel, and features of its premium business line down to a science, and it has attracted a devoted base of fans in doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R46m9P"&gt;Over the past year, Lenovo has made several attempts to move the ThinkPad package into less traditional, more portable form factors, from the razor-thin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt; to the pricey but groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;. With the ThinkPad X12 Detachable, the company is once again taking direct aim at Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; line. As you probably figured out from its name, the X12 Detachable is a ThinkPad-branded and ThinkPad-looking 12.3-inch Windows tablet with a detachable keyboard deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaUvoV"&gt;Once you’re aware of that information, there’s not much about the X12 Detachable that will surprise you. It has many of the same strengths that its ThinkPad siblings do, including the camera shutter, the discrete clickers, the keyboard nub, and the black-and-red color scheme that ThinkPad fans will know and love. It also comes with some unique drawbacks that are inherent to its form factor — small screen, shallow keyboard, limited ports, and so on. But if you’re in the market for a detachable PC with business features and strong specs, there’s no reason the X12 Detachable shouldn’t be on your list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkqFqE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10438451"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Ui1IfO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10438471"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0KTBfc"&gt;Buying a portable, detachable machine sometimes means compromising on specs and performance, but that’s certainly not the case here. The X12 Detachable comes with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and runs Windows 10 Pro. The base model has an MSRP of $1,819 but is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x%2FX12-Detachable-G1%2Fp%2F22TPX12X2D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22376272%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; at $1,091. (This is just how Lenovo does their pricing — don’t think about it too hard.) It comes with a Core i3-1110G4, 8GB of RAM (soldered), and 256GB of storage. I’m testing a more expensive Core i5 model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, which is currently listed at $1,331.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61cdoD"&gt;The most comparable Surface Pro 7 Plus models are currently listed at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7-for-Business%2F8P43N3K93409%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-w1b%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$849.99&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7-for-Business%2F8P43N3K93409%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-w1b%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Those prices are deceptive, however, because all of the X12 Detachable models currently listed on Lenovo’s site include a stylus and keyboard cover in the box; you have to buy them separately for the Surface Pro 7 Plus, and they add at least an extra $99.99 and $97.49 to the price. That means my X12 model is actually a couple hundred bucks less expensive than the most comparable Surface Pro (which also has less storage).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROrqCM"&gt;The Core i5-1130G7 in my test unit offers the various amenities of the 11th Gen line, including Intel’s powerful Xe integrated graphics and support for Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 6. Using it was a good, smooth experience: I can’t imagine that anyone using the X12 for standard business work with Chrome tabs, streaming, Zoom calls, and the like will encounter any performance issues. The ThinkPad’s fan was consistently running during my use, but it wasn’t loud enough to be bothersome, and the device never heated up.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ThinkPad X12 Detachable kickstand from the left up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btXqHXsJvqjuF2kL_9IgK_ukMWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439410/mchin_20190703_4517_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard attaches magnetically — it’s super easy to pop on and off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gogu7a"&gt;This isn’t a laptop you’d want to use for any kind of heavy gaming, but the Iris Xe graphics can lend a hand with lighter creative work. I used the device to process and lightly edit a batch of photos, and while it wasn’t the snappiest experience I’ve ever had, it was workable for my amateur needs. Anyone who does professional graphic work should consider a system with a GPU, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYWnkR"&gt;The X12’s keyboard and pen are both fine, and among the better accessories I’ve used with detachable PCs. The stylus, which lives in a handy loop on the right side of the keyboard deck, didn’t give me any problems and has two buttons that you can map to your taste in Lenovo’s Pen Settings software. The keys are a bit cramped and flat, as is often the case with folio keyboards, but typing was a comfortable experience overall. They’re also backlit, which you don’t see on every detachable keyboard.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SC0pMf"&gt;The touchpad is a bit small (I often hit the clickers while scrolling) and not the smoothest around, but that’s also par for the course with this sort of device. If the touchpad isn’t your thing, you can use the TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad logo on the bottom right corner of the ThinkPad X12 Detachable keyboard deck." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5HUsjlTYC5pPmxnmqwTVljKCmd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439411/mchin_20190703_4517_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a bit of a hassle to get the pen in and out of the loop, but I was never worried about losing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detachable keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fsDht69Y3TRfR9_XvQahb7lJcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439412/mchin_20190703_4517_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fn + Space toggles the backlighting. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xZ1vxl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10441919"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFyVRR"&gt;One other part of the chassis worth calling out is the 1920 x 1280 display. Like the Surface Pro line, the X12 has a 3:2 aspect ratio, which is my favorite aspect ratio (yes, I have a favorite). It’s much roomier than a traditional 16:9 display, providing noticeably more vertical space. The top and side bezels are chunky, which may put some people off, but that’s understandable since the device is also meant to function regularly as a tablet (and you need something to hold).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez6IIl"&gt;The panel itself is also quite nice. It gets decently bright, maxing out at 380 nits in my testing, which should be enough for use outdoors and in other bright settings (provided that you’re not doing creative work). It covers 73 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum, which is on par with what we’ve seen from the &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Videos and webpages all looked great, with bright colors and not too much glare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ah04Q"&gt;The X12 has a number of modern security features, which will mostly be of interest to business customers. There’s a match-on-chip fingerprint reader, which enables all enrollment, storage, and authentication to happen within the sensor itself, as well as a dTPM 2.0 chip and Lenovo’s self-healing BIOS, which Lenovo guarantees “will recover and self-heal when corrupted or maliciously attacked.” Like previous ThinkPads, the X12 also has an IR camera that supports Windows Hello facial recognition and includes a physical shutter to block it for privacy. I will note that the shutter is a bit small and difficult to swap back and forth, even with my tiny fingers. (There’s also no shutter for the rear-facing camera.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detachable seen from the back, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sj0Wty3ALriBT_MvpIXN0RsGx-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439413/mchin_20190703_4517_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The kickstand is quite sturdy and doesn’t slide at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1yIEa"&gt;One area where Lenovo is lagging behind Microsoft is upgradeability. The Surface Pro 7 Plus comes with a removable SSD that’s easy to access. The X12’s SSD is very difficult to get at, and doing so would likely void its warranty, per analysis from the experts at &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This likely will not be a deciding factor for most consumers but could be an important consideration for some business users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnCrr5"&gt;The X12 Detachable has a fairly small 42Wh battery. So I was pleasantly surprised to see how long it lasted — especially since the X1 Fold, the last ThinkPad-branded tablet I reviewed, averaged under five hours to a charge. With the screen around 200 nits of brightness, using the X12 as my daily driver for Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, Zoom calls, and the like, I averaged around seven hours and 50 minutes to a charge. This is right around what my colleague Tom Warren got out of the Surface Pro 7 Plus, and it means you’ll get close to a full day out of the X12 if your workload is similar to mine.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awNGKR"&gt;I think Lenovo’s done what it set out to do with the ThinkPad X12 Detachable. The device makes a clear case for itself as a system with the performance, build quality, and business features of a ThinkPad in a uniquely portable and versatile form factor. Its areas of weakness aren’t disasters, and they’re not areas where other detachables do much better. And it comes with some unique benefits, including Lenovo’s suite of business features and the bundled keyboard and stylus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XfyjAR"&gt;When comparing the X12 to the Surface Pro 7 Plus, the latter factor is what really seals the deal for me. The merits of the two laptops’ respective enterprise features and upgradability benefits will likely vary between companies. But for a consumer like me, the fact that the accessories you need are bundled into the X12’s price makes it a significantly better deal than its Microsoft competitor without too many drawbacks. And if you’re a ThinkPad fan who’s been hoping for a capable detachable with all your favorite features, your wish has certainly come true. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This 5TB Western Digital hard drive will store a lot of PS5 games for $100</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ccYo8euYsZlS8dowb1Hjwee50ik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118259/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nllXU6"&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381494/sony-ps5-april-update-games-external-usb-storage-social-features"&gt;an update to the PS5 will allow you to store&lt;/a&gt; — but not play — next-gen games on a portable USB hard drive. Previously, the console only let you store and play PS4 games from external storage. If you’re someone who doesn’t want to keep re-downloading huge PS5 games (especially if you have an internet data cap), but instead would rather just plug in a drive and transfer them locally, there are a couple of hard drive deals worth checking out today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5ba7D"&gt;At Newegg, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmodel-wdba3a0050bbk-wesn-5tb%2Fp%2FN82E16822234385" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Western Digital’s 5TB Black hard drive&lt;/a&gt; is $100 when you put in the offer code &lt;strong&gt;93XQU39 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. It’s normally $150. This model won’t be nearly as fast at transferring files as an SSD, but if having a massive amount of storage trumps speed, this should be a good fit for the PS5, as well as the Xbox Series X / S consoles, or for PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5TTNoy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10443810"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="foKzT9"&gt;For something a little smaller, both in terms of physical size and storage capacity, check out Western Digital’s 2TB Easystore hard drive. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737656464037927504#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $57 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost half off its original price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XW0DSe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9511198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Op7I1y"&gt;It’s been a few days since I gushed about how good this $100 off deal is on LG’s UltraGear QHD gaming monitor. You can still get this 27-inch IPS monitor with G-Sync compatibility, a 144Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time for $297 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLD2QXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381530%2Fwestern-digital-hard-drive-ps5-games-xbox-lg-gaming-monitor-mothers-day-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="hZ3WJs"&gt;Mother’s Day is coming up on May 9th, and if you haven’t purchased anything for mom (much less thought about it, given how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22167586/pandemic-time-perception-2020-covid" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;time during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has felt weird), we’re going to help you out.

    <title>Nintendo is releasing a bright blue Switch Lite in May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61plYWxVNUjoT6PkEo4AoRWoe58=/0x175:2149x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118257/Ey2xDXCWgAEIka8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="phRsD8"&gt;Nintendo has announced a new color for its portable-only Switch Lite. The new hue is “blue,” which looks &lt;em&gt;pretty close&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://media.gamestop.com/i/gamestop/10134015/Nintendo-Game-Boy-Pocket-Blue?%24zoom%24"&gt;Game Boy’s “pocket blue”&lt;/a&gt; color variant. The new color could also be inspired by Pantone’s decision to name “classic blue” the &lt;a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/pantone-color-of-the-year-2020"&gt;Color of the Year for 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgA90N"&gt;Blue joins the other four variants available in the Switch Lite lineup: gray, turquoise, yellow, and coral, the latter of which was the first color announced in the product’s release since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite debuted in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the regular Nintendo Switch, which is a hybrid console that can be played on the go or docked and paired with a larger screen, the Switch Lite is designed for handheld-only gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JV9Qxz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10443883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PjYU1V"&gt;The blue Switch Lite will be available on May 21st, the same day as Nintendo’s upcoming adventure game &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/17/22288101/miitopia-nintendo-switch-direct-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miitopia&lt;/em&gt; launches on the Switch&lt;/a&gt;. And just like the other four colors in the Switch Lite portfolio, the blue Switch Lite will be priced at $199.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Zero Dawn’s Aloy is coming to Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Go0Qi2P_7K9KRqbrQxtfUh8EQ9Q=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118221/Ey2xMmAWEAEiOCA.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pXE3ll"&gt;Aloy, star of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14665114/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4"&gt;Sony’s 2017 open-world hit &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/13/aloy-arrives-in-fortnite-as-the-latest-member-of-the-gaming-legends-series/"&gt;soon be dropping&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s battle royale island. The character will be available in the game’s item shop starting on April 15th, with a bundle that includes cosmetics like a Glinthawk glider. Given that &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; takes place in a world that’s both sci-fi and prehistoric, Aloy should feel right at home in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current “Primal” season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r7mxEk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"No brand is safe from Fortnite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0s44G"&gt;She also joins an increasingly large lineup of licensed characters in Epic’s battle royale, which includes other notable gaming characters like Master Chief, Kratos, and — most recently — Lara Croft. In fact, after Aloy is available, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will be getting a limited time duos mode focused on the stars of &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. “At your disposal will only be the bow for Aloy and dual pistols for Lara — keep an eye out for wildlife and master your crafting skills to upgrade your weapons,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/13/aloy-arrives-in-fortnite-as-the-latest-member-of-the-gaming-legends-series/"&gt;Sony wrote in a blog post announcing the mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4q8dz"&gt;Outside of new characters, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; also got a notable update today introducing off-road tires so you can drive across more of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is poisoning its reputation with AI researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzxx5673Rjngs3acpS-QRdbUqhQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118192/acastro_210412_4523_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The firing of top Google AI ethics researchers has created a significant backlash&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XHnZUS"&gt;Google has worked for years to position itself as a responsible steward of AI. Its research lab hires respected academics, publishes groundbreaking papers, and steers the agenda at the field’s biggest conferences. But now its reputation has been badly, perhaps irreversibly damaged, just as the company is struggling to put a politically palatable face on its empire of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7S3ykJ"&gt;The company’s decision to fire Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell — two of its top AI ethics researchers, who happened to be examining the downsides of technology integral to Google’s search products — has triggered waves of protest. Academics have registered their discontent in various ways. Two &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/departures-2-google-ai-researchers-spur-fallout/"&gt;backed out&lt;/a&gt; of a Google research workshop, a third &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/24/tech/google-ai-ethics-reputation"&gt;turned down&lt;/a&gt; a $60,000 grant from the company, and a fourth &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vj_chidambaram/status/1370449088400011272?s=20"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; not to accept its funding in the future. Two engineers quit the company in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/04/google-timnit-gebru-ai-engineers-quit"&gt;protest of Gebru’s treatment&lt;/a&gt; and just last week, one of Google’s top AI employees, a research manager named Samy Bengio who oversaw hundreds of workers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370372/google-research-manager-resigns-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt;. (Bengio did not mention the firings in an email announcing his resignation but earlier said he was “&lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&amp;amp;id=100002932057665&amp;amp;comment_id=3470470943060607&amp;amp;notif_t=mentions_comment&amp;amp;notif_id=1607192244022022&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;stunned&lt;/a&gt;” by what happened to Gebru.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UEkken"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It worries me that they’ve shown a willingness to suppress science”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p19jNt"&gt;“Not only does it make me deeply question the commitment to ethics and diversity inside the company,” Scott Niekum, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who works on robotics and machine learning, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “But it worries me that they’ve shown a willingness to suppress science that doesn’t align with their business interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fesSsw"&gt;“It definitely hurts their credibility in the fairness and AI ethics space,” says Deb Raji, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation who works on AI accountability. “I don’t think the machine learning community has been very open about conflicts of interest due to industry participation in research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIUPIG"&gt;Niekum and Raji, along with many others inside and outside of Google, were shocked by what happened to Gebru and Mitchell, co-leads of the company’s Ethical AI team. Gebru was fired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; after arguments with managers over a research paper she co-authored with Mitchell and others. (Google disputes this account and &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Gebru resigned.) Mitchell was fired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; after searching her email for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. The paper in question &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155985/paper-timnit-gebru-fired-google-large-language-models-search-ai"&gt;examined problems&lt;/a&gt; in large-scale AI language models — technology that now underpins Google’s lucrative search business — and the firings have led to protest as well as accusations that the company is suppressing research. After Gebru was ousted in December, a &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; declaring solidarity with her and criticizing “unprecedented research censorship” by Google was signed by nearly 2,700 employees and more than 4,300 “academic, industry, and civil society supporters.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CD6SgN"&gt;It’s likely there will be more protest and more resignations, too. After Bengio left the company, Mitchell &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1379514157364510723"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “Resignations coming now bc people started interviewing soon after we were fired,” and that “job offers are just starting now; more resignations are likely.” When asked for comment on these and other issues highlighted in this piece, Google offered only boilerplate responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NwCIiD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHAKEN CONFIDENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="QXOQUE"&gt;One of the employees who &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-resignations-idUSKBN2A4090"&gt;quit the company&lt;/a&gt; in protest earlier this year was David Baker. He started work at Google in 2004 and when he resigned in February, he was director of its Trust &amp;amp; Safety Engineering group. He tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Google’s treatment of Gebru (he left before Mitchell was fired) has seriously shaken his confidence in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6MgGP"&gt;“I was just blindsided to see and hear what happened to Timnit,” Baker told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It broke my heart.” He adds that he didn’t take the decision to resign lightly: he loved his job and refers to his last couple of years at the company as “the happiest days of my life.” But quitting was the least he could do to stand in solidarity with Gebru, he says. “I spent a couple of weeks thinking and talking with my wife and ultimately decided I just couldn’t bring myself to go back to work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya8HMS"&gt;Baker is just one individual who feels let down by Google, but his response shows how the company has damaged its standing even with senior employees. The Trust &amp;amp; Safety team that Baker oversaw works on a range of important safety problems in Google, from tackling spam on Gmail to removing scams from the company’s advertising platform. “We’re behind the scenes on a whole bunch of applications,” as Baker puts it. He adds that although he didn’t work with Gebru or Mitchell personally, members of his team did, learning from them as part of what he calls the “emerging discipline” of AI safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="B4IZ23"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google’s failure in diversity will lead to blindspots in its research”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zEYCa5"&gt;AI safety will grow ever more important to Google as the company integrates machine learning methods ever deeper within its products. Probing the limitations of these systems — not just from a technical perspective but also a social one — was at the heart of Gebru and Mitchell’s work. And while it’s in Google’s interests to find weaknesses in its own technology, it seems the company didn’t want to hear everything its employees had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2Fc6K"&gt;Baker says that although he was always reassured by Google’s integrity within the Trust &amp;amp; Safety group (“We were very focused on what was right for the user, it was not about what was best for the brand”) the treatment of Gebru has made him doubt whether the company is always able to live up to its best intentions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44CwtK"&gt;“I think it definitely calls into question whether Google can be trusted to honestly question the ethical applications of its technology,” says Baker. “And Google’s failure in diversity will lead to blindspots in its research. The reality is that Google is not a place where folks from all backgrounds can thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="HHUWpZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPRESSING SCIENCE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="D07U1x"&gt;Researchers and academics &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to for this story highlighted two distinct but connected concerns with Google’s behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwcIQM"&gt;The first is the treatment of Gebru and Mitchell as individuals and what that says about the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion as an employer. Google has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/04/google-hbcu-recruiting/"&gt;well-documented problems&lt;/a&gt; with hiring and retaining minority talent, and this is another example of its failures. The second touches on broader questions about the trustworthiness of the company’s AI research and whether the company can fairly examine the potential harms of its technology. In the case of Gebru and Mitchell’s work, that means the damage posed by large-scale language models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuxL9T"&gt;All those interviewed for this story stressed that they didn’t doubt the integrity of individual Google researchers, but were worried that the company’s internal structures — including its review process of papers — were subtly warping their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrYSXJ"&gt;“I trust that things they are publishing are correct but I don’t trust that they’re not censored,” Hadas Kress-Gazit, a professor of robotics at Cornell who boycotted a Google workshop along with Scott, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’ll be the truth but not the whole truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6e5r6M"&gt;One of the ways Google’s research is shaped to fit corporate interests is through the company’s internal review process. Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research-focus-idUSKBN28X1CB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google had created a new level of review for “sensitive topics” in 2020. If researchers are writing about topics like sentiment analysis, facial recognition, the categorization of gender, race, or politics, they have to consult with Google’s PR team and legal advisors who will look over their work and suggest changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIjth3"&gt;Internal correspondence cited by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; includes feedback in which a senior Google manager told a paper’s author to “take great care to strike a positive tone.” Another paper was edited to remove all references to Google’s products, and another to remove mentions of legal risks associated with new research — including risks to users’ personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SimsMe"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google said: “Our research review process engages a wide range of subject matter experts from across the Research org and Google overall, including social scientists, ethicists, policy and privacy advisors, and human rights specialists, and has helped improve many of our publications and research applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CyrgQ5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’re getting into a serious problem of censorship.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FudSpE"&gt;But as Mitchell told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; last year (when she was still employed by Google): “If we are researching the appropriate thing given our expertise, and we are not permitted to publish that on grounds that are not in line with high-quality peer review, then we’re getting into a serious problem of censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keUXOU"&gt;Mitchell’s worries are substantiated by the nature of the paper that led to her and Gebru’s departure. Far from offering a controversial or unexpected appraisal, the research gave a comprehensive overview of existing critiques. One marker of this (and of the research’s thoroughness) is that the paper cited 128 previous publications in its original form — more than &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1335500451530170368?lang=en"&gt;six times the average&lt;/a&gt; for papers published at AI conference NeurIPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6fDwD"&gt;The paper says that, like many algorithms, AI language models have a tendency to regurgitate “both subtle biases and overtly abusive language patterns” found in training data, and that because of the amount of computing power needed to create these models they come with environmental costs. These are not controversial observations, and even critiques of the paper have praised its general arguments. One widely shared evaluation of a finished version of the paper by computer scientist Yoav Goldberg &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/yoavg/9fc9be2f98b47c189a513573d902fb27"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that it “takes one-sided political views” and is overly focused on questions of scale, but adds: “I also agree with and endorse most of the content. This is important stuff, you should read it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b6KCN"&gt;This makes Google’s objections to the paper unusual. The company’s head of AI, Jeff Dean, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the paper “didn’t meet our bar for publication” and “ignored too much relevant research” about how the problems it highlighted might be mitigated. But for many, including employees at Google, these objections rang false. As one researcher at Google Brain Montreal, Nicolas Le Roux, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/le_roux_nicolas/status/1334601960972906496"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter: “My submissions were always checked for disclosure of sensitive material, never for the quality of the literature review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XVOC63"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Black and female researchers have made some of the most powerful critiques of AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7IZOz"&gt;Connected to Google’s treatment of the paper itself is the treatment of Gebru as an individual, and what that says about the company’s attitude toward Black and women researchers. “In environments where these people are dismissed, devalued, or discriminated against, their work — these valid critiques of the field — is discredited and dismissed, too,” says Raji. “Minoritized voices have a harder time vocalizing these critiques even though they’re some of the most important contributions to the space.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QASMY"&gt;This dynamic is not new. Raji gives the example of a 2018 paper called &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212"&gt;Gender Shades&lt;/a&gt; by researcher Joy Buolamwini — a paper now recognized as a landmark critique of gender and racial bias in facial recognition. “Famously, the paper almost didn’t get presented at conference because it was dismissed as too simple,” says Raji. After it was published, Gender Shades had a huge effect on the industry and society at large. It sparked political debates about the utility of facial recognition, prompting companies like Microsoft to reevaluate the accuracy of their technology, and others, like IBM, to drop it altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CecOC"&gt;In other words: it significantly changed the political landscape and the priorities of big tech firms. This is the power and impact that the right paper at the right time can have, and for many people this explains why Google was so keen to shut down Gebru’s criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spl309"&gt;As Raji notes, much of this important work is done by groups who are not treated well by tech firms. She says this dynamic — dismissal of the individual leading to dismissal of their work — was at play with Google’s treatment of Gebru. “It was really easy for them to fire her because they didn’t value the work she was doing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E6nods"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TURNING AWAY FROM TECH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="m3zOAS"&gt;Despite the anger and sadness articulated by many researchers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to, others were more ambivalent about recent incidents. They said it would not affect their willingness to work with Google in future, and noted that interference in research was the price of working in industry labs. Many said they thought the only lasting solution to this problem was better public funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNu7L3"&gt;One AI professor at an American university who’s previously received money from Google to fund research and wished to be anonymous, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he could understand why people wanted to protest the company but said that finding funding in academia would always force researchers to turn to potentially compromising sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yg9PAw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Industry labs will always be swayed by corporate interests, say many researchers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RrtyFT"&gt;“I cannot really define a coherent moral or ethical position that says it is okay to accept money from the Department of Defense but not from Google,” said the professor by email. “Put another way: how can you accept (or avert your gaze from) the atrocities that the DoD commits (across the world and also in terms of HR matters involving its own people), but draw the line at the current case with Google?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNCDBG"&gt;Another researcher, who also wished to be anonymous, noted that working in corporate labs would always come with trade-offs between academic freedom and other perks. They said that Google was not alone in treating research staff callously and pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/11631044/microsoft-shuts-down-silicon-valley-research-lab-amid-broader-layoffs"&gt;Microsoft’s sudden decision in 2014&lt;/a&gt; to shut down an entire Silicon Valley lab, firing more than 50 leading computer scientists with little warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oceZaD"&gt;By some measures, though, Google is a special case and wields outsize influence in the field of AI in a way that other companies have not in the past. Firstly, Google happens to have in abundance the two resources that have powered AI’s ascendance in recent years: abundant computing power and data. Secondly, the company has stated time and time again that AI is crucial to future profitability. This means it’s directly invested in the field in a way that doesn’t compare to its funding of, say, computational neuroscience. It’s this combination of self-interest and technological advantage that gives it the ability and motivation to direct, to some degree, the parameters of academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0xcmE"&gt;“They have this massive influence because of the combination of money they’re putting into research, [the] media influence they wield, and their enormous presence in terms of papers published and reviewers in the system,” says Niekum. He adds, though, that this criticism could be applied to other big tech companies just easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAG4cZ"&gt;Whatever the context of Google’s involvement in AI research, it’s clear that the company has hurt its reputation significantly with its treatment of Gebru and Mitchell. Calculating what effect incidents like these will have on a company in the long run is impossible, but in the short term Google has eroded trust in its AI work and its ability to support minority voices. Accusations of self-censorship will also undermine claims that it can regulate its own technology. If Google can’t be trusted to examine the shortcomings of its own AI tools, does the government need to take a closer look at their workings? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u83s1A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google needs to do much more to win back many researchers’ trust&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iZ6Anu"&gt;All the same, those boycotting Google workshops and refusing its money know that their actions are more symbolic than anything else. “Compared to the number of people who are collaborating with Google and the number of academics who have part time appointments at Google, it’s a drop in the ocean,” says Kress-Gazit. They’re still determined, though, to press the issue in the hope that Google will make amends. Since the firing of Gebru and Mitchell, the company has appointed a new employee, Marian Croak, to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/"&gt;oversee its Responsible AI initiatives&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html"&gt;tweaked&lt;/a&gt; its review process for papers (but offered no details about what has changed or why). For those angry with the firm, it needs to do much more, including offering real transparency for reviews and apologizing publicly to Gebru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfWCOQ"&gt;And for others, it’s too late altogether. Raji, who is close to Gebru, says that as a result of watching how Google treated her friend over last few months, she’s changed her mind about going to work in industry and decided to pursue a career in academia instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZZzey"&gt;“Before this, I had a lot more faith in what could happen with industry research on these AI ethics issues,” she says. “This whole situation shows that within industry there’s a lot of cultural dynamics still at play and you’re still beholden to leadership caring about these issues. As a minority woman, you’re going to be disadvantaged and disrespected in certain ways. And I’m just not ready for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z9tGfU"&gt;That’s one talented researcher the tech industry has lost. It won’t be the last. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now ask Alexa to download Xbox Game Pass games</title>

  &lt;p id="6vOsQP"&gt;Amazon is now allowing Xbox owners to download Xbox Game Pass games using Alexa. The feature doesn’t require Alexa users to immediately install a skill, and it can be evoked by saying “Alexa, download [game] from Xbox Game Pass.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVDvYi"&gt;If you’ve already linked Alexa to your Xbox, then the digital assistant will find the game and install it to the linked Xbox automatically. You can also ask Alexa what’s new or popular on Xbox Game Pass and even find out what’s leaving the service soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTekLo"&gt;If you haven’t already linked Alexa to an Xbox, then you’ll be prompted to set up the link when you attempt to download a game with your voice for the first time. This will require the Xbox skill to be installed through the Alexa app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="022T49"&gt;Microsoft is Amazon’s first gaming partner to launch this new Alexa direct-download feature, and it arrives just weeks after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313052/amazon-alexa-app-xbox-new-visual-features"&gt;new Alexa app debuted on Xbox&lt;/a&gt;. The Alexa app on Xbox lets you display emails, the weather, and other visual content, alongside using the digital assistant for voice commands to launch Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBMZ8i"&gt;This new Alexa direct-download option for Xbox Game Pass subscribers will be available to US users today, with additional markets planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now appeal for Facebook’s Oversight Board to take down bad posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uOYZ_28CyEII0mc9XPl_L3NmmeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118039/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZCGnn4"&gt;The Facebook Oversight Board will now allow users &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/267806285017646-the-oversight-board-is-accepting-user-appeals-to-remove-content-from-facebook-and-instagram/"&gt;to appeal for posts to be taken down&lt;/a&gt; from the platform, a significant expansion of the Oversight Board’s scope. For the first six months of the Oversight Board, users could only appeal to have content &lt;em&gt;restored &lt;/em&gt;to the platform after it had been removed by Facebook moderators. Now, the board will also hear appeals for content that Facebook moderators have left in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI4IgZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528364/facebook-oversight-board-content-zuckerberg-policy"&gt;Launched in October&lt;/a&gt;, the Oversight Board is tasked with reviewing Facebook’s moderation decisions, akin to a Supreme Court for Facebook rules. Independent from Facebook at a corporate level, the board will only consider cases once a user has already exhausted their options for review within Facebook itself. If a user wants to escalate the case at that point, they can file an appeal with the Oversight Board in hopes that it will take the case and come to a different decision. The Oversight Board only chooses select cases, however, so there’s no guarantee that an appeal will result in a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oo7Uul"&gt;Posts reviewed by Facebook and left online by its moderators will be eligible for appeal to the Oversight Board. The company has rules barring hate speech, threats, sexual solicitation, misinformation, copyright infringement, and more, but some posts may slip through the cracks or be judged erroneously. The Oversight Board is meant to offer a solution for people who still hope to see problematic content taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxmAUH"&gt;Since launch, the board has posted seven decisions on cases involving hate speech, misinformation, and nudity. On an eighth case, the board declined to publish a ruling after a post was removed by a user. The board is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;reviewing Facebook’s decision to ban then-President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; from its platform in January 2021; there’s no timeline on when a decision will be published.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best thing to do in VR is work out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IK5CWXi8nb6bKYIbIa3m2RH8ydU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118027/VRG_ILLO_4503_Decoder_ChrisMilk_site.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Supernatural founder Chris Milk on the future of fitness &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nuuMPH"&gt;In the pandemic we’ve had to shift our lives to be socially distant — we work remotely, we shop online, and we workout at home. Last year, I signed up for a virtual reality workout app called Supernatural, which runs on the Oculus Quest. Now my wife and I use our Quest 2 almost every day to work out in VR. It feels like we’re leaving the house, the music is great, and the workouts are no joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoEezV"&gt;My guest on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; this week is Chris Milk, founder and CEO of Within — which makes Supernatural. Milk has been making VR experiences for a long time — he’s a true pioneer of the field. Supernatural feels like his biggest hit yet, and it feels like fitness might be the perfect application for VR — the one that makes people go out and buy a VR headset just to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JcgqI"&gt;The basic concept of Supernatural is really simple: you put on the headset, and then use the controllers to swat at targets flying in time to music. It’s kind of like dancing or sword fighting. Dance fighting. Most importantly, Supernatural is &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; — there isn’t a single other VR app that could get my wife to wear the headset, but Supernatural is so compelling we keep our Quest 2 on a charging dock in the bedroom. And almost anyone who’s ever tried Supernatural on our headset has gone out and bought a Quest 2 almost right away. Like I said, it feels like fitness is the perfect application for VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMRWaV"&gt;So, I wanted to know a lot more about Supernatural, how the business works, and what kinds of strange music licensing deals are needed to make it run. Milk and I talked about all of that, but, as you’ll see, he’s a much bigger thinker than that. Really, this conversation has a little bit of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBseQL"&gt;Chris Milk, founder and CEO of Within. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ULTLz"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP6608663613" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZMffB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDDgO7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your company, Within, has an app on the Oculus Quest platform called Supernatural. It’s a workout app. The best way that I can describe it is dance fighting. It is very fun. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAo9ac"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a long journey with VR to get to this app, which I think is one of the killer apps of the platform. I want to talk to you about the whole space, but give me just a quick rundown of Within, and your background in VR, and sort of how you’ve gotten to this point.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR6aLx"&gt;I was speaking to my mom recently and she reminded me, as a kid, I was obsessed with skiing, magic, and music videos. All of them in a strange way have ended up in what I’m doing today, but especially so in Supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0AkLo"&gt;In more recent times, I’ve spent most of my career exploring how we might use new technologies to create more meaningful human experiences, ideally, more life-changing human experiences. Most of them have been centered around storytelling, entertainment, music, art, and thinking about what we can make that would be impossible to make in the legacy artistic mediums that we were born with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8jyb1"&gt;My career, I started in directing music videos. I worked with Kanye, Arcade Fire, Johnny Cash, U2, many others; moved into interactive music videos on the web as sort of the broadcast medium was transferring from television to the internet, and music videos basically staying the same, just being broadcast to YouTube instead of MTV. I took that opportunity of this new toolset to explore what kind of things I could do with music videos, if I used the tools that the format now offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeJyLI"&gt;That then led to immersive digital installations in museums. And that led to early in, I think it was 2012, I started experimenting and thinking about VR. In 2013, I was working on my first movie and pitching, at the same time, a startup, neither of which I had much idea of what I was doing on either front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXOZkA"&gt;Then, I think 2014, I got a greenlight feature film starring Nick Nolte, incredible actor, dream project. Still one of the best unproduced scripts out there and I’ve been developing it for probably three years. Ben Horowitz said that Andreessen Horowitz would lead the seed round of the company, and I promptly stepped off the movie and founded the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKoroK"&gt;In the early years, we were trying to crack immersive entertainment, essentially figure out what comes after film and television, empowered by the technology of VR. The longer story there is that we were trying to solve a problem that not many people had at all, but through a number of different discoveries, we realized we could use immersive entertainment to solve a different problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkWpWx"&gt;One that my co-founder and I, Aaron, both had, which was that we needed to exercise but we vigorously disliked the act of actually doing so. We sort of thought deeply about what it would take to love rather than loathe exercise. We thought we could fill a gap in the marketplace that we saw. We knew it was there because we were personally sitting right in the middle of it. We quietly pivoted the company in 2018 and we went back into stealth mode. We built Supernatural over the course of two years. We released it in April of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6hO3P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this the vision for where you thought you would be with VR? Your background is making music videos and feature films and big creative projects. And Supernatural just feels like a company that will scale the way a regular company scales.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEnfA7"&gt;That’s a great question with a complex answer. I think we were looking at this new technology and thinking as we have most new technologies. I mean, when I say we, primarily Aaron Koblin, my co-founder, and I, who have been working together for a lot longer than we’ve had this company. He used to be at the Google Creative Lab, and I was an independent music video director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXcfVb"&gt;Those aforementioned interactive music videos, most of them were him and I collaborating, him at Google and me sort of as an independent artist and director, and really thinking about what can these new technologies offer that we can’t do with what is currently out there? And when you think about the mediums and the art forms that we love, like cinema and television, radio, these art forms, these artistic mediums came forth through technological innovation, right? It wasn’t Orson Welles tinkering around in his shop trying to figure out how to make a movie, that he invented cinema. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZjfZeE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUReUu"&gt;The technology of cinema was invented by scientists and inventors and technicians. And it was artists that took those technological innovations and figured out how to make, essentially, meaningful human experiences with them. So those technologies, because we’re on an exponential timeline of technological innovation, those kind of innovations previously came out every few decades or so. Now our working premise is that they’re coming out every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrxcIf"&gt;We’re exploring these new technologies and thinking about what could be the next great medium, what comes after cinema, what comes after television. That’s what a lot of our explorations have been around, utilizing technologies on the internet like personalization and interactivity, and then moving into more immersive technologies like motion capture and virtual reality and augmented reality, and just thinking hard: where can these technologies take us as a species? Where can they take us from an artistic standpoint? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOuEb7"&gt;Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is make something that is meaningful to another human being in the way that other things and these other artistic mediums have resonated with us. Ultimately, we’re trying to make something that is life-changing. That is what great art, what great media, what great things do in your life. I think what we’ve come to learn, though, which is really interesting and we didn’t originally understand, is that you can, that changing someone’s life is hard to do with a movie, it’s hard to do in a music video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJZKM9"&gt;I think we both sort of had lofty ideals of what’s possible, but you’re not going to change someone’s life with the music video that you make. You might change someone’s life on the album. I’ve had my life change from certain albums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlW2rO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0ImXi"&gt;That really speaks to the sort of magical power of music, but I’ve never had my life changed by a movie and I was, much of my life, trying to be a filmmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GOKYC"&gt;I think what’s cool is what we learned through the process of this, that if you can utilize all that same intangible magic of art and storytelling and crafted human experience, but calibrate it for a higher purpose; that rather than just entertainment, calibrate it to health, calibrate it to making your life last longer, making your life better from a day-to-day basis, let you have more energy, let you have a clearer head, let you be stronger. Then, you can actually use the power of art for a different purpose and one that actually does hold that original potential of changing someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLOaQJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s really interesting because you gave this very famous &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_milk_how_virtual_reality_can_create_the_ultimate_empathy_machine?language=en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TED talk in 2015 saying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, VR was an empathy machine. I think that was really influential for a lot of people. Even my first experience using VR headsets for your products was, we’re going to take you to a different place and you’re going to feel this experience that somebody else feels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9qJ5h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural is very much an experience about yourself, and I hear what you’re saying; it makes sense that you’re an artist, you’re creative, you’re able to think about how people will feel emotionally and how you could guide those emotions and use them for Supernatural, but it’s still a very, I mean this as literally as possible, a very self-centered experience. How do you connect those two ideas?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcP4PV"&gt;Yeah, it’s a little bit deceptive when you look at most of the interactive, immersive experiences currently, Supernatural included, are experiences that you’re on your own. That absolutely does not have to be the case. It will not be the case for very much longer when you think about what this technology is. It’s you tapping into a digital format that is connected to the internet, which is connected to anyone else that is also connected to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxHr89"&gt;There haven’t been a lot of things that really strongly utilized the co-presence immersive nature, immersive powers of virtual reality but the small number of experiments and projects that have, are absolutely incredible. The sense of presence that you can feel with another person and the human connectivity that you can experience with another person, especially another person that you have a relationship with, that you’re already close to and familiar with, is unlike anything else that exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eoNnO"&gt;I mean, just to give you a couple of examples, there’s a mini-golf game on the Oculus headset and I routinely play mini-golf on the weekend with my best friend in San Francisco,I  haven’t seen in ages. Growing up in junior high and high school, we used to work at a mini-golf range, coincidentally, together. The experience of wandering around this magical VR mini-golf range as we just sort of casually talk about what’s happening with us recently while playing mini-golf is totally the experience that we would have if we were actually together, and you get that sense of human connectivity that you wouldn’t get over a Zoom, you wouldn’t get over a phone call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ot3TDk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I ask every CEO and executive who comes on the show, what is your decision-making framework? You’re building something entirely new, how do you evaluate and prioritize what to do? How do you make decisions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXtVpG"&gt;Yeah, good question. I mean, of course, every decision is different and has a multitude of different factors and variables that you’re considering, but I think on the highest level the way we think about it is, we are humans and we are using technology to make things for other humans. And that technology is just a tool, and not to get so caught up in the technology, but really think about what is the end experience for that member and what is going to matter to them? What’s going to resonate with them? What’s going to make their life better? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nJRab"&gt;We have this metric that is sort of a unique metric, I’m guessing. We call it JAW. It’s J-A-W. It stands for joy, awe and wonder. And If there’s a decision we’re trying to make about a new feature or a new direction of the product or even a different layout of the menu, we’ve think about will this bring joy, awe or wonder to the experience for that member experiencing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LstfX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things about Supernatural that strikes me is that it’s very similar to the first hit app on the Quest, Beat Saber. What is your relationship to Beat Saber and the other apps like that? Because the first time I ever put on a VR headset, someone’s like, “You’ve got to play Beat Saber.” Obviously Supernatural builds on the mechanic. You’ve extended it, but how do you see that relationship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMR2jq"&gt;I think we’re utilizing a mechanic that goes all the way back to Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero. There’s been many VR rhythm apps. I mean, the first one that we were looking at was actually Audioshield, which was a great workout in and of itself. I mean, moving your body to music, that you are striking things out of the air, is the rhythm game paradigm of virtual reality. It’s hugely effective if you’re going to try to get someone to have fun and have a cardio activity at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9sIO3"&gt;What we did with Supernatural was, we saw that works well. That is fun, but how do we build it from the ground up as a legitimate fitness system? Obviously, we have coaches. Our movements are designed to be healthy over repetitive use over long periods of time. We work with lots of different experts to make sure of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVgACm"&gt;Part of the education of discovery that we had, also, as a journey with the company was, in the earlier years, we were building a lot of these interactive music experiences. We were showing them at film festivals. Most people in the world haven’t seen them because we didn’t release them publicly on the app stores. But we’re building a lot of different sort of music-driven, cohabitated social experiences like we’ve been talking about, working with Pharrell, and OKGo, and Justice, and building these really cool, immersive, music-driven experiences where you’re moving your body and you’re inhabiting crazy, magical experiences. It’s sort of basically the evolution of music videos, going back to the early beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RrZ3f"&gt;What we saw with these experiences, though, as we were showing them at Sundance and Tribeca and South by [Southwest] and all those places was, people were coming out of them sweating profusely — which was the first problem that we had to solve because you’re putting a bunch of people in them in a row — and they were laughing. They were totally filled with joy. They routinely thought that they were in there for a shorter amount of time than they actually were. They’d do something for 15 minutes and think that they were in there for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwHgEV"&gt;I don’t know the last time you were on a treadmill and half an hour seemed like 15 minutes. It’s certainly never happened to me. We thought, in the process of thinking about how we use this technology for this other use case, that definitely went into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfFtCq"&gt;Also, a number of studies around your perception of discomfort is lowered in virtual reality, which is why they’re using it in clinical settings and in childbirth and burn centers and chemotherapy centers. There’s something about your perception being removed from your physical body in space that just makes stuff hurt less, but it also makes it easier to push yourself harder when you’re doing a cardio workout. It does hurt less and yes, it’s part of the fact that you’re basically playing a sport that is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="07DGYL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Fitness is the killer use case for VR. It will be the first driving force of mass adoption through a normal consumer audience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F2yvGS"&gt;There’s a major difference between being in a gym and a coach or instructor saying like, “Okay, we’re going to do 50 squats in a row. Here we go. Ready? One, two.” That experience is totally different than surfing and going into a tube and squatting and holding for 20 seconds while the barrel forms around you, but the physical benefit and activity is the same. You’re never in the tube going, “How long am I going to have to hold the squat for?” You’re just enjoying the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqFCsm"&gt;Taking these things that we learn through the entertainment experiences that we were making, and utilizing the fun mechanic of a beat game construct. Then pulling in all the resources and expertise of people that specialize in human movement and physical training, and then really building a system from the ground up to incorporate all those things for the best, most awesome, fitness experience that you can build in virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG9428"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the headsets for a minute. One of my theses with computers, I hope everyone forgives me, I just have a lot of ideas about computers generally, but computers that you put on your body, it seems like a killer app for all of them, whether it’s headsets or smartwatches or whatever, is health and fitness, right? The Apple Watch became an exponentially successful product when Apple shifted its focus to health and fitness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gNxLg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural is the thing that is getting a lot of people to buy a Quest and strap basically an Android computer on their face every day. Is there another killer app for the headset, for traditional VR headsets, like we have right now, that can drive adoption and get that installed base growing the way that everyone has always told me that it will? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f01rC"&gt;Yeah. I’ll say a couple things. I think what you’re saying is absolutely correct in terms of virtual reality; fitness is the killer use case for VR. It will be the first driving force of mass adoption through a normal consumer audience. Just as an example of what we’re seeing from our membership base, we’re 50/50 split, women and men, where, I think over 60 percent are over 40. This is not what a typical VR demographic looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4X0nY"&gt;The reason for that is, it’s using the technology for a different use case, and one that it works incredibly well for. When you think about going back to the technology of cinema, that was a linear sequence of still frames played one after another, not at first, but after not that long, sync sound went along with it. That technology, though, enabled the birth of cinema, but it also enables television, it also enables a Zoom call, it enables a how-to video that you’re watching on YouTube. It even enables a spreadsheet in Excel, that you’re moving numbers around. That technology of a linear sequence of still frames is what powers most of the things that we deal with on a daily basis on rectangles in our life, which there are many, as you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqfE66"&gt;That’s sort of like a case study, and where does the technology go once it’s used for one thing, and the answer is it essentially goes everywhere. What you’re seeing in virtual reality right now is very much what usually happens. I mean, the first thing being — Chris Dixon talks about it —  all new disruptive technologies first appear as though they are toys. Virtual reality is a perfect example of that, but it’s primarily understood to be a video game system right now. But when you take the technology and you apply it to exercise or wellness as we’re doing, it’s a totally different paradigm and it is one that many people are much more open and willing to adopt the technology, because it solves a problem in their life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bl7L8k"&gt;Most people don’t buy new technologies just because they’re new technology. I do. Most people don’t. Most people buy new technology because it serves a purpose and it solves a problem in their life. You don’t buy a television set because you want a black rectangle on your wall. You buy it because your favorite television show comes through it. The new technology of virtual reality needs not just your favorite television show, but it needs all the other use cases that could be enabled by applying the technology to that use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE1BNA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about Within and Supernatural. How many employees does Within have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c85s8Z"&gt;It depends on if a few of them accepted an offer today, but we’re about 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQJ85Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many of them are focused on Supernatural itself? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFiM3"&gt;All of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcXoJ0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Supernatural, the fitness platform, that’s your entire focus? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPeX7U"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFGLbJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it take to make a Supernatural workout experience? Who is the staff that produces that all at once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QT1Ur5"&gt;There’s really two sides to our business, there’s the technology business and there’s a content business. [On the] technology side; all the multitude of complex systems that you might imagine to make something like an interactive, immersive VR and subscription platform work, from the sexy things like how the balls explode, to the less sexy things like back end account management — all of that requires a large engineering team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9OfNA"&gt;Then, there’s the content side of it. There’s actually a few different pipelines that go into making the content. There’s the coach capture production pipeline, which is shooting the coaches and our 3D capture system that lives in Culver City. I should point out that we are, from a content standpoint, we are producing and launching new content every single day. That’s the flag we planted in the ground. When we launched, we said we’re going to launch a new workout a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlsbyw"&gt;Every morning, as you know, as a member, you open up the app on your iPhone or your Android phone, or you put the headset on, and there’s a new workout that has a new musical theme or sometimes it’s just sort of an overall theme, but it’s new every day. It’s a surprise under the Christmas tree of what the workout of the day is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDmcso"&gt;What goes into the content side of making that, the coach production pipeline, we’re shooting coaches five days a week to release classes, to release workouts every single day. There’s the environment pipeline, which is all the beautiful destinations that you’re finding yourself in, song to song, those are not just a flat 360 photo. That’s actually a 3D model with super high-res images mapped on top of the 3D model. That’s a pipeline that builds those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJlWdF"&gt;There is a mapping pipeline for the layout of the targets that are flying at you that are synced to music. That’s a team of trainers and choreographers that build the patterns of the targets and the placement of them that are synced to the music. We have a map-making tool that we built internally, that the mappers are actually in virtual reality and laying out the targets in space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIHWw4"&gt;They can sort of forward the unit, they can reverse and play and stop and rewind the map over and over again as they physically place the targets in the air to go along with a picture. And they can see where the beats are up in space so they can line up the targets to the beat. That’s a very manual and creative process. It’s not an easy thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV2i3i"&gt;We’re basically, essentially puppeteering your movements through what is essentially dance, to music that you love, and that involves a really talented person that can choreograph those movements. It feels, as you said, like you’re sort of, what was your terminology that you used at the beginning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7KK14"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My wife and I call it dance fighting. I mean you’re holding lightsabers and you’re dancing, so we just got there. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD2Kae"&gt;Yeah. There’s an element of sort of kung fu martial artness to it, but you’re also moving your body in choreographed ways to music. There’s also a hidden element of dance and moving your body to music is just naturally fun. So that’s the beat mapping pipeline and then there’s music curation and overall creative workout construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7smT8X"&gt;Every workout has a theme, has a playlist, has a creative thumbnail, has a creative name, has a description. There’s a creative content team that does all of that as well. We’re programming and thinking about workouts that are months ahead. We really put a lot of thought and care into making each of these workouts. It’s not just thrown together on the day, shoot it live, post it up. There’s a lot of curation and crafting and artistry from that team that really goes into making each one of those workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKHtfg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask what the cost curve is of that, and I’ll make the comparison to Peloton because it is such an easy comparison. Peloton, yeah, they have a bike and they have a software platform, and mostly though, they’re shooting videos of their trainers on a bike pedaling really hard and turning the resistance up and down. There’s some sensors and leaderboard stuff around it that makes that experience feel more interactive, but at the end of the day, it’s people on a bicycle and that’s what’s happening there. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYUimg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are describing a much more costly creative project, right? You had to build a software pipeline to do the choreography and the mapping, you have to build a software pipeline for volumetric 3D models of locations, you presumably have to acquire the photography and the imagery from all those far-flung locations you’re in. It’s just a lot of new things that are either at the top of the cost curve, or you have to invent them, which means you’re going up the cost curve. Do you see that coming down or is that the moat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h5Bspf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t actually look at our competition as a stationary bike. We look at our competition as the couch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E0KFuR"&gt;It’s a little bit of both. The cost does come down as we get better at doing this and building more scalable systems, but it is what it takes to make something like this. By our estimates, the business model does pencil out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bX6pY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s good to hear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3zABz"&gt;Always good to hear, but we also, honestly, we think the market is a lot larger. There is a person that enjoys cardio exercise at home and takes joy from running on a treadmill or pedaling on a stationary bike. I, unfortunately, am not one of those people. By the way, God bless those people, I wish I was one of those people, but I think there’s a lot more people like me out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mx1z49"&gt;I mean, 50 percent of gym memberships go completely unused year to year. That’s people that have actually gotten up and gone to a gym and signed up, and just not used their membership. They just haven’t found the solution that works for them. We don’t actually look at our competition as a stationary bike. We look at our competition as the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1H2JCT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many members do you have right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8e99qy"&gt;That’s a great question. We, of course, don’t broadcast our current membership-based numbers, but what I can say is that our goal for the first year was to have as many members as is reported that a large, well-known, connected fitness service had after their first year. We’re not at our first year yet, but it’s looking like we will have 10 times that number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8cIpm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large, well-known, connected fitness service. Is it the one I keep talking about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tf3sTo"&gt;You can jump to your own conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31MlGV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your churn like? It’s $19 a month. Are people signing up, paying the money and staying there? Are they trying it out and leaving? What does that life cycle look like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awd59u"&gt;Yeah, our churn is low and comparable to other hardware-based connected fitness services. The thing that’s special about Supernatural honestly, is the cost of the hardware is like one-seventh of the cost of a spin cycle. We’re half the cost of a monthly subscription fee. I haven’t measured the volume of a spin cycle versus a VR headset, but probably like one-30th, one-50th the size of the thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8XUfF"&gt;We take up zero floor space. You put it in a drawer when you’re done, disappears, and you throw it in your suitcase and take it wherever you want to go. That’s really a different paradigm. Going back to the last question, I think it’s one that makes it a lot more accessible to a lot more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBxeMZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to ask one more question about the famous connected fitness company. Then, I actually do want to talk about headsets and platforms. Peloton, very famously in a big fight with the music industry, right? They don’t pay the fees the industry wants. They have a point of view about it. The music comes and goes. Peloton users are notoriously kind of angsty about it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG7uGt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural has the music. This year you &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/index.php/articles/business/9538423/vr-fitness-app-supernatural-umg-licensing-deal-impact"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;made a deal with Universal Music Publishing Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and you have similar agreements with other labels, so there is a trove of popular music in the app to workout to. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHW8CT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that, Chris Milk has directed videos with Kanye West, he’s getting a deal? Is that you’ve structured a new kind of deal? Is that a cost that’s going to accelerate as you become more successful? How is that working, because it seems like one of the hardest challenges for all of these services right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71PJRi"&gt;Yeah, it’s definitely, it’s not an easy thing to do as a small startup. I will say that when we started building this, we knew that we needed the best music, that this just was not going to work using needle drop or stock music; that if you’re going to move your body to music, it needs to be music that you love. it needs to be music that you’re familiar with and that you’re passionate about, and it can’t be music that you’ve never heard before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrZQCy"&gt;To do that requires relationships with a huge amount of large entities in the music business. The first thing that I did was call the people that I know, my old friends in the music industry from being a music video director, and said, “Listen, I know others have done this incorrectly. I want to do this right. I want to be a partner to your industry. I think there’s something that’s really special that we could build that is going to require some different type of creative thinking around deal structures and how we think about this platform in comparison to other platforms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyuJR9"&gt;That was on day one, I made those calls. It was a collaboration from the get-go. It was never feign ignorance and beg forgiveness later. It was definitely “We’re going to do this together and we’re going to do it the right way.” When you start working with the amount of music that we’re working with, there’s really not an off-the-shelf tool that allows you to do what you need to do, which involves ingesting the hundreds of thousands of songs from many different sources and keeping track of them and keeping track of the rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5erPk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, are you paying royalty rates based on plays? If I play one playlist versus another, you pay different royalty rates?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIPfOL"&gt;It’s really more complex than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlaXQ0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJ9j1M"&gt;Yeah. We could do a whole show on how music deals work. It’s incredibly complicated and requires an entirely custom backend system to service it, but again, it’s what you have to do if you’re going to create the kind of system that Supernatural is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x34lxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I would compare that to the Spotify business model, where you pay Spotify some amount of money a month, they’ve just allocated some chunk of your subscription fee towards royalty payments, and then they have their own backend to allocate those further. Is that how you think about the $19 a month, that just some percentage of it is allocated towards music royalty payments? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrw2ty"&gt;Yeah, I mean, in the most general terms, when you see a piece of music in a movie, that’s a sync license and when you see music in Spotify or Apple Music, that’s a licensing deal. Every song that you might potentially play, it’s not just a deal with one entity. There might be a multitude of rights holders because you’ve got the record label, but then you also have the publisher, and you have to have both. The publisher, if you have a song that had 12 songwriters on it, you might have 12 different publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHOMfJ"&gt;You’ve got to make sure that every single thing that you’re playing is cleared and there’s nothing that just tells you like, here’s your list of songs that you’re good. It’s really, it’s complex to say the least, and it’s something that it’s taken really years to get to the point where it works as effectively as it does right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfJ9Jd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your license primarily a sync license to make a derivative work on the music or are you just licensing the track?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssmoYk"&gt;What I can say is that we have the rights to hundreds of thousands of songs and that catalogue grows on a regular basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVT2l1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have some sort of like custom deal that you’ve worked out to enable this product? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M55mnB"&gt;I mean, there’s no off-the-shelf deal when it comes to music licensing. Everything is a custom negotiation across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1clVQC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s totally fair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2dFHx"&gt;It is a testament to the sort of openness and creative thinking of the music industry and how it thinks of service like Supernatural. Because it required a lot of creative thinking and constructive deal-making to make this whole thing work for everyone involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc0NvK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you had artists use it? Are they freaking out over it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NanMPT"&gt;Yeah. There’s a few.  There’s a number of artists that have used it. I won’t name anyone specifically, but there’s been artists that I’m friends with that are using this service that I have to notify tomorrow that they’re actually there in the service so they’re not surprised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkxwaW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s amazing. Are you going to do larger programming with artists, having them be coaches, having them talk to people? That seems like a real natural opportunity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osaXCx"&gt;Yeah, I mean, we would love to do more workouts that are specifically curated around specific artists. If you are a musical artist and you’re listening to this, and you’re excited about the future of fitness, get in touch with us. We’d love to do something cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vx99DW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You got to cut me in. We’re talking music, I want a point too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZUFuQ"&gt;Yeah, right now we have a few workouts that are coming in the next couple months that are around specific musical artists. That’s just so cool because you can really go deep into their catalog and you can really tailor the whole experience from the places, the locations where you’re doing the workouts, to the voiceover and the theme and the art around it, specifically to that one artist. That’s something that we’re going into. It’s really exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqaWzO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things about Supernatural that I think is really interesting is that it is very native to VR. It is an authentic product for VR. I have no idea how you would do a Supernatural workout in real life, like dodgeball. It’s a very complicated thing about how it would work in real life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OT0l9"&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ROJkS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That also limits your expansion capability, right? I keep hammering you with the Peloton comparison but Peloton was like, “We made a bike. We made a treadmill.” They’re going to make a rowing machine. They can do weightlifting. How do you expand your range of products when it’s all in the Quest and the Quest literally limits all the things you can do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnlIrk"&gt;Well, I mean, we also have an R&amp;amp;D lab at Within and Supernatural. I can say there’s a hell of a lot more things that we can do that are really compelling in that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7wnsg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See, this is where you announce them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKVwZN"&gt;I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVcxSE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a perfect opportunity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkMrmJ"&gt;Perfect opportunity. I mean, I think that the limitation is really around not the hardware, because the hardware will come. If people have a use case for it and it solves a problem in their life, they’ll buy the hardware. I think the limitation is really having people understand that exercising in virtual reality makes sense. I mean, as I said at the beginning, it’s very hard to describe the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU3RO4"&gt;And I know this because I’ve described it thousands of times now and then had someone, I described it verbally and then they actually try it. Almost 100 percent of the time I describe it and they say, “Okay, I think I got it,” and then they try it and they go, “Yeah, that was not what I was imagining at all. That’s amazing, but not what I was imagining from the way that you describe it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btvzF6"&gt;I’ve sort of made peace with the fact that however I describe it, it’s never going to resonate in the same way as people actually experiencing it. But essentially, it’s a membership-based, full body, fitness and wellness service that utilizes the power of VR to make for a workout that you couldn’t experience otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJLOdx"&gt;The cooler way of describing it is, it’s home exercise. It feels like you’re playing a sport with your best friend while on vacation, but good luck getting anybody to totally imagine what that is going to be like when they put the headset on. But what’s cool is people are trying it and they’re telling other people in their immediate family or friends’ circle or social network circle that it’s working for them, and that is the sort of the network effect of people talking about it that it’s working for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFgVr7"&gt;It is, I understand, a strange thing to imagine. Like when you say a Quest is an Android phone that you strap onto your head, that does not sound like they’re paying for exercise, but when you do it, that’s not the experience that you’re having. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jw6IQ0"&gt;The experience that you’re having is that you’re transported to the most beautiful places on Earth. You’re moving your body in this fun way, swinging bats through the air to hit these targets that are flying at you from 360 degrees along to your favorite music, and there’s like a coach that is your best friend that’s there with you and cheering you on the whole way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsUznV"&gt;That’s a totally different experience and one that you have to try. But I don’t think that we will be limited in the long term by the fact that it sounds counterintuitive, because there’s many things in our life that are also successful businesses that seem counterintuitive when you first hear about them, but then become commonplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxX14M"&gt;If I told you 10 years ago that you are going to hit a button on your phone and a stranger was going to pick you up outside a bar in his personal car and drive you home, that would sound strange and counterintuitive. If I told you that you’re going to rent your second bedroom out to a stranger that just flew in from someplace across the country and it was going to be totally fine, that would sound counterintuitive. There’s many things, at first, that sound counterintuitive but then when you try them you’re like, “Oh, actually, that makes a hell of a lot of sense.” I firmly believe that that’s going to be what happens with virtual reality and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTZCTq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The instructors are your best friends, right? They’re very personable. What we’ve seen with every fitness platform is the instructors become personalities. They go on to have extended personality-based careers in many cases. Is that how you’re thinking of your instructors too? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVZt4v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because the one thing you maybe couldn’t do is, when the pandemic is over, go to a studio and be in the room with one of your instructors doing the workout, which seems, again, the VR workout is great because it’s in VR, but extending it to real life seems challenging in that way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmXWYh"&gt;Yeah, well, I mean, I’ll put it this way; the things that are exercise that you can do in a gym are the things that make sense to physically do in the gym. It’s packing a bunch of people together in a four-walled room with a ceiling and an instructor, that one-to-many broadcast, and you do the things that you can do in that limited amount of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je68FQ"&gt;We’re creating a new reality. We’re not going to duplicate the things that we’re building. Yes, they don’t fit in a four-walled gym and, honestly, I think we’re all better for it. If we can create a reality where you can stand on top of a glacier in Iceland and slam targets with these space bats flying at you while Kendrick Lamar plays from the sky, I’ll take that over 20 people in a cement-walled room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHYtX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhRibs"&gt;But I think that there’s something to dig into here, which is that there’s entertainment and then there’s exercise. By exercise, I mean, specifically home exercise. Entertainment is something that you want to do because you enjoy doing it, right? You watch TV because you enjoy doing it. Exercise, for most of us, we do it for the long-term benefits. Most of us don’t enjoy the act of doing it, which is, as I said, why more than half of gym memberships are paid but don’t get used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67RwoI"&gt;I think what generation one, let’s call it “connected fitness”, has done brilliantly is take the home exercise experience and added a layer of entertainment on top of it. You have a personable coach or instructor that you feel their personality, you want to come back to another class of theirs. You’ve got incredible music and you’ve got the sense of a live feel, but the actual act of what you’re doing, let’s say it’s a virtual spin class, the actual act of pedaling in place is not intrinsically fun on its own. That layer of entertainment acts to distract you from the thing that you’re doing that is not fun on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icCjB5"&gt;I mean, we thought about, what if you could take entertainment and turn it into exercise? Now, that exists in real life. It’s called sports. They take place outside. They require equipment. Sometimes other people then oftentimes travel to other places, like skiing, snowboarding, mountain bike riding, basketball, hiking. These are things that you do that are exercise but you’re not, I mean, you may do them for the exercise benefit of them, but you are also doing them because they are intrinsically fun on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mANz9Z"&gt;It’s very hard to create something, create a modality that is intrinsically fun from an exercise standpoint in your house, just because you have what you’re dealing with in your house, which is a limited amount of space. Mountain biking does not fit in your bedroom. Skiing does not fit in your living room, but what if they could? And that’s what we set out to build, something that was intrinsically fun, intrinsically entertainment, and something you wanted to do over and over again that had the extra benefit of exercise because that’s the thing that makes it easy to keep coming back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DNdD3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I asked about going into the real world in the context of our platform conversation, is it seems like it would be really fun to do Supernatural with another person. It’d be really fun to do it in a class setting, maybe on a beach, and the platform that would enable that would be an AR platform, an augmented reality platform. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxAmNS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those are not quite here yet. There’s lots of prototype E or early versions of those products. The AR versus VR conversation just seems to rage all the time. Is that something that you have a position on? Is it something you’re looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Olw6Oi"&gt;Yeah, I’m very much looking forward to more robust AR systems coming into the market. I think there’s totally room to explore that technology for a similar purpose as well, but I would challenge you a little bit, because yes, it would be cool to be on the beach with your friend doing Supernatural together but it’s also possible, for you and your friend, to be on a beach and doing Supernatural together but you’re both in your bedrooms, in your apartments, and you didn’t have to travel to a beach to do it, which is a lot more realistic and feasible for most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZRDXQ"&gt;Going back to what I was saying before about the potential for shared experiences inside of virtual reality, where the two people inside of the virtual world together are in two completely different geographical locations in real life, is here today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whYdon"&gt;It’s not widely utilized, but what it does allow for is for you to have more meaningful relationships with the people that are geographically removed from you, which, of course, at the moment is sort of everyone’s reality, but imagine rolling out of bed and working out with your best friend every morning that lives in San Diego and you live in San Francisco, and you can do that together and feel like you are on that beach together.	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2cDlb"&gt;That’s totally possible. I would argue that that’s more exciting than having to both travel to a beach to meet each other together because it’s something you can do sometimes, but certainly not like every morning before you go to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDE3Fb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s fair, although I would say a lot of people right now are very eager to travel somewhere with some people. Now, I have to ask you, is that on the roadmap, doing a workout with somebody else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="622X5A"&gt;I would put it like this, the possibilities of what we can do and the ideas for what we’d like to do, like our appetite’s, what’s the expression? Our appetite is bigger than...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbxjhV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your eyes are bigger than your stomach. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSzUfa"&gt;Your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Yeah, I mean, my eyes for what we could do, is limited by just how much you can build if you’re going to build a reliable system that has a lot of people on it. You, of course, have the people that you have, you have the financing that you have, you have the runway that you have, and you prioritize the things that you think will make the most meaningful difference for the people on the platform. That’s certainly what we’re doing and of course, that sort of shared workout experience is something that we’d love to do and is actively being considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqu4y4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for Supernatural? What should people be looking forward to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SVKsF"&gt;What should people be looking forward to? We really want to push the envelope of not just how do we translate existing things that you could do inside of a gym into virtual reality, we want to build things that have the same health benefits, but reimagine them in ways that are fun and invigorating and awe-inspiring and joyful and bring you to another place and sort of another reality of possibility. Like I said, we’re not in a four-walled gym. We can put you anywhere and we can make things that are physically impossible, like explosive cannon balls flying at you from all directions. It’s just not something that we’re going to set up in the parking lot of your local gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DU5ohj"&gt;Really, continuing to follow that thread of how can we make people’s lives better from the experiences that they’re having inside of VR. That’s a big thing for us. We’re not trying to make a world where everybody wakes up and goes into their VR headset and disconnects from society and gets their embryonic fluid Matrix pod and checks out for the day. That’s not what we’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AON70n"&gt;We have an OKR [objective and key results] in the company called MLB, which is “Make Life Better,” and we measure, are we making our members’ lives better outside of VR from the experiences that they’re having inside of Supernatural inside of VR. It’s definitely something that we see happening. We have a Facebook group that a huge amount of our members are on and they are incredible and they’re on a regular basis talking about their experiences publicly. You see it over and over again, people talking about how they haven’t worked out in decades or they’ve never worked out, and they’ve discovered the act of exercise through Supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WWMHQX"&gt;Supernatural sort of unlocked, not just exercise for them, but the idea that they could live a healthy lifestyle. You see people that are posting about how their doctor just told them that they no longer need to take their diabetes medication and this is someone that hasn’t worked out in 40 years but from working out for a few months, they started transforming their physicality and in the course of that, they also started eating healthy because they’re saying to themselves, “Well, if I’m going to work out, I should probably change my diet, too.” And they do. That’s a really awesome, magical thing and I think it speaks to the larger untapped audience that is out there that have chosen no solution rather than one of the current sets of solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s XPS 13 now comes with an OLED touch display option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 seen from the left side on a white background. The screen displays a blue, white, and orange marbled pattern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GFmOrwt6fk4CLHmRnsunZi6e1dw=/0x667:4000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117972/XPS_13_black_open_up_right.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaze upon it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y9vxpg"&gt;Dell has unveiled a new XPS 13 option with an OLED touchscreen that is available for purchase today. The feature will cost an extra $300 over FHD models. (Note: This isn’t a brand-new XPS. It’s just an OLED version of the 9310 that came out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5p6uHk"&gt;&lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;XPS 13 models&lt;/a&gt; start at $999.99 and range as high as $2,199.99, though you can often find them discounted. They can be equipped with up to an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of PCIe SSD storage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thin, light, and OLED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iYn1MQ"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is consistently one of the best 13-inch laptops you can buy. It’s currently number six on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; list, and I had very few complaints in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;most recent review of the device&lt;/a&gt;. It has an excellent, spacious 16:10 display; a solid keyboard and touchpad; great battery life; a compact chassis; and some of the best performance you can find in a 13-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three XPS 13 models in a row on a white background. The far left is in reverse clamshell mode, the middle is in clamshell mode, the far right is in tent mode.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the XPS 13, XPS 13 2-in-1, and XPS 15 2-in-1.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bWpUNe"&gt;You can currently configure the XPS 13 with a 3840 x 2400 touch display, a 1920 x 1200 touch display, or a regular 1920 x 1200 non-touch panel. The new OLED touch model will have 3456 x 2160 resolution (3.5K). Dell says it will reach 400 nits of brightness and will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what Dell calls the “Inspiron Family”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J8HEDt"&gt;Dell also announced a number of new additions to its lower-priced Inspiron line. These include an Inspiron 14 2-in-1 that will support both Intel 11th-Gen and AMD Ryzen 5000 mobile processors, and Inspiron 16 Plus workstation with a 3K 16:10 display. The Inpsiron 14 2-in-1 will be available in North America on May 4th starting at $729; the Inspiron 16 Plus hits shelves on June 3rd starting at $949.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Car Thing debuts as a limited release for selected US users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sqaaL9QydBrJJOYYnx_UxcjfEb0=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69117941/acarman_20210412_4524_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s Car Thing is only being released in limited quantities. | Photo by Ashley Carman / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bjlbEQ"&gt;Spotify’s first gadget has landed. &lt;a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/"&gt;Car Thing&lt;/a&gt;, a Spotify-only, voice-controlled device for the car, is launching today in limited quantities to invited users. It’s a dedicated, Bluetooth-connected device for controlling Spotify without the need for a phone screen, which seems to be meant for people who drive older cars without built-in infotainment systems or phone connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyIpHa"&gt;Before getting to the device details, let’s focus on the basics. Car Thing is only being released as a “limited product launch,” so you can’t buy one outright. Instead, you can sign up for the waitlist and hope Spotify reaches out. It’s only available for US customers, and you have to subscribe to Spotify Premium to qualify. Another thing to know: if you’re chosen to try Car Thing, the device is free, but you have to pay for shipping. Spotify declined to comment on how many units it’d be giving away. The company’s also billing the gadget as an “exploration,” so it’s unclear how serious the team is about the product and its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFRXRu"&gt;The device is shockingly small and lightweight. It has a thin profile and features two prominent buttons on the front, a small one that serves as a back button and a larger knob that lets you interact with whatever’s on-screen. There’s no speaker, so it’s easiest to think of the device as, essentially, a Spotify remote. Yes, you could use your actual phone to play Spotify content, but instead, Spotify is betting that you’ll want voice controls and a dedicated interface to control your audio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWoADpL3fcPfdIfxGRp4RFko9XI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439536/acarman_20210412_4524_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Ashley Carman / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Car Thing requires a power connection to turn on.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="joE5nQ"&gt;I’ve tested Car Thing for a couple days and found the voice controls to be easy to use and relatively intuitive. I drive a 2009 Honda Fit and already keep my phone mounted to the dash for navigation, so I ended up mounting the Car Thing on my vent. This meant I had two bright screens facing me throughout my drive. (I do have a screen built into my car, which you’ll see in photos, but I don’t use it for anything because I prefer Google Maps.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6X6DhP"&gt;The voice controls mostly worked — for some reason it only got tripped up on a Kid Cudi request — but I grew frustrated with the steps it took to control music. When a song that I didn’t like played, it took longer to say, “Hey Spotify, skip” than it would have to just tap the skip button on my phone. I generally felt like I could more efficiently navigate Spotify just by using my phone at stop lights. The device &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; shine, however, when you ask the voice assistant to start a playlist, and it registered those commands easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCivWu"&gt;As for the hardware itself, Car Thing pairs with a phone over Bluetooth. It needs this phone for a data connection, so yes, users will require a decent amount of data to stream. In a press briefing, Spotify noted that right now, there’s no way for users to pull only from their downloaded content, although that functionality could come in the future. Depending on a car’s connectivity, users can either rely on an auxiliary cable for sound or keep their phone paired to their car’s Bluetooth to play audio content over the speakers. The Car Thing doesn’t have a speaker itself, and it’s basically controlling the Spotify app on your phone. It’s a strange setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4KtAF"&gt;The device comes with a 12V adapter into which you’ll plug the provided USB-A to USB-C cable. Car Thing does not include a rechargeable battery and needs to be plugged in at all times. The device also ships with three different mounts: a vent mount, a dashboard mount, and a CD player mount. You can clip a magnetic attachment to these mounts, which then lets you take the Car Thing off easily. (Also worth noting is that the dash mount doesn’t come with a suction cup and instead requires that you stick it to your dash with 3M adhesive backing.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFfou4ECRJysy5XRDzDYq5t89hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439218/carthing1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Car Thing comes with three different mounts.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TueaCX"&gt;Once mounted, you can interact with Car Thing in three ways: through your voice using a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371866/hey-spotify-voice-assistant-hands-free-android-ios-iphone"&gt;“Hey Spotify” command&lt;/a&gt;, through its tactile buttons and knob, or through its touchscreen. It also features four preset buttons on the top of the device, which you can set to specific content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQCo51"&gt;Now that I have a Car Thing, can I see it being a success? I guess it depends on how comfortable people are with a Spotify-owned microphone in their cars and whether they think the device offers a more meaningful experience than their built-in infotainment systems. Because my car is older, it did provide a hands-free interface for music while also adding another screen to my setup. But I also feel uneasy about a Spotify microphone being within earshot of all my conversations. (The device does feature a digital setting to turn the microphone off, probably to address concerns like mine, but still.) Spotify’s &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/"&gt;voice privacy page&lt;/a&gt; says it only records and stores what users say after its “Hey Spotify” wake phrase is spoken, but I still don’t love the idea of an always-listening microphone near me. The privacy page mostly details the company’s interactive voice ads, which I have yet to come across. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7I7saQ"&gt;Broadly, I’d assume people with modern infotainment systems likely won’t need or want a Spotify-only Bluetooth remote, whereas people like me, whose cars are older, might end up wanting to stick with whatever system they’ve already figured out. One thing that Spotify might accomplish with Car Thing, however, is getting users who default to the radio to switch to Spotify instead. It’s clearly making a play for the space with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662060/spotify-your-daily-drive-playlist-update"&gt;Your Daily Drive playlist&lt;/a&gt;, which updates daily with music and spoken word content, as well as its push into podcasts. I default to the radio often because it’s the easiest thing to put on. Car Thing, if I keep it in my car, would admittedly change that and give Spotify more of my listening time, and that’s likely all Spotify wants.&lt;/p&gt;
