    <title>It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo still doesn’t have Android 11</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mX5DZJ"&gt;We are officially in 2022. Know what that means? That’s right: It means Microsoft has failed at its stated goal of bringing Android 11 to the Surface Duo by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je2iK7"&gt;Attentive readers may recall that Microsoft said the following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;this past September&lt;/a&gt;: “We remain committed to providing updates to Surface Duo, and we’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.” Okay, so the company wasn’t exactly &lt;em&gt;promising&lt;/em&gt; Android 11 by the end of 2021 — but that was the heavily implied intention, and it likely gave some Surface Duo users a lot of hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="leiZWq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pB5Ox"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-fails-deliver-android-11-surface-duo-end-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported, Duo devices still haven’t received Android 11. While this may be disappointing to the owners of those devices, it’s also not without precedent. Update hiccups are par for the course with Android — all kinds of manufacturers consistently fail to get them out in a timely manner. “The story on upgrades is the same today as it was a decade ago: first-party Google devices get updated quickly, everything else takes months or doesn’t get updated at all,” summarized &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;executive editor Dieter Bohn in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;a 2019 newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE9SI4"&gt;Microsoft also needs to make Android work with additional controls and functionality in order to accommodate the Duo’s two screens — Android, as an operating system, is “woefully unprepared for devices like the Surface Duo,” Bohn noted in his&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt; review of the device&lt;/a&gt;. One might expect such a product to take a bit to roll out. Still, Duo users haven’t received major software improvements since the device launched 15 months ago — and that’s a long wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6cMdQ"&gt;Microsoft has not yet responded to a request for comment, and &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; claims to have gotten a “useless no comment” in response to their inquiry. Fortunately, &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; has heard from sources that “the Android 11 update for Surface Duo is in fact done and should begin rolling out once the update has been certified by Google and AT&amp;amp;T.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oL5U0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square Enix promises ‘decentralized games’ in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Smash Bros. Cloud" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9-lV3XQCiAsEMXjRGgSBtS5Goc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70337245/WiiU_SuperSmashBros_111215_screen_01_bmp_jpgcopy.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjLClb"&gt;What would a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; look like if it were partly powered by the blockchain, so gamers could make money from their contributions? You may get to find out: Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda has revealed that the company’s New Year’s resolution is to release “decentralized games” starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1vvSc"&gt;While you won’t find any details &lt;a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html"&gt;in Masuda’s letter discussing the company’s strategy for the new year&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a good sense of his cautious-but-optimistic stance — not surprising, given how &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-nft-announcement-has-been-intensely-disliked-1848182203"&gt;other game companies&lt;/a&gt; that recently Leeroy Jenkins’d their way into NFTs saw such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840383/stalker-2-developer-explain-nfts-gsc-game-world-deleted-tweet"&gt;immediate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;whiplash&lt;/a&gt; you could practically feel the vibrations over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1N2hN"&gt;Here’s the most relevant section, which comes near the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YT7ivP"&gt;From having fun to earning to contributing, a wide variety of motivations will inspire people to engage with games and connect with one another. It is blockchain-based tokens that will enable this. By designing viable token economies into our games, we will enable self-sustaining game growth. It is precisely this sort of ecosystem that lies at the heart of what I refer to as “decentralized gaming,” and I hope that this becomes a major trend in gaming going forward. If we refer to the one-way relationship where game players and game providers are linked by games that are finished products as “centralized gaming” to contrast it with decentralized gaming, then incorporating decentralized games into our portfolio in addition to centralized games will be a major strategic theme for us starting in 2022. The basic and elemental technologies to enable blockchain games already exist, and there has been an increase in the societal literacy and acceptance of crypto assets in the past few years. We will keep a close eye on societal shifts in this space while listening to the many groups of users that populate it, and ramp up our efforts to develop a business accordingly, with an eye to potentially issuing our own tokens in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QwMBoq"&gt;It also probably helps that Square Enix doesn’t name any &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; games that might get the blockchain / token treatment, so there aren’t any specific communities of fans ready to come out bearing pitchforks quite yet, unlike with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;Ubisoft’s Ghost Recon NFT announcement&lt;/a&gt; or GSG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59OVKv"&gt;When gigantic gaming companies are faced with the realization that oodles of cash are locked up in the buzzwords “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;,” they’re usually happy to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832490/niantic-ceo-john-hanke-metaverse-pokemon-go-ar-vr-podcast-decoder-interview"&gt;they’ve been-there, done-that&lt;/a&gt;, if they — like Square Enix — have been plugging away at the whole fantasy-meets-reality and / or multiple-world thing for years. Square Enix could have brought up how it already merged &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; with beloved Disney lands via its &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; series of games, or how it brought Cloud and Sephiroth and some &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; items, stages, and music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt;to Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the very sort of cross-game pollination that metaverse proponents suggest we’ll see a lot more of once we figure out the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxzxP2"&gt;Instead, the company is dipping a philosophical toe in the water, strongly signaling its intent, and — perhaps — waiting to see how its passionate fanbases react to the idea of Square Enix issuing its own tokens, Square Enix designing more economies into its games, and those games becoming somewhat more about money than they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qp6601"&gt;Square Enix is also promising “ample investments in the cloud space,” though it’s not clear if the company is talking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18683382/what-is-cloud-gaming-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-faq-explainer"&gt;cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt;. “We are exploring potential efforts in the cloud space from two primary perspectives, the first being leveraging cloud technologies to distribute content and the second being developing content that offers customers new forms of excitement enabled by the cloud’s attributes,” Matsuda writes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb will hide guests’ names to fight discrimination (but only in Oregon)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logo Illustration In Athens" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NAcTtaaWOdnWUf7UQZp_Mahpog0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70337003/1236360050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsvRLF"&gt;Airbnb announced that it’s changing the way guest profiles are displayed in its app — for Oregon residents specifically. Airbnb hosts who are based in Oregon will now see a potential guest’s initials, rather than their full name, until after they’ve confirmed that guest’s booking request. The change will fully roll out by January 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6AQxz"&gt;The change aims to prevent racial discrimination among hosts, &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/update-for-guests-who-are-oregon-residents/"&gt;per the company’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, by stopping them from gleaning a guest’s race from their name. &lt;a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/racial-discrimination-in-the-sharing-economy-evidence-from-a-field-experiment"&gt;A 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that Airbnb guests with names that sounded Black were 16 percent less likely to have bookings confirmed than guests with names that sounded white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQMlsB"&gt;The announcement follows a &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/08/airbnb-settles-oregon-discrimination-suit.html"&gt;voluntary settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; that Airbnb reached in 2019 with three Portland-area women who had sued the company. The plaintiffs, all Black, alleged that the platform allowed hosts to discriminate against Black users in requiring guests to attach names and photographs to their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSu5PR"&gt;After settling with the plaintiffs, Airbnb announced that it would “review and update the way profile names are displayed to hosts as part of the booking process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLeeaH"&gt;The company has been vocal about its support for racial justice in the past. It now requires users to agree to an &lt;a href="https://blog.atairbnb.com/the-airbnb-community-commitment/"&gt;Airbnb Community Commitment&lt;/a&gt; certifying that they won’t discriminate. It also launched &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fa-new-way-were-fighting-discrimination-on-airbnb-201&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Project Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative to uncover and research discrimination on its platform, in the summer of 2020. Prior to the launch of that program, the company says it did not have a way to measure “larger trends and patterns related to discrimination” across its bookings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kfx67i"&gt;Airbnb guests are not required to provide profile photos (though hosts can require them in order to book their properties). Since 2018 (&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/2017/03/oregon_woman_sues_airbnb_says.html"&gt;post-lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, pre-settlement), the platform has also &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fairbnb-answers-guest-profile-photos-77&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;kept guest photographs invisible to hosts&lt;/a&gt; before bookings are confirmed. That change, also intended to combat discrimination, has proved somewhat controversial among Airbnb’s users, some of whom worry that it could put marginalized guests in dangerous situations they’d otherwise avoid. “I’d rather get declined for a reservation than beaten or killed!” one user lamented in the company’s &lt;a href="https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Horrible-And-Dangerous-New-Profile-Pic-Policy/td-p/924339"&gt;community center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4jvtz"&gt;But if the company does expect such a strategy to reduce discrimination, why is it limited to Oregon? Reached for comment, Airbnb spokesperson Liz DeBold Fusco did not directly address whether this feature will expand in the future. Fusco pointed to language in Airbnb’s announcement post, which reads, “As part of our ongoing work, we will take any learnings from this process and use them to inform future efforts to fight bias.” The company added that it plans to “continue working with our Hosts and guests, and with civil rights leaders to make our community more inclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwJeX9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new ad invites you to imagine dying alone without a Watch on your wrist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EsscqcojoVWyol0sEAfxmpAttbo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336936/maxresdefault__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cx6aL7"&gt;Apple wants you to know that buying a $400 smartwatch could be a matter of life-and-death — and it’s brilliantly, gruesomely captured that feeling in a new TV ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJXVSP"&gt;Titled “911,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2JiwEARFo"&gt;the one-minute ad spot&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t show any of the gory details — you simply hear three phone conversations between 911 operators and people who managed to use their Apple Watch when facing seemingly imminent death: one who might drown in a sinking car, one who fell a great distance and broke his leg, and a paddleboarder who got swept out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiOZiV"&gt;They each have a happy ending, Apple informs us: “With the help of their watch, Jason, Jim, and Amanda were rescued in minutes.” But the underlying message is brutally clear: if they didn’t have this miraculous life-saving product on their wrists, they could have died alone. Apple is well known for commissioning heartstring-plucking ads, and this one is no exception: it’s painfully easy to imagine myself bleeding out or drowning, with no help on the way, when I listen to their scared voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPI9Bg"&gt;I’m torn about this marketing, because it partially rings true. You don’t have to search long to find people who believe the Apple Watch genuinely saved their life. I nearly bought one for my dad a while back, believing it a small price to pay just in case it made a difference. (He declined; for one thing, he’s on Android.) Even though there are other smartwatches that could theoretically make emergency calls, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say an Apple Watch is the obvious choice, particularly if you believe the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702151/apple-watch-heartbeat-irregular-pulse-afib"&gt;irregular heartbeat flagging&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;walking steadiness indicator&lt;/a&gt; might also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff3a22"&gt;But that doesn’t change the fact that Apple is now selling you on &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;, edging into shady insurance salesman territory to do so. It’s a good ad, but it feels a little shameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0wCqeo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"},{"title":"Apple is bringing car crash detection to the iPhone, says the Wall Street Journal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757102/apple-iphone-car-crash-detection-feature-onstar"},{"title":"The Apple Watch heart monitor sends too many people to the doctor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"},{"title":"Apple Watch Series 7 review: time and time again","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ussr4T"&gt;Besides, the feature Apple’s showing off here is still &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;phone call — something you can also do with a phone. This is an optional, pricey gadget you have to remember to put on your wrist, compared to the phone that every Apple Watch customer already owns and keeps on their person — except, perhaps, in the middle of a car accident or a paddleboarding excursion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9brOLs"&gt;If I were in a life-or-death situation like these, would I really dial 911 from my watch? Perhaps I would, and be grateful. But I think it’s more likely I’d have my phone, rather than the Apple Watch that spends most of its time forgotten on my bedside shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TP2Sbu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T and Verizon may have to delay 5G deployments another two weeks over airline safety fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQc0cfDVFbOQyriJ8meFsw6J9eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336748/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOFwVV"&gt;US officials have asked AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to further delay new 5G deployments so that the Federal Aviation Administration can have more time to determine where they might interfere with airlines. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to the CEOs of the two telecoms on Friday requesting a delay of “no more than two weeks,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8V1bx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon had already delayed these deployments by a month over regulators’ concerns and planned to start the rollout on January 5th as a result. The two telecoms now &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1"&gt;tell &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they are reviewing the latest request for a further delay. Buttigieg and Dickson write that, even with an additional delay, they expect 5G deployment will still begin in January “with certain exceptions around priority airports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RXyjNT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers are miffed about the delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnAkNi"&gt;The two telecoms are eager to start deploying the new 5G spectrum that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;they bought in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the so-called C-band frequencies. Those frequencies of spectrum allow radio waves to hit a sweet spot between high speeds and long distances, allowing for higher-speed 5G deployments than traditional LTE spectrum can achieve, without the stifling distance limitations that come with millimeter wave 5G. Getting these deployments out is a critical step for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to make 5G a worthwhile upgrade and stay competitive with T-Mobile, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/t-mobiles-mid-band-5g-network-surpasses-200m-people-covered/2021/11/"&gt;already started deploying&lt;/a&gt; its own similar spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNSRyV"&gt;Officials have been concerned that C-band frequencies could interfere with altimeters and prevent the use of guided landing systems meant for times of low-visibility, threatening the safety of aircraft. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;On December 7th&lt;/a&gt;, the FAA went so far as to tell pilots they wouldn’t be able to use those guided and automatic landing systems at airports where there’s deemed to be interference, which could theoretically lead to many flight delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXBwPU"&gt;Buttigieg and Dickson want to identify “priority airports” and mitigation strategies so that most large commercial aircraft can “operate safely in all conditions.” Some proposals revolve around placing 5G “buffer zones” around airports, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-brace-for-flight-restrictions-in-5g-standoff-11639929603"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOIwwt"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are pretty unhappy about the delays. On Friday, the companies accused the aerospace industry of holding deployment “hostage” unless they covered the cost of altimeter upgrades. Verizon also went in on the airline industry, telling &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, “This industry which got a $54 billion taxpayer-funded, government bail out over the past couple years clearly has much bigger issues to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Winnie-the-Pooh and around 400,000 early sound recordings enter public domain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbUJyI4NtyS1oYJ_rTSUakyu9mc=/0x6:468x318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70336490/WinnieThePooh.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cover art for A. A. Milne’s &lt;em&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xTHmug"&gt;A. A. Milne’s &lt;em&gt;Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;/em&gt;, Ernest Hemingway’s &lt;em&gt;The Sun Also Rises&lt;/em&gt;, and other books, movies, and compositions from 1926 enter into the public domain today in the US. The works are now “free for all to copy, share, and build upon,” &lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2022/"&gt;according to Duke’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks which copyrighted materials will become public each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDk9sJ"&gt;This year, the usual list of books, movies, and compositions comes with a sizable bonus: a trove of around 400,000 early sound recordings. A recent law, the 2018 Music Modernization Act, standardized how early sound recordings are handled under federal copyright law. As part of that, it set today as the date that copyright protections would end for “recordings first published before 1923.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3gG9Tp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The advent of sound recording technology all the way through to early jazz and blues”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGhoGA"&gt;The recordings include “everything from the advent of sound recording technology all the way through to early jazz and blues,” Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke’s public domain center, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/31/1069434896/winnie-the-pooh-and-more-works-will-enter-the-public-domain-tomorrow"&gt;recently told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The recordings include works from Ethel Waters, Mamie Smith, and The Sousa Band, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lit7jg"&gt;Until a couple years ago, a 20-year copyright extension had stopped additional works from entering into the public domain. Passed in 1998, the law was widely seen as a protective measure for Disney, since the earliest Mickey Mouse cartoons, released in 1928, were just years from falling out of copyright. Those are now slated to enter public domain in 2024 — as long as there isn’t another last-minute update to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GltCjZ"&gt;This year’s batch already starts to add some complications for Disney. Both Winnie-the-Pooh&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Felix Salten’s &lt;em&gt;Bambi, A Life in the Woods &lt;/em&gt;head into the public domain today. Disney still retains copyright over its newer works and adaptations (and, as Jenkins points out, Disney holds brand trademarks as well). But the public is now free to reprint the original book, adapt it into a play or film, write a sequel, or use the appearance and traits of any of its characters, according to Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rXZ1e"&gt;You can now do all of this “without having to seek a license from Disney,” Jenkins writes. “This is how the public domain supports creativity.” (But heads up: Tigger wasn’t introduced until a couple years later, so that character still belongs to Disney.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Uhh2"&gt;Remixers may still have trouble navigating Disney’s control over the brand and later works, though. Jenkins has &lt;a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2022/bcvpd/"&gt;an entire piece up&lt;/a&gt; exploring how that could play out and explaining how brands aren’t allowed — or, at least, aren’t &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be allowed — to use trademark to bully people out of accessing public domain properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="intjls"&gt;So what we see remixers attempt (and get away with) over the next couple years when it comes to Pooh and friends could be a preview of how Disney will respond when the earliest Mickey Mouse copyright expires in just a couple years’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Merry Christmas! Santander Claus made a $176 million payment mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IRAQ-NEW YEAR-CHRISTMAS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hxXwzt5nlwVB5SKcSXcuCXJO3Z0=/1x0:5461x3640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70335231/1237483801.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by HUSSEIN FALEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ve6QaU"&gt;Some tens of thousands of people woke up on Christmas Day to doubled wages and a higher-than-expected bank balance after Santander did an oopsie, depositing £130 million ($176 million) into accounts held by its UK customers. Santander would now like the money back, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="928ipr"&gt;The deposit mishap was the result of a mysterious “scheduling issue,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/santander-bank-error-gives-thousands-an-unexpected-christmas-bonus-dd5vt2g87"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported the story. The bank confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that some payments were accidentally doubled. (Santander is characterizing it as a “technical issue.”) Those transactions included those from 2,000 businesses, as well as accidental deposits across 75,000 accounts of individuals and companies like a corporate Ebeneezer Scrooge who’d been scared into generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7tscZh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Santander will now use a process called ​​“bank error recovery” to collect the funds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37nhG6"&gt;The bank is now working to undo that generosity, Santander confirmed. Unfortunately for Santander, many of the deposits were made to accounts at other financial institutions, including HSBC, Barclays, and others. Santander will now use a process called ​​“bank error recovery” to collect the funds, though it’s unclear how many individuals have already spent the money, which could make this process a nightmare for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYlgsS"&gt;Incidentally, large sums of money being whoopsed into the wrong accounts is not uncommon. In April, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/bank-deposit-error-charles-schwab.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that a Louisiana woman was charged with fraud after failing to return $1.2 million mistakenly deposited into her account by Charles Schwab, which had originally intended to move just $82.56 into a Fidelity account. Kelyn Spadoni had used the funds to buy, among other things, a house and an SUV. She was subsequently fired from her job as a 911 dispatcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oW2k7s"&gt;Chase Bank, meanwhile, mistakenly deposited $50 billion into a Louisiana man’s account earlier this year. In a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/03/us/50-billion-mistakenly-deposited-bank-account-louisiana/index.html"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in July, Chase Bank blamed the issue on a “technical glitch,” adding that the account was ultimately returned to its correct balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlw5KL"&gt;In most cases, as with the aforementioned goofs, mistakenly deposited funds should be returned. One notable exception is Citibank’s $900 million mistake. After accidentally wiring nearly a &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; dollars to hedge funds, some of those hedge funds decided to hang on to the money — and a court ruled that was perfectly fine, due to pre-existing loan terms and convoluted systems Citi had in place for sending funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHIfO6"&gt;Unfortunately, “finders keepers” likely does not apply to the Santander crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 will close a day early because of COVID concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJng5S0iChVrOuaRcv-whEF9uDg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334726/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X3M40f"&gt;CES has dropped the last day of its 2022 tech conference in Las Vegas, and the show will now end on January 7th, the Consumer Technology Association announced today. The shorter schedule is “an additional safety measure” in the face of a surge of COVID-19 diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFgIXC"&gt;Over the last two weeks, a number of large companies — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22853157/ces-microsoft-canceled-omicron-covid"&gt;Microsoft &lt;/a&gt;and the company formerly known as Facebook — have dropped their physical presences at the conference. It’s the largest tech conference in the world, which typically pulls more than 10,000 people in each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s558Kt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CTA’s president and CEO has said the show “will and must go on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL08Yd"&gt;Yesterday the US set a grim new record in COVID: &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/us/coronavirus-cases-high.html"&gt;the highest number of infections reported daily&lt;/a&gt; — breaking a record set the day before. Las Vegas is located in Clark County, Nevada, &lt;a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/health/coronavirus-health/new-clark-county-reports-5th-highest-cases-in-pandemic-test-positivity-climbs-to-11-1/"&gt;where 11 percent of COVID tests&lt;/a&gt; are returning positive results. &lt;a href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/"&gt;Nevada’s COVID tracker&lt;/a&gt; flags Clark County as an area of elevated disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vh7JtV"&gt;More than 2,200 exhibitors are confirmed-in person for CES, the CTA said in its emailed statement. As exhibitors have curtailed their trips to Las Vegas, the CTA’s president and CEO, Gary Shapiro, has &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;said the show&lt;/a&gt; “will and must go on.” In today’s announcement, the CTA said that 143 companies have signed up for in-person exhibits in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7VzBk"&gt;Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination to get their badges. The CTA has also requested that they test for COVID-19 less than 24 hours before entering the conference, and will be giving away free rapid tests to help with that. Masks will be required for the show, and international travelers will get a free PCR test after the show ends.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration will continue ISS cooperation through 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EIXjqD02Z9p6qAbHTPKhrfeAm0w=/35x0:1565x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334637/1600px_International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS_132.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlzW2W"&gt;The US will continue to work with other countries’ space programs on the International Space Station through 2030, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/"&gt;NASA announced today&lt;/a&gt;. That will allow for an uninterrupted transition to a planned commercial space station (or stations!) in the late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX7v9"&gt;Funds for the ISS have already been approved through 2024. NASA administrator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440208/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson-interview-rockets-moon-plans-partnerships"&gt;Bill Nelson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in May &lt;/a&gt;that he wants to continue work on the ISS through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJ6cTZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ISS’s future was called into question in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0thkP"&gt;The ISS’s future was called into question in 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930154/nasa-international-space-station-president-trump-budget-request-2025"&gt;a draft budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; from President Donald Trump’s administration had scheduled ending support for the space station in 2025. More recently, escalating tensions between the US and Russia have threatened the cooperation required to work together on the ISS. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia blew up a satellite&lt;/a&gt;, creating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791176/russia-asat-satellite-test-space-debris-visualizations"&gt;dangerous debris cloud&lt;/a&gt; in Earth’s orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09NFEW"&gt;“It’s more important than ever that the United States continues to lead the world in growing international alliances and modeling rules and norms for the peaceful and responsible use of space,” Nelson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC0YbA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colorado fires close out a year of disastrous drought</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wildland fire in Boulder county burning hundreds of structures." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijy_Tryt537YB_uOCe7LO6SUJnE=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70334517/1362041399.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fires continue to burn into the evening in neighborhoods on December 30, 2021 in Louisville, Colorado. | Photo by Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yXt3Pq"&gt;Devastating fires in Colorado cap off a year of awful drought across the US. Dry conditions helped set the stage for blazes that scorched hundreds of homes and forced tens of thousands to evacuate just ahead of New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rFml3"&gt;The fires have been raging through suburbs near Denver since December 30th. Strong winds fanned the flames and knocked out power. About 6,000 acres and at least 500 homes had burned by Friday morning. But there were no casualties, which Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle called “miraculous” given the severity of the fire in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=310406430998077"&gt;press briefing&lt;/a&gt;. Families had “minutes” to evacuate their homes, Governor Jared Polis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzMqMX"&gt;More than two-thirds of Colorado’s land is experiencing “severe” drought, according to the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Officials &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/31/us/colorado-wildfires.html"&gt;suspect&lt;/a&gt; that downed power lines might have sparked the inferno, a problem that becomes more dangerous when a dry landscape provides plenty of tinder.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W1RWuk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;One of the many factors that lead to the devastating wildfire today is the recent record dryness. For all periods from Jul 1st to Dec 29th (essentially the second half of the year), Denver has been the driest on record by over an inch. Snowfall is at record low levels, too. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8OriOBPyTs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8OriOBPyTs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NWS Boulder (@NWSBoulder) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBoulder/status/1476803594196193280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxMh5i"&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; a particularly bad fire season this year. The potential for “significant fire activity” was “above normal” for nearly all of the West at some point this year, according to a February &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;outlook&lt;/a&gt; from the National Interagency Fire Center. By the end of the year, more than &lt;a href="https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn"&gt;7.8 million acres&lt;/a&gt; burned across the US — five percent more than the 10-year average of 7.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQw115"&gt;What’s typical for the US is changing because of the climate crisis. Severe fires have become &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL089858"&gt;much more frequent&lt;/a&gt; in the western US over the past few decades with hotter, drier seasons. On top of that, fire season — which used to run roughly from May to November — &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/27/wildfires-all-seasons"&gt;no longer seems to let up&lt;/a&gt;. Colorado’s blazes illustrate this, coming unusually late in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VHj7iG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What’s typical for the US is changing because of the climate crisis. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBFBBp"&gt;The fires in Colorado are just one catastrophic symptom of drought across the US. The Colorado River, a lifeline for 25 million people who rely on it for water, faced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;unprecedented water shortage&lt;/a&gt; this year. An official shortage was declared for the first time at the US’ largest reservoir, Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, in August. Water levels at the reservoir dipped to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;historic low&lt;/a&gt; in June. Mandatory &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/#/news-release/3950"&gt;water cuts&lt;/a&gt; will kick in for Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico starting January 1st. Arizona will face the steepest cuts, which are expected to hit farmers the hardest. In California, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;drought cut into the state’s available hydroelectricity&lt;/a&gt; — putting even more stress on a power grid that’s struggled to keep the lights on for many residents whenever fire weather picks up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK85rq"&gt;Heavy rain and record snow are now closing out the year in California. That’s been somewhat helpful in easing water shortages, but it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/california-record-snowfall-drought"&gt;not enough&lt;/a&gt; to end the drought. Climate change, no surprise, is behind the rise in extreme weather swings. It intensifies the world’s water cycle, says a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;landmark climate repor&lt;/a&gt;t published this year. So we’ll probably want to brace for another wild weather year in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
