    <title>Nintendo is officially closing its Redwood City and Toronto offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-_zegsYlSpgdeKWjkbt066v9S4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065346/acastro_190530_1777_nintendo_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="buKWZ9"&gt;Nintendo is closing its Redwood City, California and Toronto, Canada offices, the company confirmed in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-nintendo-shutters-california-office-1847966405"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the closure of the Redwood City offices earlier on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwqDdv"&gt;Here is the company’s full statement on the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eHs3Ig"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo of America headquarters are in Redmond, WA, and Vancouver, BC. We are moving more of our employees and operations into those headquarters and will be closing small satellite offices in Toronto, ON, and Redwood City, CA, over time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTfvZk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devon Pritchard, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs and Publisher Relations for Nintendo of America (NOA), will assume interim leadership of Sales, Marketing and Communications following the departure of Nick Chavez. Ms. Pritchard will oversee strategy and execution of sales, marketing and communications across the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KQuJJT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reports that about 100 employees have been displaced in the Redwood City offices as a result of the decision. Nintendo declined to comment when we asked how many employees would be affected by the move, but its statement above does suggest some employees will be able to relocate. It’s not clear why the offices are being closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZncHV"&gt;The Redwood City office is still shown on a map of Nintendo’s office locations on &lt;a href="https://careers.nintendo.com/about-us/"&gt;the company’s jobs website&lt;/a&gt;. “Here you’ll find the Sales and Marketing departments, as well as NMI, a dedicated merchandising field team who work with retail stores across the country,” a description reads. The Toronto office is also still on the site, described as a “sales office for NOCL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFjxY1"&gt;As of earlier today, there were &lt;a href="https://careers.nintendo.com/job-openings/"&gt;no open positions listed&lt;/a&gt; for the Redwood City location, even the company appears to have had an open role for a “Specialist, Experiential Marketing” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS968US968&amp;amp;ei=H258YYupMpy90PEP5daBgA4&amp;amp;oq=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjoHCAAQRxCwAzoECAAQQzoKCC4QxwEQ0QMQQzoFCAAQkQI6CwguEIAEELEDEIMBOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOhAILhCxAxCDARDHARDRAxBDOgcIABCxAxBDOggILhCABBCxAzoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6EQguEIAEELEDEIMBEMcBENEDOggIABCABBCxAzoICAAQsQMQkQI6CwgAELEDEIMBEJECOgUIABCABDoICAAQgAQQyQM6CAgAEMkDEMQCOgYIABAWEB46DggAEIAEELEDEIMBEMkDSgQIQRgAUOOpDVjs3w1gmuENaAFwAngAgAGXAYgB2ReSAQQyNy42mAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;ibp=htl;jobs&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUg_Cmz_DzAhWGHjQIHeLDB9MQkd0GegQIKhAB#fpstate=tldetail&amp;amp;htivrt=jobs&amp;amp;htiq=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;htidocid=1i0BSar28w0cW3CrAAAAAA%3D%3D"&gt;as recently as two days ago&lt;/a&gt;, according to Google caches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HAARTlLkud9IRrtLfT_Yaa82Clw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968113/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_3.15.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redwood City doesn’t have any open roles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNTtXP"&gt;Given that the Redwood City office was focused on sales, marketing, and merchandising, it likely won’t affect the development of Nintendo’s games or hardware. Most of Nintendo’s games are developed overseas, though it also has developer Retro Studios in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3YILG"&gt;The closure comes just weeks after the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;Nintendo Switch with an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of Nintendo’s biggest games of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitness app Supernatural is becoming part of Meta after Facebook touts VR fitness</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K5XNvjsy6je-oWdUhJTvX-2tStE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065319/Boxing_MR.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Supernatural&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Szd8Vn"&gt;Meta &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwithin-to-join-meta%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746070/supernatural-vr-workout-app-adds-boxing-oculus-quest"&gt;VR workout game Supernatural&lt;/a&gt; will be joining the company, adding to the roster of studios owned by what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;used to be known as&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s Oculus division. The company says that Within, the company behind Supernatural, will continue to work on the popular fitness app and will also help Meta’s Reality Labs “enhance future hardware to support VR fitness apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QOwsz"&gt;Meta scooping up Within isn’t necessarily a surprise move: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;spent the last few years&lt;/a&gt; acquiring tons of popular VR studios, like &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; devs Ready at Dawn, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;, and others working on projects that some have called the VR versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22530144/facebook-oculus-studios-acquires-bigbox-vr-population-one"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YtiwG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook cornering the VR market?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="nhazQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6GfxTu"&gt;Given Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749648/active-pack-oculus-quest-2-fitness-workouts-sweat-hygiene"&gt;focus on its headsets as workout tools&lt;/a&gt; (Supernatural even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOn2CZWnxxY"&gt;got a callout&lt;/a&gt; in its Connect keynote on Thursday), it tracks that Zuckerberg’s company would want to add a popular VR fitness game to its roster. The move, however, doesn’t help with concerns that Meta is going to end up owning the entire virtual reality market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kx1Qeg"&gt;While Supernatural&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is Within’s flagship app, &lt;a href="https://www.with.in/about"&gt;according to the company’s site&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also been the host of VR experiences, too — in 2016, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12253358/mr-robot-virtual-reality-elliot-flashback-story-sdcc-2016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Robot &lt;/em&gt;VR episode&lt;/a&gt; (executive produced by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;Within founder Chris Milk&lt;/a&gt;) was shown on the app, and the company’s website contains dozens of documentaries, music videos, and more. That streaming tech and library of content isn’t a bad get either for a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;trying to build a metaverse&lt;/a&gt; where people hang out and watch content together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PT9rVm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best thing to do in VR is work out","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>All iOS users can now Super Follow on Twitter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces test announcement" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q7mPX9qC4uayVHnJ8yHu0lV9854=/0x0:4892x3261/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065142/Hero_image__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaV4Z8"&gt;Twitter is allowing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1453847498200686596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;all iOS users to Super Follow select creators&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in September and only available in the US and Canada, allows users to monetize their Twitter account and create exclusive content through monthly subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOoJS0"&gt;Twitter first announced Super Follows in February and rolled it out to select creators in September. Within the first two weeks, subscribers had contributed around $6,000, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/"&gt;according to SensorTower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SkRkLm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s Super Following time –– everyone globally on iOS now has the option to Super Follow select creators.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1453847498200686596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DTf37s"&gt;Users interested in Super Follows have to meet the minimum requirements, according to the&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/super-follows-policy"&gt; Super Follows policy&lt;/a&gt;. They have to be 18 or older, have at least 10,000 followers, have tweeted at least 25 times in the past 30 days. Once accepted, they have to tweet a minimum of 25 tweets every 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4KXE8"&gt;Users are &lt;a href="https://media.twitter.com/en/articles/blogs/2021/be-the-first-to-try-ticketed-spaces-and-super-follows"&gt;eligible to earn up to 97 percent&lt;/a&gt; of revenue from their Super Follows subscription after in-app purchase fees, with Twitter taking 3 percent. However, if a user earns $50,000, they can earn up to 80 percent of revenue after in-app purchase fees, and Twitter will increase its share up to 20 percent of future earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rBkXa"&gt;Super Followers are supposed to have access to bonus content and get badges to be easily recognized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VZBCs"&gt;Twitter says it plans to include Android and web users in the future as it expands Super Follows. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HN7UBM"&gt;Roku is launching a new independent developer kit that will allow developers to “experiment with and customize their devices” in personal-use capacities. Roku says it hopes the IDK will lead to innovation around internet-of-things applications, such as connecting a Roku device to a thermostat or game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3yHSP"&gt;Roku unveiled its plans for the new IDK at its online developer summit this week. The company made it clear in an &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/developer/2021/10/26/idk"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about the IDK that its Roku SDK will remain the primary channel development kit for commercial applications but said that the new developer kit “enables developers to explore the platform’s capabilities and personalize their Roku experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P05wQs"&gt;The company isn’t quite clear on how developers will use the new IDK, Roku’s VP of content partnerships Tedd Cittadine said during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQb4EJug-WA"&gt;keynote address&lt;/a&gt;, but its primary purpose is to help Roku continue to innovate its platform. Some applications might include building games that work specifically with the Roku remote or building apps to control smart home devices around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ODdfHl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Developers can use the IDK and code in their favorite programming language to create applications beyond streaming channels.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0vhgza"&gt;“Developers can use the IDK and code in their favorite programming language to create applications beyond streaming channels,” the company said in an &lt;a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/idk/idk-faqs.md"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; about the new developer kit. “For example, developers can build applications in JavaScript that pull together data from various sources, effectively turning their TV monitor into a snapshot view of their daily news, weather, calendar appointments, and even traffic conditions for their office commute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKzkpT"&gt;Roku did specify that IDK applications will not be supported on Roku TVs, streambars, or its legacy streaming players. Roku devices will also need to be running Roku OS 10.5 or higher. In addition to the IDK launch, Roku announced it’s also launching a new beta channel tool for developers to test their apps before making changes live on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJU8Z6"&gt;Lastly, the company said that it will be removing non-certified channels from its platform by March of next year. These channels are SDK channels that are used for testing by developers. A spokesperson for the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they are “not published to the Roku channel store or shared publicly because in most cases, they are channels that are being tested ahead of launch.” The company declined to comment on how many non-certified channels would be affected by the change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit actually tore down Apple’s backordered $19 screen cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X9235Iq9RFn0msZiVqbVb_uj64c=/0x319:6899x4918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064814/finallayout.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZkUv0"&gt;I can’t say I expected there to be more news about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;Apple’s $19 Screen Polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt;, but here we are. Not only has iFixit given it the teardown treatment and a (perhaps slightly tongue-in-cheek) repair score, but it’s apparently become one of Apple’s hardest-to-get products. And yes, to reiterate, we are still talking about a cloth made to clean your devices’ screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x42ohl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/technology/apple-polishing-cloth.html"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 6.3-inch-sided square of fabric is now backordered, with Apple’s website saying that you won’t get it for 10-12 &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;meaning it’ll get delivered sometime between January 7th and January 21st, 2022. If you order pretty much any configuration of the redesigned MacBook Pro that the cloth launched with, you’ll get your custom-built laptop at least a week before you get your cleaning cloth — and that’s with the worst-case estimate for the MacBook and best-case one for the cloth. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DthHDomLTUNCKblqE2HtQVOd4RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967806/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_13.29.29.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not too bad, in comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bd9KG"&gt;Why is this happening? How did it catch the attention of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown"&gt;looking at iFixit’s teardown&lt;/a&gt; will provide some answers! (Spoiler: nope.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQbSYT"&gt;iFixit doesn’t have a dedicated page for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin"&gt;The Cloth&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll have to scroll past a bunch of boring details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;the MacBook that I’m definitely not drooling over&lt;/a&gt; to see the results. Once you do, though, its a surprisingly in-depth look at the accessory. iFixit reveals that it’s actually two pieces of material glued together and even takes a microscope to it to compare it to regular old microfiber. The teardown is brief (obviously, it’s literally a cloth), but well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1VBQZsZkcoliO91AQdlJeqkmpgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967824/interiorshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Breaking news: it’s a cloth &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; a potential ravioli.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dIUev8"&gt;But when compared to the actually decent (for Apple, at least) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22517104"&gt;reparability of the new MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, the Polishing Cloth gets a disappointing 0 / 10 repair score for distracting the iFixit crew. That’s really a bummer, because if you accidentally cut yours to pieces like iFixit did, you’ll have to wait a couple months to get a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhLKrw"&gt;Finally, if you needed yet another reason to check out &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown"&gt;iFixit’s article&lt;/a&gt; (besides, you know, the in-depth technical breakdown of Apple’s new laptops) just know that it has one of the funniest &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZVkW9p-cCU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Psycho&lt;/em&gt; references&lt;/a&gt; I’ve seen for a while. Hats off to you, iFixit, for providing us with something fun to look at on a Friday (and for coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s birthday party&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7022385139283922182?is_copy_url=0&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;sender_web_id=6998606657735525894"&gt;teach people how to fix JoyCon&lt;/a&gt; last weekend). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix employees at the heart of the Dave Chappelle controversy file charges against the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T5UJEXG6Oc1qdQiL9HEsFKnf9p8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064779/acastro_211025_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OOsOfR"&gt;Two Netflix employees at the heart of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;Dave Chappelle controversy&lt;/a&gt; have filed labor charges against the company, alleging the streaming giant retaliated against them for engaging in protected activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFVV2l"&gt;B. Pagels-Minor, a Black trans program manager, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728337/netflix-fires-organizer-trans-employee-walkout-dave-chappelle"&gt;fired while organizing a walkout&lt;/a&gt; related to Netflix’s support of Chappelle’s comedy special&lt;em&gt; The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which has been widely condemned as transphobic. Terra Field, a trans software engineer, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;suspended after posting a viral tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; about the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYna08"&gt;Netflix said it fired Pagels-Minor for allegedly leaking confidential information — a charge they have categorically denied. The company said Field was suspended for attending a director-level meeting she wasn’t supposed to, though it reinstated her after finding no ill intent. In the charge, Field says she and hundreds of other Netflix employees were invited to attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdpKbP"&gt;Now, the employees are filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. They say Netflix’s actions were designed to stop workers from speaking out about their working conditions, including the desire to create a safe environment for Netflix staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2kd2p"&gt;“This charge is not just about B. and Terra, and it’s not about Dave. It’s about trying to change the culture and having an impact for others,” says attorney Laurie Burgess. “The charge is all about collective action. It’s about supporting your coworkers and speaking up for things you care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQbmTd"&gt;Filing with the NLRB supports the goal of collective action. But it’s also an easier choice than filing in state court, as both Pagels-Minor and Field signed Netflix employment agreements that require them to resolve disputes in private arbitration, &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-growing-use-of-mandatory-arbitration/"&gt;a process that tends to favor the employer&lt;/a&gt;. (This is common at large tech companies, though both Google and Activision Blizzard have recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;ended forced arbitration&lt;/a&gt; due to employee organizing efforts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV1gBg"&gt;The NLRB investigates all charges it receives. If it finds the allegations have merit, it can try to secure a settlement or, if that fails, issue a complaint. For employees, the best-case scenario outside of settling is getting reinstated with backpay and forcing Netflix to post a notice that workers are allowed to engage in protected activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="My53N6"&gt;In a carefully worded statement, Netflix implied Pagels-Minor was the source &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;behind a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; that contained internal metrics about how much Netflix paid for &lt;em&gt;The Closer. &lt;/em&gt;The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/media/netflix-employee-fired-david-chappelle/index.html"&gt;narrative then spread in the media&lt;/a&gt;, though employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they didn’t believe it was true. After Pagels-Minor was fired, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; continued to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-17/dave-chappelle-s-special-cost-more-than-squid-game?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;publish stories containing internal metrics&lt;/a&gt; about Netflix shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XASC0W"&gt;B., who is 35 weeks pregnant, is now about to lose their health insurance. “Amidst all the stress, I am trying to take one day at a time and focus on my health,” they said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a high-risk pregnancy, I have to be careful. We don’t even know what our health insurance situation is, and we are scheduled to be in a hospital having a baby in less than 30 days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGIqbk"&gt;Field has applied for medical leave from Netflix. Since speaking out, she has received a credible death threat and been doxxed. “This is what happens with trans people — we’re tolerated as long as we’re quiet, but if we speak up we get harassed,” she says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It has been a really stressful few weeks, but I intend to keep fighting for our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XOR16"&gt;Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is continuing to stand by the special, although he’s &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/netflix-ted-sarandos-speaks-up-dave-chapplle-the-closer-controversy-interview-1234858762/"&gt;walked back previous claims&lt;/a&gt; that “content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx5cgk"&gt;Earlier this week, a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; investigation found that in 2020, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747488/netflix-suppress-cuties-algorithm-search-results-dave-chappelle"&gt;suppressed search results after the controversy around the film &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to quell public outrage. The company did not take similar steps for &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acWfW7"&gt;The trans employee resource group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733098/netflix-trans-employees-demands-dave-chappelle-walkout"&gt;released a list of demands&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the October 20th walkout. They want Netflix to invest in trans creators and revise internal processes on commissioning potentially harmful content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySGJ8E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit teardown of the 2021 MacBook Pro reveals easier battery swaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stretchy adhesive being pulled out of the MacBook case" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4XKs1Pzbz9ciQvtwenwg88di68=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064757/MBP_M1_2021_42e3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The trackpad has to be removed to reveal two of the pull tabs | Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwFeoc"&gt;Online tech repair guide and parts retailer iFixit has published its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54122%2Fmacbook-pro-2021-teardown&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F29%2F22753063%2Fmacbook-pro-ifixit-teardown-battery-swaps-pull-tabs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest teardown&lt;/a&gt; for the new 2021 MacBook Pro and reveals at least one small win for reparability: the ability to replace the battery pack modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwjDJY"&gt;The battery modules in the new MacBook Pros, much like many mobile devices, are now attached via adhesive strips with pull tabs. This makes it easier to remove them, as long as none of the tabs rip while pulling. The trackpad needs to also be carefully removed to reach the remaining pull tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2W2ZP-_AkC5s1ZYf852Xw5BjVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967611/MBP_M1_2021_117_Updated3f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iInWyk"&gt;Batteries in MacBook Pros used to have their own frame or shell, which made them easier to install or remove via screws or locking tabs (although that takes more interior space). Starting in 2012, Apple wanted to make laptops thinner, so battery structures were removed to save some real estate. The biggest issue with MacBook Pro model years 2012–2020 was that Apple used glue to all but permanently fuse the battery to the top case of the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2L7j3q"&gt;HDMI and SD card ports are fixed to the logic board, but the rest of the ports are modular, though you would have to remove the whole logic board to replace them. Fans and the speakers also require a logic board removal before a replacement is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X4IIqJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple MacBook Pro 14 and 16 review: return to form","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oglYwI"&gt;The only real remaining qualms are that replacing the screen would mean losing True Tone, and replacing Touch ID would lose its main ability. While Touch ID in iPhones being non-repairable used to make sense for security reasons, it’s interesting to see no new development on reparability here since Apple’s new wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397196/magic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel"&gt;Touch ID keyboard&lt;/a&gt; can be paired to different M1 computers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft overtakes Apple to become the world’s most valuable company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_S6-ZSuIqJAq06MfIPCm8Y-DUFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064740/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0rvyfP"&gt;Microsoft surpassed Apple’s market cap on Friday to become the world’s most valuable public company. The change follows Apple’s Thursday earnings, where the company posted strong results but revealed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;lost $6 billion to supply chain constraints&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747241/microsoft-q1-2022-earnings-revenue-cloud-services-surface-gaming-xbox"&gt;Microsoft also shared positive earnings&lt;/a&gt; boosted by Office, Windows, and its cloud products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhS3PO"&gt;At Friday’s market close, Microsoft’s market cap was almost $2.49 trillion while Apple’s was about $2.46 trillion, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/microsoft-passes-apple-to-become-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t the first time Microsoft has passed Apple; the Windows-maker surpassed Apple’s market cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18109784/microsoft-apple-market-cap-2018-valuable-company"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2010 and once again in July 2020. (Alphabet has also taken the crown from Apple, surpassing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/1/10889286/alphabet-passed-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company"&gt;Apple’s market cap in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnHud8"&gt;But Apple has been a leader in the markets for some time, being the first US company to hit a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;$1 trillion market cap in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and, just two years later, becoming the first US company to hit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;a $2 trillion market cap&lt;/a&gt;. (The iPhone is still a massively successful product, after all.) So it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Apple retakes the title of the world’s most valuable company sometime soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastodon puts Trump’s social network on notice for improperly using its code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVWvrXF3wPoPiq65FmRo2QIOTS8=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70064410/mastodon.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2Np4L"&gt;Mastodon has sent former President Donald Trump’s company a formal notification that it’s breaking the rules by using Mastodon’s open-source code to build its social network, named Truth. This news comes from &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/"&gt;a blog post by Mastodon’s founder Eugen Rochko&lt;/a&gt;, but others have previously pointed out that the organization behind Truth, the Trump Media and Technology Group (or TMTG), was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740354/trump-truth-social-network-spac-mastodon-license-software-freedom-conservancy"&gt;violating Mastodon’s software license by not providing the source code&lt;/a&gt; for the site built on top of it. Trump’s group has 30 days from when the letter was sent to comply with the license or stop using the software, or it could lose the right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqIqmG"&gt;While Truth hasn’t officially launched yet, internet users discovered that a test version basically had the same interface as Mastodon, and that &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93b5kp/mastodon-lawyers-tell-truth-social-trump-source-code-public"&gt;some of the code for the site was unchanged&lt;/a&gt; from the other social network’s code. By itself, that’s actually the intended use of open-source software — but as the &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-group-agplv3/"&gt;Software Freedom Conservancy pointed out last week&lt;/a&gt;, apps or websites based on software that uses the AGPLv3 license have to in turn provide their own source code. According to &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhyUseGPL"&gt;the foundation that wrote AGPL&lt;/a&gt;, it’s meant to make the community’s software better: if you improve on something that someone else made, they should be able to benefit from your work like you did theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vDz6av"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Calling your software proprietary doesn’t work when it’s not your code&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s77Tq6"&gt;As Mastodon and Rochko reiterated on Friday, though, TMTG hasn’t done that — it &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/terms-of-service/"&gt;even went as far as to call its software “proprietary,”&lt;/a&gt; and seemingly tried to hide the fact that it was based on Mastodon. Now that the Truth has been revealed, however, TMTG will either have to rebuild it without using Mastodon’s code — a tall order, as bootstrapping a social network site isn’t particularly easy — or release its source code and change the terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssf4DS"&gt;It’s not the first time Mastodon has had to deal with, as &lt;a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/"&gt;Rochko puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “people so antithetical to [its] values” trying to build on top of its open-source platform. In 2019 Gab, a social network known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;getting banned from almost everything&lt;/a&gt; due to how many toxic users it had, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;decided it would use Mastodon as a backend&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike that situation though, where Gab wasn’t really breaking any rules (at least regarding its use of the software), Truth is violating the AGPL by using Mastodon's code in an unauthorized way. How TMTG will deal with the gauntlet now that it’s been thrown down (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740354/trump-truth-social-network-spac-mastodon-license-software-freedom-conservancy"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;) is anyone’s guess, but it’ll have to respond unless it wants to open itself up to possible legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzstYD"&gt;Trump Media and Technology Group didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
