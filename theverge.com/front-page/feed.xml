    <title>Oculus’ Passthrough API will enable experiences that mix VR and the real world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cqku3DlViVzU8OmWZJ4DFXr9n0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624661/akrales_200904_4160_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="399LsB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/"&gt;Facebook announced&lt;/a&gt; a new API that will let developers incorporate video from the Quest 2’s sensors into their games and applications, creating a mixed reality experience. With the Passthrough API, developers will not only be able to mix the black-and-white images from the headset’s sensors into their experiences, but they’ll also be able to customize how it ends up looking to the player, apply effects, and even have the real world show up on specific surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NSqs5"&gt;Facebook’s announcement includes examples of how the API could improve productivity software by allowing integration of real-life keyboards and desks, and how games could include your real-life furniture for enemies to hide behind. It’s also easy to imagine other fun experiences that mix your real environment with a virtual world — how about Portal-esque puzzles that you solve in your own house, or the ability to see your walls covered in virtual paint?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of mixed reality controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hffGQP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/mixed-realiy-passthrough-api/"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the API was currently only for the Quest 2 when asked about compatibility with the first-generation Quest. In the announcement post, Facebook says the image processing for the API is done on-device and that applications using it won’t be able to see or store the images from the Quest 2’s sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrUCbu"&gt;Facebook is adding the experimental version of the API to its upcoming developer tools, and it’ll be available first to programmers using Unity to build their software. Facebook does promise that the API will be getting support for other development platforms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3KhDOR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A virtual office in your real office&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6VYT12"&gt;The Quest, Quest 2, and Rift S headsets &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/what-is-passthrough"&gt;already have a version of the Passthrough technology&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users get a quick look at what’s happening around them in the real world. Facebook also lets you &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-passthrough-home/"&gt;set Passthrough as your virtual environment&lt;/a&gt;, giving you a version of your real environment (albeit in black and white) that you can navigate the Oculus UI in. It even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_bVkbG1ZCo"&gt;showed off that ability&lt;/a&gt; in a video about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382805/oculus-quest-2-facebook-wireless-pc-streaming-120hz-infinite-office"&gt;its Infinite Office feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zNNybS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_bVkbG1ZCo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m03nkG"&gt;The ability to integrate your real environment into a virtual world has long been one of the more exciting promises of headsets with integrated cameras. Microsoft even invoked the idea when it named its VR platform Windows Mixed Reality (regardless of how much that’s actually been delivered on). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgVHIA"&gt;The news of Oculus’ API doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to pick up your headset and have a mixed reality experience today, however. &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/"&gt;In its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook says it’s looking to let developers ship software using Passthrough to players “later this year.” Still, this API’s availability to developers is exciting, as it should allow for new types of experiences on the Oculus platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NSO’s Pegasus spyware: here’s what we know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZzPQxNP3OfxD1NrjDD8WJhwEMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624418/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9CVHZQ"&gt;Throughout the past week, we’ve seen story after story about a company called NSO Group, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;a piece of spyware called Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the stories have been shocking, with allegations that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;fully updated smartphones can be hacked with a single text message&lt;/a&gt;, and reports that two women close to murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/jamal-khashoggi-wife-fiancee-cellphone-hack/"&gt;were among those targeted&lt;/a&gt; by a government agency using the spy tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zewapH"&gt;A coalition of news outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; is behind the reporting, and they’re calling it the Pegasus Project. The project was led by Forbidden Stories, an organization of journalists that works on stories after the original reporters have been silenced in some way. Amnesty International &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;ran detailed forensics&lt;/a&gt; on 67 smartphones to look for evidence that they were targeted by Pegasus spyware — and 37 of those phones tested positive. But many crucial details still aren’t clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxXEFq"&gt;Here’s what we know about the NSO Group and Pegasus so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="CFiMw7"&gt;What is Pegasus, and who or what is NSO Group?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="BlqAJm"&gt;Pegasus is spyware developed by a private contractor for use by government agencies. The program infects a target’s phone and sends back data, including photos, messages, and audio / video recordings. Pegasus’ developer, an Israeli company called NSO Group, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; the software can’t be traced back to the government using it — a crucial feature for clandestine operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVwEQW"&gt;In short, NSO Group makes products that let governments spy on citizens. The company describes the role of its products on its website as helping “government intelligence and law-enforcement agencies use technology to meet the challenges of encryption” during terrorism and criminal investigations. But as you might imagine, civil liberties groups aren’t happy about the spyware-for-hire business, and restricting the business to government clients does little to quiet their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zUPJa"&gt;The company told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it works only with government agencies, and &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;that it will cut off an agency’s access&lt;/a&gt; to Pegasus if it finds evidence of abuse. In &lt;a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ReportBooklet.pdf"&gt;its transparency report&lt;/a&gt; released at the end of June, the company claimed it has done that before. Still, an Amnesty International statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1418212758185648146/photo/2"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that the company is providing spyware to oppressive governments, where government agencies can’t be trusted to do right by their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwzVSa"&gt;The Forbidden Stories&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;organization, which helped lead the Pegasus Project’s efforts, &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;has a write-up&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s exploits and controversies over the past decade, some of which have inspired lawsuits from journalists and activists arguing that NSO’s software has been used improperly. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/"&gt;has an interview&lt;/a&gt; that covers the company’s own story about how it was founded and how it got started in the surveillance industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Tp0mIV"&gt;Who was being spied on?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tRH8HB"&gt;We don’t know for sure. However, much of the reporting centers around &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;a list containing 50,000 phone numbers&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose of which is unclear. The Pegasus Project analyzed the numbers on the list and linked over 1,000 of them to their owners. When it did so, it found people who should’ve been off-limits to governmental spying (based on &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;the standards NSO says it holds its clients to&lt;/a&gt;): hundreds of politicians and government workers — &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/"&gt;including three presidents, 10 prime ministers, and a king&lt;/a&gt; — plus 189 journalists, and 85 human rights activists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="wVZNPh"&gt;Wait, who made this list?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="48fNZu"&gt;At this point, that’s clear as mud. NSO says the list has nothing to do with its business, &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;and claims&lt;/a&gt; it’s from a simple database of cellular numbers that’s a feature of the global cellular network. A statement from an Amnesty International spokesperson, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1418212758185648146/photo/1"&gt;posted to Twitter by cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter&lt;/a&gt;, says that the list indicates numbers that were marked as “of interest” to NSO’s various clients. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; says that the list is from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2DDdx6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amnesty says the Israeli media mis-reported a statement it gave them in Hebrew about the list of 50,000 phone numbers. See here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/rhksVHineG"&gt;https://t.co/rhksVHineG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I obtained the full Hebrew statement they gave reporters, and the Israeli media quoted it correctly. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9JNmwC3QW4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9JNmwC3QW4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kim Zetter (@KimZetter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1418212758185648146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mPmb5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; says the list doesn’t contain information about who added numbers to it, or whether people linked to the numbers were under surveillance. Was the list curated by a shadowy government agency trying to get on the good side of other governments? Was it maintained by a Slack group of Pegasus users? Was it simply a list of numbers? It’s an essential question that remains frustratingly unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pdyF1s"&gt;So does the list matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="HroP2i"&gt;It seems to. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that some of the phones analyzed were targeted shortly after they were added to the list. In some cases, only a few seconds separate timestamps that indicate when the phone number was added to the list and incidents of Pegasus attacks on the phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tukWMn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/spyware-leak-suggests-lawyers-and-activists-at-risk-across-globe"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amnesty ran its analysis on 67 phones connected to the numbers. It found that 37 of the phones had been at least targeted by Pegasus, and that 23 of those phones had been successfully hacked. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;details how Pegasus was used&lt;/a&gt; to hack a phone belonging to the wife of an imprisoned activist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7FWyvr"&gt;Who else is on the list?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="alsC5x"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; report &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/"&gt;details some of the highest-ranking officials with numbers on the list&lt;/a&gt;. According to an analysis done by the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;and other Pegasus Project members, the current presidents of France, Iraq, and South Africa were included, along with the current prime ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, and Morocco, seven former prime ministers, and the king of Morocco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXlLeL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/dubai-princesses-spyware/"&gt;A separate report&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; claims that the Moroccan king was not the only royalty whose number appeared on the list — a princess from Dubai was also added, along with some of her friends, as she was trying to gain political asylum. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56085369"&gt;Her attempt failed&lt;/a&gt; when she was allegedly kidnapped by armed commandos who boarded the yacht she was using to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDeHq5"&gt;Also on the list were two women close to Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399"&gt;who was murdered in 2018.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EECTmO"&gt;Was Khashoggi himself on the list?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="Aq6mJJ"&gt;It doesn’t seem so (though we’ll deal with some nuances in a moment), but people close to him were. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; has reported that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/jamal-khashoggi-wife-fiancee-cellphone-hack/"&gt;one of those hacked phones belonged to Khashoggi’s fiancé&lt;/a&gt;, and that there’s reportedly evidence that his wife’s phone was targeted as well. NSO’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;has strongly denied&lt;/a&gt; that Khashoggi’s wife was a target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8pPUL"&gt;As to whether NSO targeted Khashoggi himself, that’s a question without a definite answer. NSO strongly denies that it was involved — it &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;did so in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and again recently, with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; citing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/07/18/nso-group-response-pegasus-project/"&gt;a statement from the company&lt;/a&gt; that its technology “was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi.” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/jamal-khashoggi-wife-fiancee-cellphone-hack/"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khashoggi’s phone is in the custody of Turkish authorities who are carrying out an investigation of the journalist’s homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ZIiQSs"&gt;What does Pegasus &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ldg74i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the spyware can steal private data from a phone, sending a target’s messages, passwords, contacts, photos, and more to whoever initiated the surveillance. It can reportedly even turn on the phone’s cameras or microphones to create covert recordings. A &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;document from NSO&lt;/a&gt; describes the software’s capabilities in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYgid0"&gt;Recent versions of it have reportedly been able to do this without having to get the user to do anything — a link is sent to their phone, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;without a notification&lt;/a&gt;, and Pegasus starts collecting information. In other cases, Pegasus has reportedly &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;relied on users to click phishing links&lt;/a&gt; that then deliver the Pegasus payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="59o9XX"&gt;Wait, how can Pegasus get all that info?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qNOngv"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have articles explaining how even modern phones with the latest software updates can be exploited. (&lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;Amnesty has shown&lt;/a&gt; that even some of the most recent versions of iOS are vulnerable to methods used by NSO.) The summary is that no software is perfect. Where there’s complicated software, like iMessage or WhatsApp, there will be bugs, and some of those bugs will give hackers access to way more than many would think is possible. And, with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/technology/nso-group-how-spy-tech-firms-let-governments-see-everything-on-a-smartphone.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;millions of dollars at stake&lt;/a&gt;, hackers and security researchers are very motivated to find those bugs, even if they’ll only be usable for a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ntZHPI"&gt;It can do all that on iPhones? What about Apple’s security and privacy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="RZh3MB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple didn’t deny NSO’s capability to exploit iPhones, instead saying that attacks like Pegasus are “highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals,” thereby not affecting most Apple customers. Apple did say that it continues “to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJAsfp"&gt;Still, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; points out,&lt;/a&gt; the fact that the iPhone could be so thoroughly compromised by a reportedly invisible message is unfortunate for a company that prides itself on security and privacy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;one that put up&lt;/a&gt; “what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone” billboards. Security researchers who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;mainly lay the blame on iMessage and its preview software — despite &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/28/apple-adopts-new-blastdoor-security-system-on-ios-14-to-reinforce-imessage-integrity/"&gt;the protections that Apple has reportedly implemented recently&lt;/a&gt; to try to secure iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="TPfDyh"&gt;Are only iPhones vulnerable?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="nxBmk0"&gt;No. A lot of the reporting focuses on iPhones, but that’s only because they’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;proven easier to analyze&lt;/a&gt; for signs of a Pegasus infection than Android phones have. Pegasus can, however, infect both, according to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;an NSO informational document&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/21/why-apples-walled-garden-is-no-match-for-pegasus-spyware"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have commented on the situation, with Apple condemning attacks against journalists and activists, and Google saying that it warns users of attempted infiltrations, even those backed by governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pzYh5x"&gt;I think I’ve heard of Pegasus before?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="o0JeuY"&gt;The spyware has been in the news for years, often in connection with incidents similar to what’s currently being reported. In 2017, reports surfaced that the software had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15828934/spyware-nso-group-mexico-journalists-activists-citizen-lab"&gt;been used in attacks against Mexican reporters and activists&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20938676/whatsapp-nso-group-spyware-hack-encrypted-chat-lawsuit"&gt;sued NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the software developer was involved in the hacking of around 1,400 devices using an exploit found in WhatsApp’s code. Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and other tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22194930/microsoft-google-cisco-vmware-internet-association-amicus-brief-nso-group-spyware-whatsapp-facebook"&gt;signaled support&lt;/a&gt; for WhatsApp’s suit. (As of April 2021, the case was ongoing, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/12/nso-falters-lawsuit-whatsapp-hacking-481073"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDw84P"&gt;In 2020, it was reported that NSO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117180/fbi-bezos-hack-amazon-saudi-arabia-nso"&gt;was being investigated by the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, in connection with the 2018 hack of Jeff Bezos’ cellphone. At the time, NSO denied knowledge of the FBI’s probe, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-nso-exclusive/exclusive-fbi-probes-use-of-israeli-firms-spyware-in-personal-and-government-hacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZT38B"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the FBI recently &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/nso-business-us/"&gt;declined to comment about the matter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ABULcc"&gt;Who’s behind the targeting of activists and journalists?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="7oE3uZ"&gt;We don’t know at the moment, but it’s likely not just one government agency or country. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;points to a list of 10 countries&lt;/a&gt; where many of the phone numbers on the list seem to be from, and says that those countries have been reported to have worked with NSO in the past. But the fact that many of the basic facts about the list remain disputed means there’s really not enough information to draw solid conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="2ePUk2"&gt;How much does it cost to spy on a phone?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6oaDe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NSO reportedly provides bulk discounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuZi5"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/technology/nso-group-how-spy-tech-firms-let-governments-see-everything-on-a-smartphone.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that NSO Group charged $500,000 to set a client up with the Pegasus system, and then charged an additional fee to actually infiltrate people’s phones. At the time, the costs were reportedly $650,000 to hack 10 iPhone or Android users, or $500,000 to infiltrate five BlackBerry users. Clients could then pay more to target additional users, saving as they spy with bulk discounts: $800,000 for an additional 100 phones, $500,000 for an extra 50 phones, and so on. NSO would also reportedly charge 17 percent of what the clients had paid over the course of a year as an annual maintenance fee. &lt;a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/"&gt;According to Forbidden Stories&lt;/a&gt;, NSO’s contract with Saudi Arabia alone is worth up to $55 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tSHBVU"&gt;What does NSO say about the reports?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="e4gW0C"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NSO Group’s CEO and co-founder Shalev Hulio broadly denied the allegations, claiming that the list of numbers had nothing to do with Pegasus or NSO. He argued that a list of phone numbers targeted by Pegasus (which NSO &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/18/reactions-pegasus-project-nso/"&gt;says it doesn’t keep&lt;/a&gt;, as it has “no insight” into what investigations are being carried out by its clients) would be much shorter — he told &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt; that NSO’s 45 clients average about 100 Pegasus targets per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0vw0rI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Somebody has to do the dirty work”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYNqtI"&gt;Hulio also claims that NSO has investigated its clients’ use of the software, and hasn’t found evidence that they targeted any of the phone numbers NSO had been given, including the one linked to Khashoggi’s wife. He also says that it’s NSO policy to cut off clients’ access to Pegasus if it discovers that they are using the system outside of its intended use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFz4Sq"&gt;Hulio &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/18/reactions-pegasus-project-nso/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the reports were “concerning,” and that the company would investigate. He told &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt; that NSO had been running checks with present and past clients for the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="wNavpp"&gt;How would NSO know whether these people have been targeted, or keep them from being targeted, if it has no idea who its clients are targeting?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cHeUMq"&gt;Great question. Hulio tries to answer it &lt;a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3912882,00.html"&gt;in his interview with &lt;em&gt;Calcalist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mentioning an ability to analyze a client’s systems, but doesn’t really provide enough detail to be reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7JMWHE"&gt;Also, how does Hulio’s claim of Pegasus clients having an average of 100 targets a year square with the bulk discounts NSO reportedly provides?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="7K8vJM"&gt;Again, great question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vvdyaj"&gt;Why make software like this? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qNTWhb"&gt;According to NSO, it builds Pegasus solely for use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/"&gt;reportedly only sells the software&lt;/a&gt; to specific government agencies that have been approved by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hIIVi"&gt;NSO seems to see its software as a necessary, if unpleasant, part of modern surveillance, with its CEO &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “somebody has to do the dirty work” and that Pegasus is “used to handle literally the worst this planet has to offer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="u5UieI"&gt;Are there other companies out there making tools like Pegasus?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ANh1bh"&gt;Absolutely. &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/spyware-for-sale-the-booming-trade-in-surveillance-tech-like-pegasus/articleshow/84648872.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economic Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a good rundown of some of the higher-profile companies working in the space, along with an explanation of how the pattern of Israeli cyberintelligence agents leaving military service and founding startups leads to Israel being the home of many of these companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="adfVTt"&gt;What can I do to keep myself safe and my information private?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="J9A4Ep"&gt;Despite Amnesty’s report that versions of iOS from July are vulnerable to Pegasus, keeping your phone up to date will ensure that your phone is susceptible to fewer exploits, as updates are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417984/ios-14-5-1-ipad-iphone-apple-watch-mac-update-security-fix"&gt;continually patched out by phone manufacturers.&lt;/a&gt; There’s also the standard set of security best practices: using strong, unique passwords (preferably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;with a password manager&lt;/a&gt;), turning on encryption, not clicking on links from strangers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxYjEr"&gt;Of course, Pegasus has been shown to bypass most of these security measures — a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4599753-NSO-Pegasus.html"&gt;leaked copy of NSO informational material&lt;/a&gt; brags that installation “cannot be prevented by the target” — but they will help protect you from less sophisticated hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sa9LQ7"&gt;How can I check if my phone was compromised? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3DHmg1"&gt;Amnesty International has actually released a tool that can be used for analysis, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587234/amnesty-international-nso-pegasus-spyware-detection-tool-ios-android-guide-windows-mac"&gt;read our guide on how to use it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="naSvZy"&gt;How worried should I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; be?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="oTxWhA"&gt;Assuming you’re not a journalist working on sensitive stories, a world leader, or in some position that could threaten governmental powers, the odds are that someone hasn’t paid thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to target you with Pegasus. That said, it’s obviously concerning that these types of attacks are possible, and that they could potentially fall into the hands of hackers looking to target a much broader range of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZO0N8"&gt;As with all security-related measures, it’s important to be realistic about the threats that you’re facing, and what you should do about them. For most people who aren’t likely to be targeted by an actor on the level of a nation-state (which hopefully includes you), the bigger threat to privacy comes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"&gt;data brokers&lt;/a&gt;, which operate legally and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;at a larger scale&lt;/a&gt;. On the flip side, if you actually &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;being targeted by governments, with all the resources at their disposal, there’s probably not a whole lot you can do to keep your digital data private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1vhNbX"&gt;I’ve heard the software can’t be used against people with +1 country code numbers, like those found in the US or Canada.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="OQJB3G"&gt;NSO has claimed many times that the software is technically incapable of targeting phones with US +1 phone numbers. This, of course, doesn’t protect &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/19/us-phone-numbers-nso/"&gt;Americans who are using international phone numbers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also something that’s hard for the company to actually prove. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the investigation didn’t find evidence that any American numbers had been hacked, but they only checked 67 phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYK8pg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes#Zone_1:_North_American_Numbering_Plan"&gt;rest of the countries&lt;/a&gt; using the +1 code at the start of their phone numbers, such as Canada, Jamaica, and others, are largely unmentioned in the new wave of NSO reporting, though Canada was mentioned &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/"&gt;in a 2018 report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Europa Clipper will fly on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nb1BN1zYIfOZVCUuPBu-8Pbt2x0=/0x892:8352x6460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624179/PIA20025_orig.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y82nJ5"&gt;NASA’s &lt;a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/"&gt;Europa Clipper&lt;/a&gt; will start its journey to Jupiter’s icy moon aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket built by SpaceX. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-the-europa-clipper-mission"&gt;NASA will pay SpaceX $178 million&lt;/a&gt; to launch the vehicle in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXHqTs"&gt;The Europa Clipper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/18/8803679/NASA-Europa-clipper-mission-development-phase"&gt;got the green light from NASA in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. It will fly by the moon 45 times, providing researchers with a tantalizing look at the icy world, believed to have an ocean lurking under its icy crust. The Clipper is equipped with instruments that will help scientists figure out if the moon could support life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx9QMy"&gt;For years, the Clipper was legally obligated to launch on NASA’s long-delayed Space Launch System (SLS). But with the SLS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;perpetually delayed and over budget&lt;/a&gt;, NASA has urged Congress to consider allowing the Europa Clipper to fly commercial. Switching to another vehicle could save up to $1 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836550/nasa-europa-clipper-space-launch-system-rocket-inspector-general-falcon-heavy-delta-iv"&gt;NASA’s inspector general said in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGwnvk"&gt;NASA got permission to consider commercial alternatives to the SLS in the 2021 budget, and started officially &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-use-commercial-launch-vehicle-for-europa-clipper/"&gt;looking for a commercial alternative soon after&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUHeeL"&gt;The SLS has powerful allies in Congress, who have kept the costly program alive for years, even as it blew past budgets and deadlines. The first flight of the SLS was originally supposed to happen in 2017. That mission — launching an uncrewed trip around the Moon — has since been pushed to &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-artemis-1-sls-moon-rocket-stacked-photos"&gt;November 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and keeping to that new schedule remains “&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-administrator-bill-nelson-space-priorities"&gt;highly unlikely&lt;/a&gt;” according to NASA’s Office of Inspector General, a watchdog agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmuqJY"&gt;SpaceX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16971200/spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-success-roadster-orbit-elon-musk"&gt;first launched its Falcon Heavy rocket&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and started flying satellites in 2019. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276731/nasa-picks-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch-two-key-pieces-lunar-gateway"&gt;NASA selected the rocket&lt;/a&gt; as the ride to space for two parts of a planned space station orbiting the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvSEh8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian raises another $2.5 billion as it looks to build a second factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/erm7xAkzk87V6T4xwKsMHt-F70E=/0x1:2879x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69624133/rivian_r1t_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkOa1w"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Rivian has raised another massive round of funding, this time to the tune of $2.5 billion, bringing its total raised to date over the $10 billion mark. The funding round comes as Rivian recently confirmed it’s looking for a location to build a second factory — one that will also produce batteries for its vehicles — in the United States. The company is currently aiming to roll its first electric pickup trucks off the line at its existing factory in Illinois this September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsnBtD"&gt;The new round was led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Ford, D1 Capital Partners, and funds advised by T. Rowe Price, each of which are already investors in Rivian. Amazon and Ford each own &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;more than 10 percent of the buzzy EV startup&lt;/a&gt;, and are working with Rivian on separate vehicles: Rivian is building delivery vans for Amazon, and is developing a vehicle with Ford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOPlpg"&gt;Rivian was supposed to put its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV into production in 2020, but delayed to 2021 after the pandemic hit. A targeted June start date for pickup production slipped to July, before getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;delayed again until September&lt;/a&gt;. The SUV will now enter production sometime soon after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zubpw5"&gt;As if getting three vehicles into production (not including the one with Ford, which is still in development) at roughly the same time isn’t challenging or expensive enough, Rivian confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;this week that it’s scouting locations for a second assembly plant, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/rivian-us-plant/exclusive-amazon-backed-rivian-confirms-plan-for-second-u-s-assembly-plant-idUSL1N2OX2H4"&gt;where it plans to also make battery cells&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple states are bidding on the new plant, according to the report. The company now employs some 7,000 people. Rivian is also working on an initial public offering, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters?sref=DWzi38c2"&gt;multiple reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers for Google Pittsburgh contractor HCL reach tentative union contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KF4y2MO_xBj0EI8H_WiPNx3h9pE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622797/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tC3WNl"&gt;The United Steelworkers Union (USW) &lt;a href="https://www.usw.org/news/media-center/releases/2021/usws-tentative-first-contract-with-tech-firm-hcl-improves-wages-job-security"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; it has reached a tentative contract deal with a sub-contractor for Google Pittsburgh. The announcement comes almost two years after employees of engineering and IT contractor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882206/google-tech-contractors-union-vote-pittsburgh-united-steelworkers"&gt;HCL Technologies voted to unionize&lt;/a&gt;, saying that even though they worked alongside Google employees, they didn’t receive the same benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtTx5"&gt;Amanda Parks, a member of the USW bargaining committee who works at HCL, said in a statement that the proposed three-year contract includes “meaningful wage increases” and addresses pay parity concerns. It includes language that offers job security and additional time off, according to the statement. “We work hard, and we deserve what all workers deserve, an agreement that reflects our important contributions to the company’s success,” Parks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35BZRk"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509201/google-union-nlrb-hcl-america-offshoring-pittsburgh-organizing"&gt;filed a complaint against HCL&lt;/a&gt; in October, claiming that the company was outsourcing the Pittsburgh workers’ jobs in retaliation for union activity. According to the complaint, HCL failed to bargain with the Pittsburgh workers and transferred their work to offshore workers in Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcfmZy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;Google’s contractor workforce&lt;/a&gt; has grown significantly over the past several years, to the point it’s nearly as large as its full-time workforce, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1FO3L"&gt;The tentative contract covers about 65 employees based in Pittsburgh and is scheduled for a ratification vote on July 30th. The contract would take effect immediately if it is ratified, the union said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlkPwm"&gt;A spokesperson for HCL confirmed the tentative agreement in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday. “Throughout this process, HCL has been actively engaged in meaningful and fair discussions with the USW in good faith,” the spokesperson said. “We have been steadfast in our commitment to respect our employees’ right to pursue unionization should they choose to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGkleH"&gt;Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OGnWl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 23rd 3:31PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from HCL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max will release 10 Warner Bros. films straight-to-streaming in 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUuoTO"&gt;After deciding to release its full slate of 2021 Warner Bros. films on HBO Max under a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;hybrid streaming and theatrical model&lt;/a&gt;, it appears WarnerMedia is prepared to continue using its Warner Bros. assets to lure subscribers to the service in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOVswX"&gt;During AT&amp;amp;T’s second-quarter earnings call this week, the company’s executives were asked about how the pandemic release model would shape a more permanent release strategy going forward, particularly as it relates to theaters. Citing the theatrical success of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; to the tune of $463 million in revenue, WarnerMedia chief Jason Kilar responded that while “the motion picture format absolutely matters,” the company also feels “very good about the response that consumers have given it in the home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4cdiy"&gt;Kilar went on to say that Warner Bros. will be producing 10 films that will debut on HBO Max the same day they’re released. While it’s not clear which titles these 10 will include, the decision indicates that pandemic has significantly influenced the way that WarnerMedia will tackle its movie releases moving forward. Kilar expressly stated that the company does not plan to return to a film release strategy of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eVkPb"&gt;“I certainly don’t anticipate us going back to the way the world was in 2015 or ’16 or ’17, where windows were quite lengthy between theatrical and home exhibition, whether it was an a la carte transaction or something else,” Kilar said. As previously announced &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/cineworld-regal-warner-bros-deal-theatrical-windows-us-cinemas-reopening-1234719255/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; when Warner Bros. reached a multi-year agreement with Cineworld for 2021 and 2022 film exhibition, Kilar confirmed that theatrical windows for “a portion of our slate” would be 45 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPlqNK"&gt;WarnerMedia faced significant backlash when it announced earlier this year that its 2021 slate of films would debut under its same-day streaming and theatrical release model. Theaters were &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amc-is-pissed-1845804062"&gt;not especially pleased&lt;/a&gt;, but the strategy was also criticized by creators themselves, including directors &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/wb-hbo-max-directors-criticism-nolan-misses-point/"&gt;Christopher Nolan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/denise-villeneuve-judd-apatow-hbo-max-warner-bros.html"&gt;Denis Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt;. During the earnings call, Kilar said the industry would continue to “evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtdKj1"&gt;“I think that what you’re going to see is this industry continue to evolve and to continue to innovate in ways that not only works for consumers and fans, but also works for our business partners,” Kilar said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iDOS 2 emulator gets App Store takedown notice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ThwAhJXfUc8_F8wPgMVS4rjhlE=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623799/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sXrrZo"&gt;Apple may be removing &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/idos-2/id918131840"&gt;iDOS 2&lt;/a&gt;, a popular (or, at the very least, popular for a DOS emulator designed to run decades-old software and games) emulation app that allows users to run DOS games and software on Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYifKw"&gt;According to the developer, &lt;a href="https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone"&gt;Chaoji Li&lt;/a&gt;, Apple issued the notice of the pending takedown after a recently submitted update for a bug fix. While iDOS 2 has been available since 2014 on the App Store, it seems that with the most recent update, the company has changed its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu4IOM"&gt;Per the letter that Li received: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3ipJ2B"&gt;Upon re-evaluation, we found that your app is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. Specifically, we found your app is in violation of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfvJkd"&gt;Guideline 2.5.2 — Performance — Software Requirements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoIXfN"&gt; During review, your app installed or launched executable code, which is not permitted on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13pbDM"&gt;Specifically, your app executes iDOS package and image files and allows iTunes File Sharing and Files support for importing games. Executing code can introduce or changes features or functionality of the app and allows for downloading of content without licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mPT4QF"&gt;Li had previously been forced to go four years without an update to iDOS 2 due to Apple’s restrictions on bundling game files, but he &lt;a href="https://litchie.com/2020/09/idos2-update"&gt;was able to update the app&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020 with changes that enabled iDOS 2 to use iOS’s document-sharing feature to let users import their own files. An earlier version of the app, iDOS, had been briefly available on the App Store in 2010, but &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/26/idos-emulator-supports-dos-and-windows-3-0-on-ios-devices/"&gt;was pulled&lt;/a&gt; by Apple shortly after it was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppCEJu"&gt;Since that September update, Li was also able to submit a dozen other updates to his app, each without issue. Li claims to have been extremely upfront with Apple’s reviewers during each update submission, noting that while the app does run external code, it does so in a sandboxed environment (meaning there’s no security risk that could compromise user data on the rest of the operating system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iO9Fw6"&gt;For whatever reason, though, Apple appears to have changed its mind on enforcing this section of its App Store rules. It’s not clear what exactly has changed here, although Li speculates that a recent burst of popularity (helped by tweets from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1409191922682400770"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; tech editor Harry McCracken&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/739100/how-to-install-windows-31-on-an-ipad/"&gt;guide from &lt;em&gt;How-To Geek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that shows how the app could be used to run Windows 3.1 on an iPad) may have caused Apple’s change of heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxVcHe"&gt;Apple has given Li 14 days to update his app to remove the ability to run executable code — which would render it completely useless. Li has already said he doesn’t intend to make that change, explaining that doing so “would be a betrayal to all the users that have purchased this app specifically for those features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf9nGz"&gt;For now, iDOS 2 is still available on the App Store for $4.99, but if Apple sticks to its word, it likely won’t be around to purchase for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8chx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ha5fHi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A missing ampersand locked some users out of their Chromebooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 open, seen from the back, on a stone bench." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXDRiwpfv85VTWkhcOFJ2Ka1IGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623430/mchin_20190722_4563_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFdF3X"&gt;A major bug in a recent Chrome OS release (91.0.4472.147) left some users bricked out of their Chromebooks. Reddit, in due course, has already spotted the issue. As some eagle-eyed users, including one “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/onlcus/update_it_seems_google_has_pulled_the_165_stable/h5vgtxu/?context=8&amp;amp;depth=9"&gt;elitist_ferret&lt;/a&gt;” (first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/20/a-new-chrome-os-91-update-is-breaking-chromebooks-like-a-bull-in-a-china-shop/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;),&lt;/em&gt; have pointed out, the problem appears to boil down to a missing ampersand in Google’s code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBBvwE"&gt;Specifically, it seems that Google used one “&amp;amp;” in a conditional statement in its Cryptohome VaultKeyset, rather than two “&amp;amp;&amp;amp;”, which is the “AND” operator in C++, breaking up the line. The mishap prevented Chrome OS from checking user passwords against stored keys, as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/google-pushed-a-one-character-typo-to-production-bricking-chrome-os-devices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, and that left some users unable to log in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMfari"&gt;Google has not yet responded to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85Px6B"&gt;The Chrome OS subreddit was aware of the bug in 91.0.4472.147 as early as the afternoon of July 19th. “The latest stable update is stopping users from logging in,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/oniply/warning_the_latest_stable_update_is_stopping/"&gt;one user wrote&lt;/a&gt; at 1:23PM ET. “We recommend that you DO NOT update until further notice.” A number of users also began &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/oniply/warning_the_latest_stable_update_is_stopping/h5ryqx0/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reporting bugs&lt;/a&gt; around that time — some complained that their devices wouldn’t accept their passwords, while others said they couldn’t even get past the boot-up screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5l2q8R"&gt;Google said that evening on its &lt;a href="https://support.cloud.google.com/portal/system-status?start_time=1626753600000"&gt;Customer Care Portal&lt;/a&gt; that a solution would be deployed by the end of the day on July 21st, and recommended that users powerwash their devices, roll back to previous Chrome OS builds, log in with Guest Mode, or wait for the fix. By the next day, the company had identified the issue with the new build and had halted its rollout. On the 21st, it noted that a new version (91.0.4472.167) was being rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3hFPl"&gt;“The rollout will gradually release to devices over the next few days,” the update reads. “Affected devices can login via Guest Mode or an account that hasn’t signed into the device.” Once affected users have successfully signed in, they can follow the steps in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/177889?hl=en"&gt;Google’s Help Center&lt;/a&gt; to download the latest update. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram users worry a new sensitivity filter is censoring their work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQlH1KUnpqHlmLTx7kR09eYfnGY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623083/acastro_210723_4678_instagramContent_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro &amp;amp; Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But Instagram downplays the changes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qi5ZZ1"&gt;Instagram users around the platform share one central concern right now: that the app’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585623/instagram-sensitive-content-control-setting-explore-tab-limit-offensive-posts"&gt;sensitive content filter&lt;/a&gt; is blocking their posts. In posts on both the feed and in Stories, account holders are warning their followers that the setting is limiting their reach and that their followers should disable the filter to ensure their posts get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajZ68h"&gt;“Over the past 24 hours, I’ve had many conversations with artists and other creators who are incredibly frustrated by having their work hidden,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/phillip.miner/"&gt;Phillip Miner&lt;/a&gt;, an artist and the creator of queer hobby magazine &lt;em&gt;Natural Pursuits&lt;/em&gt;, wrote in a post. “Conversely, people are frustrated that they can’t find the content the want to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWjWwV"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRmaR0Uh637/"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; of his alerting people to the filter has reached over 700,000 people and has been shared 192,000 times as of this morning, he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. People from all sorts of communities, including the art world, sex workers, tattoo artists, and the cannabis industry have picked up on it, sharing similar concerns, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="BGLh5P"&gt;

&lt;p id="jL0WsU"&gt;An account for a gun holster company makes a similar warning in its own post, saying  content about “guns” and “capitalism” might be hidden. If there’s a unifying cause on Instagram right now, it’s around the sensitivity filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A43J1Y"&gt;The sensitivity filter, which was introduced Tuesday, allows people to set limits around how much potentially sensitive content they might see on their Explore page. It’s supposed to filter out things like self-harm content, and it’s turned on by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrbO4J"&gt;But Instagram says that creators shouldn’t worry. The app already limited the amount of sensitive content people see on their Explore page, and the default setting retains that filtering. With the options introduced Tuesday, people can now either further limit sensitive content or allow more of it to surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvmP1A"&gt;A spokesperson suggests to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some users could even see a bump in discoverability because of this change if people opt into allowing more sensitive content on their Explore page. The change will have “no impact” on what users see in their feed or in Stories, “where we will continue showing them posts from people they follow,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri2T57"&gt;Sensitive content is defined by Instagram in its “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232"&gt;Recommendation Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;,” which only pertains to content that is recommended in places like Explore and IGTV Discover and is much broader than its “Community Guidelines.” Content that is considered sensitive is still allowed on the app, as opposed to content that violates its Community Guidelines, but Instagram might surface it less frequently, particularly for users who set their sensitivity limits to the lowest level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibr3UO"&gt;A spokesperson didn’t offer specifics around how much sensitive content users could expect to see in their Explore page at any of the three available settings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AHKvfA"&gt;Miner points out, however, that regardless of the filter, bucketing all sensitive content under one broad phrase is the bigger issue. His work often shows nudity, for example, which, if sexually explicit or suggestive, is considered sensitive by Instagram, but he says some people might be okay with nude art while also not wanting to see content that depicts violence, which also falls under sensitive content. The same could be said of tobacco-related content or content related to pharmaceutical drugs, both of which are considered sensitive content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxoMMs"&gt;“What I would love to see is, there’s so much that falls under the umbrella of sensitive content, being able to tailor your experience more,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="S9voUe"&gt;Instagram clearly attempted to give people more control, but it stayed too broad, at least in Miner’s opinion. The platform also isn’t clear with people who want to disable the filter as to whether they’ll suddenly see lots of unwanted weight loss content or violent images. Though ultimately much of Instagram won’t change with this new setting, the communication about it should.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite turns monster battles into a team sport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-Xyh3SynIjahy1s396GuFDs4kQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623068/Pokemon_UNITE___Team_Up._Take_Down.___Hero_Image___1080p.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNDqmh"&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; are massively popular, and have been for the better part of a decade. But they can also be impenetrable to new players and viewers: there are so many characters and strategies that figuring out what’s happening on-screen is a huge challenge. The just-launched &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; aims to fix that. It doesn’t just add cute monsters to the genre, but also some clever fixes to streamline it and make things more approachable. It’s kind of like a mashup of a strategy game and basketball, but with a Gengar thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5VkaP"&gt;For the uninitiated, a MOBA — or multiplayer online battle arena, to use the genre’s unnecessarily long full name — is a five-on-five competition where the goal, usually, is to destroy the opposing team’s base. You do this by forming a squad of characters, each with their own unique abilities, which you use to steadily destroy towers and level up so you can push your way into your opponent’s territory. It’s often slow and methodical, a genre that rewards smart decisions as well as quick reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HE7jzq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; has many of these elements, including a varied cast of monsters to choose from. Charmander is a good all-around melee fighter, for instance, while Venasaur is better for ranged attacks. There are support characters and ones designed for defense. In a nice twist, many of the creatures will evolve over the course of the match. It’s fun starting out as a squat little Gible and ending the match as an imposing Garchomp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xSerpB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j86TTIMWBYY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pAtyYq"&gt;But the most interesting aspects of &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; are where it differs from the traditional MOBA. For starters, instead of trying to destroy your opponents’ base, you’re scoring points. To do this, you have to defeat wild pokémon that spawn throughout the arena to earn points, which you then take to one of the opponent’s goal circles to score. Drop enough points to destroy a circle and you can move on to the next. It’s similar to how MOBAs usually work, but it’s also a lot simpler to understand. And the system also adds some new drama: if you’re killed, you’ll lose a big chunk of the points you’re holding, which makes things very tense if you have a lot stacked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bly9x4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"League of Legends: Wild Rift makes one of the world’s biggest games more accessible","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc76u1"&gt;The other nice thing about the game is that it has a strict time limit. Whereas a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; match can stretch to close to an hour if it’s tightly contested, a single &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; match takes exactly 10 minutes. Once the timer runs down, whichever team has the most points wins. (Some matches can actually be shorter; I’ve already played a few where the other team forfeited early because of a lopsided score.) The time limit and points system make &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; feel a bit more like a virtual sport, albeit one with experience points and spawning monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hud93p"&gt;This idea of streamlining a MOBA isn’t exactly new. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/3/8712733/heroes-of-the-storm-review"&gt;Blizzard tried it with &lt;em&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Riot did something similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;when it brought &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; to mobile with the spinoff &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But, at least from what I’ve played so far, &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; seems the most approachable. The rules are easy to understand, the matches are short and intense, and the world is already something millions of people know and love. So far, the only real issue I’ve run into is the copious amounts of virtual currency you can earn or buy. It gets weirdly complicated, to the point that you can spend as much time messing around in battle pass menus as actually playing the game. It doesn’t seem like you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to buy anything, but some of the fashion options are pretty tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1m6gK"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; is available as a free download on the Nintendo Switch, but it’s poised to become even bigger when it debuts on mobile in September (with crossplay and cross progression at launch). Developer TiMi, an internal studio at Tencent, already operates two of the biggest games in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22340775/honor-of-kings-burberry-skin-fashion-video-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The combination of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; and MOBA could soon add a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5Yymh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
