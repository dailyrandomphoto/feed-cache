    <title>Microsoft Surface Pro 7 vs. Pro 8: what’s the difference?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Pro 8" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqEb0014hwtFyZeJ51E7dAXMXLM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927362/bfarsace_210921_4770_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pro 8 offers Thunderbolt 4 support, a 120Hz display, a better camera, more storage, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aRBaAl"&gt;During its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;recent Surface event&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft launched the largest upgrade of its flagship Intel-powered Surface Pro lineup in years: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;. The new 2-in-1 machine boasts a 120Hz display, Thunderbolt 4 support, and new processors, but all of those improvements come at a cost — literally. Whereas the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeMicrosoftSurfaceReview&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3Fcrosssellid%3D%26selectedColor%3D86888a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro 7 starts at $549.99&lt;/a&gt;, the Surface Pro 8 starts at $1,099.99, meaning it’s nearly double the price. And that’s also before you factor in the cost of Microsoft’s new stylus and detachable keyboard, two add-ons that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688403/surface-pro-8-duo-studio-x-go-true-price-keyboard-pen-stylus-bundle"&gt;more like necessities&lt;/a&gt; if you intend to use the 2-in-1 as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3RXHP"&gt;With all that said, is it worth upgrading or picking up the Pro 8 over the last-gen model when it launches on October 5th? To help make your decision a little easier, we’ve put together the comparison below based on specs and our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;initial impressions of the Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bRdkia"&gt;What’s improved on the Surface Pro 8?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PZOp5K"&gt;Two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C8O1SQ"&gt;You can double the refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cIGutN"&gt;11th-gen Intel quad-core Core CPUs, starting with i5 instead of i3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dNd01o"&gt;10MP rear-facing camera, with 1080p and 4K video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fHHsMg"&gt;Larger, 13-inch display with higher 2880 x 1920 resolution (up from 12.3-inch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EQHexv"&gt;Double the RAM on the base model (8GB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pLeX2a"&gt;Microsoft says the battery should last up to 16 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B1X1vQ"&gt;New sensor that adjusts the display temperature based on ambient lighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3URsFf"&gt;LTE support for enterprise users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="26BwNl"&gt;Preloaded with Windows 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="DHULZd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UtWO1X"&gt;The Surface Pro 8 is more than just an incremental update. Microsoft’s newest slate features a modernized look with slimmer bezels, making it the Surface Pro’s largest visual redesign in years. Like the Surface Pro X, the Surface Pro 8 features a 13-inch display as opposed to the 12.3-inch found on the Pro 7. In his recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;hands-on take&lt;/a&gt;, my colleague Dieter Bohn also remarked that the Pro 8 feels slightly nicer to hold, given the corners are softer. And if color matters to you, the touchscreen machine is also now available in graphite instead of black, which is a colorway still available for the Pro 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4asgn"&gt;Spec-wise, the display on the Pro 8 is significantly better compared to its predecessor, given there’s now an option to ramp up the refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz, which could improve scrolling and make using the stylus easier. Gaming could certainly be more enjoyable on the Pro 8, too, especially given the device comes preloaded with the Xbox app and a one-month trial of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. In addition, the latest Pro supports Dolby Vision and is the first Surface device to come with an ambient color sensor, which automatically adjusts the display’s color temperature and brightness based on the surrounding lighting conditions. The new Pro 8 also boasts a 3:2 display and 2880 x 1920 pixels as opposed to 2736 x 1824, although, technically, both share the same 267 pixels per inch. Regardless, the expanded size still offers you a little more space for, say, multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3hC5yr_1Au32B8HK7Bk42n5aGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869371/Surface_Pro_8_with_Type_Cover_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Pro 8 is equipped with a larger, 13-inch touchscreen and narrower bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a0yIxA"&gt;The Pro 8 also appears to be superior to the Pro 7 when it comes to performance and battery life. The new 2-in-1 is available with either a quad-core, 11th-gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor, and with up to 32GB of RAM. The Pro 8 also comes with a removable SSD in one of four configurations: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, something you could previously only find on the Pro 7 Plus. It’s important to note, however, that Microsoft says the SSD should be repaired or replaced by a trained Microsoft-authorized technician — they’re “not user removable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36q2k0"&gt;The Pro 7, meanwhile, comes with a dual-core, 10th-gen Intel Core i3 or a quad-core, 10th-gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7, and with up to 16GB of RAM. It’s available in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities. Overall, Microsoft says the Surface Pro 8 shows a 40 percent improvement over the Pro 7 when it comes to sustained CPU performance; it’s also 74 percent faster on the graphics side, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jruzF"&gt;Battery life on the Pro 8 is, at least on paper, greater as well, with Microsoft claiming it can last up to 16 hours on a single charge. The tech giant also says it can charge from 0 to 80 percent in a little over an hour. The Pro 7 was supposed to last up to 10.5 hours on a charge in comparison, though, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted it lasted 7-8 hours or less when working with graphically intensive apps and pages. We don’t expect Microsoft’s battery claims regarding the Pro 8 to hold up in real-world usage, though, especially with a 120Hz display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-qvCkiEhAqkEFB0QGCvdKoMsfCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249911/akrales_190930_3688_0218.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last-gen Surface Pro 7 features older, 10th-gen Intel processors and lacks Thunderbolt ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0JQbpg"&gt;The Pro 8 additionally stands out in some ways when it comes to connectivity, depending on your needs. Instead of a USB-A port and the integrated microSD card slot featured on the Pro 7, Microsoft went with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, allowing the tablet to support either two 4K displays with a 60Hz refresh rate or a single 8K monitor at 30Hz. The Core i3 and Core i7 models can also be configured with LTE, though the feature is only available to enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMaPit"&gt;The Pro also boasts better cameras than its successor. The new model’s rear camera is a 10MP shooter as opposed to an 8MP, and the rear camera on the Pro 8 can also capture 4K video. The Pro 8’s new face-tracking tech could also improve video calls by keeping you in focus while you walk around and talk. Microsoft says the Windows Hello camera has been upgraded, too, and it pairs with Microsoft Studio mics for audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Slim Pen 2 with haptic feedback." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/se8t99tuv1LBp3-Wy3WLuwzrBdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868461/bfarsace_210921_4770_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Surface Slim Pen 2 comes with haptic engines for a smoother inking experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zlOAjT"&gt;Unsurprisingly, Microsoft also improved the Pro 8’s optional accessories. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;new Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt; ($129.99) features a sharper tip that allows for better precision and a built-in haptic motor, which helps the stylus better emulate the feeling of writing on paper and makes for a smoother inking experience. You can also charge the pen inductively when you’re not using it via the built-in slot on the detachable Surface Pro Signature Keyboard ($179). The new keyboard is also stiffer thanks to a carbon-fiber core, but not heavier or thicker, which gives it less bounce when typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sELKqo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 stacks up to the Surface Laptop Studio, Go 3, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688116/surface-pro-8-go-3-laptop-studio-4-spec-gpu-power-features"},{"title":"How to preorder all of the new Surface hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683783/microsoft-surface-pro-x-8-3-go-laptop-studio-preorder-price-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="S2BoiQ"&gt;What’s the same on both models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0nX5Qm"&gt;Both share a similar, flat-edged appearance &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0bJFBR"&gt;Each has a 5MP front-facing camera for Windows Hello facial recognition that can capture video in up to 1080p&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="34qz5R"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth support &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wdze6B"&gt;Each is compatible with both generations of the Surface Slim Pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7uCRf2"&gt;Each features a built-in kickstand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SLhpzM"&gt;Both are compatible with an optional keyboard and stylus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tfMKvh"&gt;Both have a 3.5mm headphone jack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jQMX75"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9644155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N7KXsN"&gt;Besides a larger display and the new Thunderbolt 4 ports, the Surface Pro 8 is otherwise very similar physically to its predecessor. It has a rounded, flat-edged appearance, with a built-in kickstand on the back and physical buttons for volume and power. You can also use both generations of the Surface Slim Pen with either model, but note you won’t be able to enjoy the new haptic functionality afforded by the Surface Slim Pen 2 on the Pro 7. Although slightly heavier at 1.96 pounds, the Pro 8 is still light and measures less than half an inch thick, much like the Pro 7. Both also come in the platinum (read: silver) and a darker colorway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ak1WB"&gt;The front-facing camera and various wireless connectivity are also similar across devices, in addition to select ports. While the Pro 8 has a better rear camera, the 5MP front-facing camera is just like the Pro 7’s and can capture video in up to 1080p. Both models also offer dual far-field studio mics, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth support, and each comes equipped with a 3.5mm headphone jack in addition to the usual Surface Connect port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQBb4G"&gt;Finally, both offer support for Windows 11. While the latest model ships with Windows 11, Pro 7 users will be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690092/how-to-upgrade-windows-11-free-early-final-version"&gt;download the latest OS update for free&lt;/a&gt; when it releases on October 5th. This means both devices will be able to take advantage of features like the new Start menu, widgets, and the operating system’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;deeper integration with Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;. A new OS update will also bring Android apps to Windows 11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650000/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support"&gt;next year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GA6WI_hV-WzwgxNrz8x6G1ghUsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869374/Surface_Pro_8___Modes_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pro 8 is compatible with a detachable keyboard and stylus, both sold separately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="HswiAH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro 7 review: I wish this looked like a Surface Pro X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="sJqFpQ"&gt;Why you might want to buy the Pro 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gDx2yy"&gt;With a larger display, improved performance, potentially more battery life, and higher-res cameras, Microsoft’s new Surface Pro 8 looks to be a notable step up from the Surface 7 in several key ways. The Pro 8’s support for Thunderbolt also means you can connect the device to multiple monitors, enjoy faster transfer speeds, and, theoretically, use the device with an external GPU. That, along with the display’s 120Hz refresh rate, is helpful if you intend to use the tablet primarily for gaming or as a creative tool. And while the starting price is higher, you’re getting double the RAM and an i5 CPU to start, instead of an i3. If you want closer-to-comparable specs in the older Pro 7, you’re starting at $799.99 instead of $549.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8kEkJ"&gt;If you’re an enterprise customer, the Pro 8 may also be worth considering, as you’ll be able to benefit from LTE support alongside the other aforementioned perks. The LTE model isn’t available yet, however, and Microsoft says it won’t arrive until next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9c4tf"&gt;Keep in mind that this is all based on Microsoft’s provided hardware specs and our early hands-on impressions with the Pro 8. We won’t know for certain how Microsoft’s latest 2-in-1 performs until we can spend some additional time with it, so if you’re considering the Pro 8, we suggest waiting for our full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pw2K5Y"&gt;Why you may want to stick with the Pro 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="X2UUuN"&gt;If you’re on a tight budget and need a Windows tablet for casual use or everyday tasks, it may be better to stick with the Surface Pro 7. The 2-in-1 also comes with a built-in microSD card slot for transferring data and a USB-A port — a nice perk if you continue to work with older peripherals. The Pro 8 doesn’t have either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViVc6I"&gt;Given the significant improvements in its internals and display, the Pro 8 is naturally more expensive and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-8%2F8qwcrtq8v8xg%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starts at $1,099&lt;/a&gt; (without accessories). Again, you’ll also have to pay an extra $179 for the Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and $129 for the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-slim-pen-2%2F8tb9xw8rwc14%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt;, though, if you want both accessories, they’re available as a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-signature-keyboard-with-slim-pen-2%2F8vdb5vrkc5tq%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;package deal for $280&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL1zpM"&gt;In contrast, the Pro 7 is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3FselectedColor%3D86888a%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale&lt;/a&gt; starting at $549.99, while the Pro 7’s detachable &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-type-cover%2F91v4vtmhxwpm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro Type Cover keyboard&lt;/a&gt; — something the Pro 8 no longer offers, by the way — and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pen%2F92fp8q09qhxc%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pen&lt;/a&gt; start at $129.99 and $67.99, respectively. Note, as well, that keyboard covers compatible with Surface Pro 7 don’t work with the Pro 8, so you can’t buy yourself a cheaper Pro 7 one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yYlem"&gt;When you do the math, there’s still a difference of about $600 between the two, assuming you’re buying the base model of each with its accompanying keyboard and stylus. The added expense is substantial, especially if you don’t care for Thunderbolt 4, a 120Hz display, and the other, more premium features that define the Pro 8.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can finally rate Apple’s apps on the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucAA2Huwjoixhj4Wik797kZ8HK0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927350/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzwh7q"&gt;For years, Apple has let you redownload many built-in apps from the App Store that you may have deleted, but store listings for those apps had a distinct difference from others: there was no way to leave a rating or review. That appears to have changed recently, though, as you can now review Apple’s apps in the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Q3gr"&gt;In a cursory, unscientific scan of some of Apple’s apps, many of them don’t have overwhelmingly positive scores. Files, Apple Maps, and Home all had ratings between three and three-and-a-half stars. Apple News is currently sitting at 2.3 stars. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; observed&lt;/a&gt;, Podcasts has a whopping two-star rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fnx7HA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There aren’t a lot of ratings yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qWZKo6"&gt;That said, most of Apple’s apps just don’t have many ratings — many don’t break triple digits — meaning the current reviews represent an infinitesimally small sample of the huge number of iOS users who are out there. (To give you a sense of just how large the iOS ecosystem is, Apple said in January that there were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021"&gt;more than a billion iPhones in active use&lt;/a&gt;.) It also means that Apple’s apps have far fewer ratings than well-known apps like Gmail (347K), Facebook (1.1 million), and TikTok (10 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luPjyO"&gt;But even if there are only a few ratings right now, I still think the change is a good one, and I’m curious to see how ratings shake out for Apple’s apps over time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to start drafting my review of Apple Mail where I publicly beg for a built-in snooze function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WYtdd"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;These days, you have to pay for the privilege&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="usNfHq"&gt;When I watched Amazon’s press event yesterday alongside my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues, I was impressed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692147/amazon-devices-event-echo-ring-biggest-announcements"&gt;some of the new tech the company was introducing&lt;/a&gt; — but less than impressed with the way it introduced them. The deal is that, if you qualify for an “invitation,” you get the chance to buy — at a slight discount — a product that is still essentially in its beta phase. Oh, and please let Amazon know if anything goes wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo3jdm"&gt;Before I continue, a brief history: Back in 2010, I applied for a Google pilot program for a new type of computer that eventually became the Chromebook. I was delighted when I actually made it into the program — according to Wikipedia, about 60,000 people did — and I received, free of charge, a somewhat weighty, black, and rather weird Cr-48 prototype laptop loaded with the new (and, at that point, only somewhat useful) Chrome OS. It was made very clear that this unit was for testing only (although it was, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2511735/in-depth--google-s-cr-48-chrome-notebook.html"&gt;written up in many tech publications&lt;/a&gt;). Those of us who received the Cr-48 were asked to use them and report on any problems we found or any general impressions of their usefulness. The first retail Chromebooks shipped about a year and a half later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScOave"&gt;(Even after the test period was long over and much more streamlined Chromebooks were on the market, the Cr-48 machines continued to receive Chrome OS updates for several years. When they finally timed out, I rather sadly gave mine away to a friend who wanted to install Linux on it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MpsUvl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can be one of the privileged few to pay $1,000 in order to see if the Astro really works&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhgeOI"&gt;Of course, most companies don’t give out tens of thousands of test devices for free the way Google gave out the Cr-48. If a company is producing software, it may offer beta versions — usually free — to its most active users, with appropriate warnings and perhaps a discount on the final version. Hardware manufacturers usually give out pre-production units to employees, developers, bloggers, and others so that any last-minute glitches can be discovered and fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INdrZw"&gt;However, for the past few years, some vendors have been distributing what is essentially beta hardware — and asking us to pay for it. After all, why waste money giving out free hardware when your customers will pay you for the privilege?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uejWhD"&gt;Take the most recent example: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;Amazon’s new Astro “robot.”&lt;/a&gt; (I use the word “robot” with some ambivalence; as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22699916/amazon-astro-home-robot-camera-surveillance-device"&gt;some of my colleagues have commented&lt;/a&gt;, Astro is basically a camera on wheels. Of course, the debate on &lt;a href="https://robots.ieee.org/learn/what-is-a-robot/"&gt;what defines a robot&lt;/a&gt; is an old one.) Amazon seems to be wary enough of Astro’s current usefulness that it’s limiting the number of users and getting their feedback on how well it works. So it has announced that if you want this nifty new product, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698401/amazon-astro-invite-preorder-how-to-info-early-access-price"&gt;you need to apply for an invite&lt;/a&gt;. If you qualify, you can be one of the privileged few to pay $1,000 (as opposed to the $1,450 that it will cost the less adventurous masses) to see if the Astro really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ePqMo"&gt;And if it doesn’t? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Glass Enterprise Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buZt3v0gucjDimAuxRtLIHXGoVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8869777/AGCO1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: AGCO&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After crashing as a consumer item, Google Glass eventually moved to more business-centric uses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xDsJFx"&gt;Back in 2013, Google invited people to apply to try out one of its new beta projects, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates"&gt;Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike with the Cr-48, you had to pay $1,500 for the privilege. For a little while, Google’s glasses were popular in the press, as activists and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/16/4338104/congress-asks-larry-page-if-google-glass-infringes-on-privacy"&gt;even Congress&lt;/a&gt; debated the privacy implications. But eventually, the glasses were pulled back from a retail item to something manufactured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121472/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-for-sale-directly-online"&gt;for construction, medicine, and other specialized fields&lt;/a&gt;. Somewhere, there are hundreds of original Google Glasses sitting in drawers, to be occasionally pulled out and reminisced over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UPq9v"&gt;Sometimes I wonder, though: if Google had given out their Google Glass betas to a wide range of users instead of selling them to a small group of higher-income tech enthusiasts, would the outrage over the perceived privacy invasions have been quite so widespread? (Especially considering how much is recorded with our phones these days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dRqto4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10780302"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wpMZxd"&gt;Amazon seems to have developed this “pay to play” strategy into a fine art. Since September 2019, it has been allowing its customers to test its more innovative — or questionable — new equipment via a program &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21601403011"&gt;it calls Day 1 Editions&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday, along with the Astro, it added the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22695707/amazon-glow-video-chat-kids-games-price-features-release-date"&gt;Amazon Glow&lt;/a&gt;, a remote device for children that costs an “invitation-only” price of $250, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs"&gt;Ring Always Home Cam&lt;/a&gt;, a security drone that flies around your house when there’s nobody else (including pets) there. The Always Home was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;actually introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; but was apparently not ready for testing at the time. Now you can try to get an invitation, and if you’re lucky, you can test one for $250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDK1sj"&gt;If you read the intro on the Day 1 Editions page, the idea sounds very cool. “If you receive an invite,” it says, “you can purchase the product and get a chance to provide early feedback.” But you need to qualify for that invite — for example, if you want the Astro, you need to complete a survey that checks for glass mirrors or windows that extend to the floor, glass or translucent acrylic furniture, areas larger than 3,500 square feet, ramps, sunken areas, and solid black glossy flooring. That’s a possible way Amazon can potentially protect itself from negative feedback — the company can filter out any environment that it already has tagged as a possible weak point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lhrYEv"&gt;Amazon as Kickstarter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hDL22O"&gt;Of course, it could be said that what Amazon’s doing isn’t all that different from Kickstarter, where vendors ask people to help pay for the initial manufacturing run of their new product and, in return, get an early version at a lower cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q19YJm"&gt;But while Amazon has access to resources such as well-equipped and staffed development labs, funds to pay for testing, and enough employees so that new products can be distributed and tested in day-to-day circumstances, many (though, not all) of the enthusiastic vendors on Kickstarter do not. And while members of the Day 1 Editions club have nobody but themselves to blame if their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699284/amazon-astro-real-world-stairs-fragile-developer-claims-documents-tracking"&gt;new Astro falls down the stairs&lt;/a&gt;, a final Kickstarter product that is faulty will be trashed by its contributors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kspNK0"&gt;In other words, Kickstarters ain’t Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgNGWo"&gt;Now, as a Prime member from way back and the owner of at least one Echo Show display, I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the fact that Amazon is developing new products. And with any luck, Astro robots could develop into something actually useful and popular. (After all, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7167793/amazon-echo-speaker-announced"&gt;original Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; was marketed as invite-only, and look how well it’s done.) Or they could end up in the backs of closets or on the workbenches of tech enthusiasts who enjoy hacking abandoned devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTPZTB"&gt;But here’s the thing: do you really want to shell out a grand in order to be a beta tester for a big company that has nearly endless resources? That decision is essentially up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Sv7Wo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM’s new software platform will enable over-the-air updates, in-car subscriptions, and maybe facial recognition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4zmTW2KLefLb9Xr3HeKjrD-DD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927249/cadillac_2021_escalade_0422.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aCZyz"&gt;General Motors announced a new “end-to-end” software platform for its cars called “Ultifi” — a play on the name &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium&lt;/a&gt;, which is the automaker’s new electric vehicle battery architecture. GM says the new software will enable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633000/gm-ota-software-updates-digital-platform-reuss"&gt;over-the-air (OTA) updates&lt;/a&gt;, in-car subscription services, and “new opportunities to increase customer loyalty.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnIxym"&gt;The automaker envisions the new software powering everything from the mundane, like weather apps, to potentially controversial features like the use of in-car cameras for facial recognition or to detect children to automatically trigger the car’s child locks. The Linux-based system will also be available to third-party developers who may want to create apps and other features for GM customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VObWr5"&gt;GM is currently undergoing a “transformation... from an automaker to a platform innovator,” said Scott Miller, vice president of software-defined vehicles at the company. Miller said he envisions Ultifi serving the role as a “powerful hub for all the vehicle’s systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iiaOLJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM is currently undergoing a “transformation... from an automaker to a platform innovator”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nMNtGu"&gt;Ultifi will start rolling out to GM vehicles, both electric and gas-powered, in 2023, the company said. By then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;GM will have many vehicles running Google’s embedded Android Automotive operating system&lt;/a&gt;, which Miller says will work “alongside” its new Ultifi software platform in certain vehicles. Not every GM vehicle will get Android Automotive, which is supposed to start rolling out to new vehicles this year, Miller added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n06fIK"&gt;“Android Automotive is a certain subset of functionality in the car,” he said. “Ultifi is more of an umbrella overall strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TWxADy_ut67BJDGwYxEtkDWR00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888085/Ultifi_Graphic_Final.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8qrXFZ"&gt;The software will also be cloud-connected, meaning GM will be able to make decisions for the customers without their input. For example, if a vehicle’s owner left their sunroof open and weather services are predicting rain, the vehicle’s software can automatically close the sunroof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B2Czl"&gt;Ultifi isn’t only anchored to systems within the car, Miller said. GM envisions the new platform interacting with other smart devices, such as a customer’s internet-enabled thermostat or a home security system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8labMU"&gt;GM also sees the potential for in-car purchases and subscriptions as a major new source of revenue for the company. Miller used the example of Super Cruise, GM’s “hands-free” advanced driver-assist system, which is installed in some of the automaker’s vehicles today. In the future, a driver may decide they want to test out Super Cruise on an upcoming road trip. Ultifi will enable that vehicle owner to subscribe to Super Cruise for the trip and then cancel the subscription when they’ve arrived at their destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5sDF1"&gt;A more common type of subscription that GM customers will face in the future is annual or monthly fees for data storage, similar to the fees that Apple and Google charge to their smartphone customers today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tcWCMr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A more common type of subscription that GM customers will face in the future is annual or monthly fees for data storage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dG5P5P"&gt;GM isn’t the only automaker contemplating new ways to squeeze money out of its customers beyond the sale of its vehicle. Much like the tech sector, which over the years has figured out how a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18522990/recurring-revenue-gadgets-hardware-profit-subscription"&gt;recurring revenue model&lt;/a&gt; allows them to rely on customers paying every month or year, automakers are increasingly turning to subscriptions and in-car fees to bring in more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2dCVy"&gt;Cars are more full of computers and software than ever before, which has made it possible for automakers to add new features or patch problems on the fly with over-the-air software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NScRU"&gt;Automakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/24/3385506/tesla-model-s-over-the-air-car-firmware-update"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311332/bmw-in-car-purchase-heated-seats-software-over-the-air-updates"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; have proven that some customers are willing to pay to unlock certain vehicle features, like improved infotainment experiences or even longer range in their electric vehicles. Ford has said that its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303479/ford-2021-f-150-active-drive-assist-hybrid-specs-features-photos"&gt;2021 F-150 will have over-the-air updates&lt;/a&gt; that cover the car from “bumper to bumper,” which could theoretically allow the company to charge for access to certain features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCpydo"&gt;It’s also proven to be risky business, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995630/bmw-apple-carplay-reverse-decision-annual-fee-vehicle"&gt;BMW ultimately reversing its controversial decision&lt;/a&gt; to charge customers an annual fee to use Apple’s CarPlay, which is free in most cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeHKYZ"&gt;Miller said GM is aware that too many subscriptions and fees can have the effect of repelling customers rather than keeping them loyal. “It has to be a win-win proposition for the customer and for us,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can charge your iPhone 13 Pro Max much faster with the right power brick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OnfHZ51hQMWJc91fwiQdne0eQIE=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927111/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="text-container"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro Max can charge a bit faster than other models, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byIt3SmVfyg"&gt;according to tests done by YouTuber ChargerLAB&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1441706758607552518"&gt;backed up&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/785/785771.htm"&gt;other tests&lt;/a&gt;), which show that the phone sips up to 27 watts of power when plugged into a compatible charging brick. If you have a 13 Pro Max and want to fill up its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;massive battery&lt;/a&gt; as fast as possible, you may want to look into getting a 30W charger that, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205"&gt;tests cited by @duanrui1205&lt;/a&gt;, can charge it from zero to full in less than 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__aifbjt1xnnj"&gt;This appears to be an upgrade from the previous generation — &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/02/what-can-i-use-to-charge-iphone-12/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 12 caps out at around 22W charging speeds. That’s about a 5W boost, which is nothing to sneeze at. The benefit of a bigger charger is limited to the Pro Max, according to @duanrui1205, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1442424092238352396?s=20"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt; that the smaller iPhone 13 Pro could only charge at 20W. All of this goes out the window if you’re charging wirelessly or with Apple’s MagSafe puck — you’ll&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"&gt; be limited to 15W at most&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyzvo0"&gt;If you’re looking for a 30W brick to charge your Pro Max a bit faster, it’s probably worth looking around your house first: Apple includes 30W chargers with its new MacBook Air, and the 61W charger that comes with MacBook Pros could also provide the 27 watts your phone craves. You can check any other chargers in your house by reading the regulatory text that’s usually printed near the prongs — if it doesn’t outright say the wattage, you can figure it out by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Overview"&gt;multiplying the amps and voltage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nMrhUB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10780536"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ADsxCo"&gt;If your search for a 30W charger didn’t turn up anything, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMY1W2AM%2FA%2F30w-usb-c-power-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22700491%2Fiphone-13-pro-max-faster-charge-times-27w-charging-brick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple will happily sell you one&lt;/a&gt;. You can also find plenty of third-party ones, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-Compact-Foldable/dp/B091DS2M8X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s tiny Nano II GaN brick&lt;/a&gt;. One thing to note when looking at chargers is the charge rates they support — to get the 27W charging, the iPhone is looking for 9V at three amps, according to ChargerLAB’s video (which shows one 30W charger &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/byIt3SmVfyg?t=309"&gt;that’s only charging the iPhone at 18W&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="The Key stood vertically in front of an orange background, connected to a black cord." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MUJX1sTYIiG1ERH52jrjASssA8s=/0x1:1640x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69927097/eTjj9DPQqeSSYp21FI01_2864_copy_pdp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Drop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xe27tl"&gt;Sure, why not. Stack Overflow has teamed up with tech retailer Drop to release this cute little keyboard called The Key. It’s programmed to do exactly two things: copy and paste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tB5hno"&gt;The product started as an &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/"&gt;April Fools’ Day&lt;/a&gt; joke earlier this year — Stack Overflow users were shown alerts claiming that they had a limited number of copy / pastes and that they could only lift that cap by purchasing The Key. Users, as Stack Overflow’s &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/09/28/become-a-better-coder-with-this-one-weird-click/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; notes, were disappointed to find out that The Key was not a real thing they could buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUpIma"&gt;So, you can buy it now. It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-macropad%23overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22700522%2Fstack-overflow-macropad-mechanical-keyboard-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;up for preorder&lt;/a&gt; on Drop’s website for $29. Per the company, the next batch is shipping on December 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Key laid horizontally on a white surface, connected to a black cord." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ly1IBAU1kTqFIyCvAPHb5M6Kd78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887861/REMFbjgYSj2NKC4oK8s1_2676.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Drop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What more could you need?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6P7f3V"&gt;As you can see, we have three buttons here. We have C, and we have V. I’m not sure what the third button is supposed to do. That’s fine, of course, because the three keys are actually programmable — you can map them to do whatever task you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kxU5JK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“An ultra-smooth linear feel”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHlHuD"&gt;So there are some legitimate pragmatic use cases. First of all, if you make the third key a delete key, you can force every writer to edit their pieces with this device, and our articles will probably end up a lot more concise and better for it. More realistically, you can imagine mapping the keys to raise and lower brightness, for example (a setting that’s a pain to adjust on some computers), or to end a Zoom call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uL2UoT"&gt;Plus, imagine how cool you’d look using this in on a plane or something. Can you really put a price on a gadget-savvy aesthetic?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Key’s three keys lined up on a white surface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gb7PFu-35WVT8RHgETtGA86V_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887863/pqWbjKpQkulaQpK6SwoU_2688.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Drop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s Stack Overflow’s logo on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUEBGj"&gt;Now, macropads like this aren’t actually a new concept (though three is a somewhat small number of keys). You can get them &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fmarket%2Fmacropad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22700522%2Fstack-overflow-macropad-mechanical-keyboard-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all over Etsy&lt;/a&gt; — there’s one that’s literally just an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F625700003%2Fcherry-mx-mechanical-keyboard-switch%3Fga_order%3Dmost_relevant%26ga_search_type%3Dall%26ga_view_type%3Dgallery%26ga_search_query%3Dmacropad%26ref%3Dsr_gallery-1-37%26bes%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22700522%2Fstack-overflow-macropad-mechanical-keyboard-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Escape key&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QBaQ4"&gt;But in addition to its unique preprogramming, this one does appear particularly well-made. It’s outfitted with Kailh Box Black Switches, which Drop claims will deliver “an ultra-smooth linear feel.” The case is CNC-machined aluminum with custom XDA profile keycaps. I’m also seeing a USB-C connector on the back of the thing, and there are feet on the bottom to keep it from slipping. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Key laid horizontally on a white surface next to a black cord." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51N7b66xyHCJ_UlYe9tV3saAfvU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887865/DXfOBQRgCJagyMf7rONQ_2647.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Drop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cord is bigger than the keyboard, but sometimes that happens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fnJsOc"&gt;Oh, and you can also feel somewhat good about yourself while buying it. Stack Overflow is donating all of its proceeds to &lt;a href="https://www.digitalundivided.com/"&gt;digitalundivided&lt;/a&gt;, and Drop is donating five percent of its portion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPFFXk"&gt;So, what are you waiting for? Copy and paste away, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxsxvI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google search’s next phase: context is king</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xHowirLRwCuklvCPudSGDvMWE8w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69926828/acastro_180427_1777_0003.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google says search is still far from solved&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="R930gy"&gt;At its Search On event today, Google introduced several new features that, taken together, are its strongest attempts yet to get people to do more than type a few words into a search box. By leveraging its new Multitask Unified Model (MUM) machine learning technology in small ways, the company hopes to kick off a virtuous cycle: it will provide more detail and context-rich answers, and in return it hopes users will ask more detailed and context-rich questions. The end result, the company hopes, will be a richer and deeper search experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyLN12"&gt;Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan oversees search alongside Assistant, ads, and other products. He likes to say — and repeated in an interview this past Sunday — that “search is not a solved problem.” That may be true, but the problems he and his team are trying to solve now have less to do with wrangling the web and more to do with adding context to what they find there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzvXJE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI will help Google explore the questions people are asking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="75lUXB"&gt;For its part, Google is going to begin flexing its ability to recognize constellations of related topics using machine learning and present them to you in an organized way. A coming redesign to Google search will begin showing “Things to know” boxes that send you off to different subtopics. When there’s a section of a video that’s relevant to the general topic — even when the video as a whole is not — it will send you there. Shopping results will begin to show inventory available in nearby stores, and even clothing in different styles associated with your search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyV1eY"&gt;For your part, Google is offering — though perhaps “asking” is a better term — new ways to search that go beyond the text box. It’s making an aggressive push to get its image recognition software Google Lens into more places. It will be built into the Google app on iOS and also the Chrome web browser on desktops. And with MUM, Google is hoping to get users to do more than just identify flowers or landmarks, but instead use Lens directly to ask questions and shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orhHOq"&gt;“It’s a cycle that I think will keep escalating,” Raghavan says. “More technology leads to more user affordance, leads to better expressivity for the user, and will demand more of us, technically.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMVe7nxgCDRZMqzn0z4aOkpyvww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884248/google_lens_shirt_sock_search_wide_slow.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Lens will let users search using images and refine their query with text. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="312ACt"&gt;Those two sides of the search equation are meant to kick off the next stage of Google search, one where its machine learning algorithms become more prominent in the process by organizing and presenting information directly. In this, Google efforts will be helped hugely by recent advances in AI language processing. Thanks to systems known as large language models (MUM is one of these), machine learning has got much better at mapping the connections between words and topics. It’s these skills that the company is leveraging to make search not just more accurate, but more explorative and, it hopes, more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcnS2Q"&gt;One of Google’s examples is instructive. You may not have the first idea what the parts of your bicycle are called, but if something is broken you’ll need to figure that out. Google Lens can visually identify the derailleur (the gear-changing part hanging near the rear wheel) and rather than just give you the discrete piece of information, it will allow you to ask questions about fixing that thing directly, taking you to the information (in this case, the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTYPHGWDE6E"&gt;Berm Peak Youtube&lt;/a&gt; channel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qFXrbc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multimodal search requires entirely new input from users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLe91V"&gt;The push to get more users to open up Google Lens more often is fascinating on its own merits, but the bigger picture (so to speak) is about Google’s attempt to gather more context about your queries. More complicated, multimodal searches combining text and images demand “an entirely different level of contextualization that we the provider have to have, and so it helps us tremendously to have as much context as we can,” Raghavan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkHj6l"&gt;We are very far from the so-called “ten blue links” of search results that Google provides. It has been showing information boxes, image results, and direct answers for a long time now. Today’s announcements are another step, one where the information Google provides is not just a ranking of relevant information but a distillation of what its machines understand by scraping the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZderHj"&gt;In some cases — as with shopping — that distillation means you’ll likely be sending Google more page views. As with Lens, that trend is important to keep an eye on: Google searches increasingly push you to Google’s own products. But there’s a bigger danger here, too. The fact that Google is telling you more things directly increases a burden it’s always had: to speak with less bias. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCCmTM"&gt;By that, I mean bias in two different senses. The first is technical: the machine learning models that Google wants to use to improve search have well-documented problems with racial and gender biases. They’re trained by reading large swaths of the web, and, as a result, tend to pick up nasty ways of talking. Google’s troubles with its AI ethics team are also well documented at this point — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired"&gt;fired two lead researchers&lt;/a&gt; after they published a paper on this very subject. As Google’s VP of search, Pandu Nayak, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22460309"&gt;James Vincent in his article on today’s MUM announcements&lt;/a&gt;, Google knows that all language models have biases, but the company believes it can avoid “putting it out for people to consume directly.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vo4XOpVcCPykH4Q7FUe55J6_Hgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885162/Untitled__2_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new feature called “Things to know” will help users explore topics related to their searches. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhuquw"&gt;Be that as it may (and to be clear, it may not be), it sidesteps another consequential question and another type of bias. As Google begins telling you more of its own syntheses of information directly, what is the point of view from which it’s speaking? As journalists, we often talk about how the so-called “view from nowhere” is an inadequate way to present our reporting. What is Google’s point of view? This is an issue the company has confronted in the past, sometimes known as the “one true answer” problem. When Google tries to give people short, definitive answers using automated systems, it often ends up &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-one-true-answer-problem-featured-snippets-270549"&gt;spreading bad information&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3a0rVn"&gt;Presented with that question, Raghavan responds by pointing to the complexity of modern language models. “Almost all language models, if you look at them, are embeddings in a high dimension space. There are certain parts of these spaces that tend to be more authoritative, certain portions that are less authoritative. We can mechanically assess those things pretty easily,” he explains. Raghavan says the challenge is then how to present some of that complexity to the user without overwhelming them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bqROVQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Can Google remain neutral if it’s delivering answers to users directly?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvW70n"&gt;But I get the sense that the real answer is that, for now at least, Google is doing what it can to avoid facing the question of its search engine’s point of view by avoiding the domains where it could be accused of, as Raghavan puts it, “excessive editorializing.” Often when speaking to Google executives about these problems of bias and trust, they focus on easier-to-define parts of those high-dimension spaces like “authoritativeness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps3UWY"&gt;For example, Google’s new “Things to know” boxes won’t appear when somebody searches for things Google has identified as “particularly harmful/sensitive,” though a spokesperson says that Google is not “allowing or disallowing specific curated categories, but our systems are able to scalably understand topics for which these types of features should or should not trigger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocHpkr"&gt;Google search, its inputs, outputs, algorithms, and language models have all become almost unimaginably complex. When Google tells us that it is able to understand the contents of videos now, we take for granted that it has the computing chops to pull that off — but the reality is that even just indexing such a massive corpus is a monumental task that dwarfs the original mission of indexing the early web. (Google is only indexing audio transcripts of a subset of YouTube, for the record, though with MUM it aims to do visual indexing and other video platforms in the future). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHV15b"&gt;Often when you’re speaking to computer scientists, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem"&gt;traveling salesman problem&lt;/a&gt; will come up. It’s a famous conundrum where you attempt to calculate the shortest possible route between a given number of cities, but it’s also a rich metaphor for thinking through how computers do their machinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SWuVC"&gt;“If you gave me all the machines in the world, I could solve fairly big instances,” Raghavan says. But for search, he says that it is unsolved and perhaps unsolvable by just throwing more computers at it. Instead, Google needs to come up with new approaches, like MUM, that take better advantage of the resources Google can realistically create. “If you gave me all the machines there were, I’m still bounded by human curiosity and cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6UQaHl"&gt;Google’s new ways of understanding information are impressive, but the challenge is what it will do with the information and how it will present it. The funny thing about the traveling salesman problem is that nobody seems to stop and ask what exactly is in the case, what is he showing all his customers as he goes door to door?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps is making it easier to see wildfires and tree coverage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s Tree Canopy Lab" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvH5CmxgHi-PBZ_NxZA9Jo617yQ=/79x0:922x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69926815/Tree_Canopy_Insights.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google’s Tree Canopy Lab | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VwAh1r"&gt;Google Maps has new features that should make it easier for users to see wildfires, tree canopy, and locations without formal addresses. It’s all aimed at helping communities be “safer, more sustainable, and discoverable,” according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJRZkH"&gt;A new wildfire layer on Maps will begin rolling out globally this week, Google announced today. It’ll show most major fires, those prompting evacuations, across the world. Red splotches and pins on the layer will indicate where blazes are and how far they’ve spread. By tapping on any single wildfire, users can see more information, like how many acres have burned, what percentage of the fire has been contained, and links to local emergency resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09agYi"&gt;The map is updated about every hour. It uses data that’s gathered by satellites that are then processed by Google’s geospatial analysis platform, Earth Engine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQEPmX"&gt;It builds on a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376343/google-maps-search-wildfire-boundaries-california"&gt;Google piloted in California&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and expanded to the rest of the US in 2020. That pilot allowed people in the US to see the shifting boundaries of a nearby wildfire in near real-time but didn’t allow for users to view more than one fire at a time. That was limiting since multiple blazes can break out simultaneously within the same region during fire season, which is growing longer and more intense in the Western US as a result of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google rolled out a new wildfire layer on Maps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAGjPu9Aqc61IuxBXUN1QgulZBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885246/wildfire_layer_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google plans to roll out a new wildfire layer on Maps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ReVAIE"&gt;Not only will users in the US now have a bird’s-eye view of major fires nearby; they’ll also even be able to see small fires on the map — a feature not yet available in other parts of the world. Australia and some other locations could have that capability “in the coming months,” Google says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAGnJ2"&gt;There’s still one limitation, however, that Google has yet to hammer out with the wildfire layer. It can only be updated when the user is connected to the internet, which poses problems when wildfires &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Wildfire-threat-Bay-Area-cell-phone-internet-15495592.php"&gt;take out power lines and cell towers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZlghR"&gt;The other two updates Google announced are primarily designed to give local governments better planning and mapping tools. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573081/google-new-tool-hot-cities-trees-climate-change-temperature"&gt;launched a Tree Canopy Lab&lt;/a&gt; last year in Los Angeles to help the city identify spots in need of more trees. Getting more greenery to those neighborhoods is one way to prevent heat-related illnesses and death in places that are the most vulnerable during heatwaves. Temperatures can actually differ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;from neighborhood to neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; based on how much greenery they have, a trend that is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;made worse by a history of racial segregation&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZNWro"&gt;Google says Tree Canopy will be available in over 100 more cities in 2022, including Guadalajara, London, Sydney, and Toronto. It charts out the density of tree cover using images taken by plane for Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Address Maker app makes it easier for users to chart routes to locations without a formal address." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xp94RbXGKXvm48CyM4MoxomfvVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885339/Address_Maker__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Address Maker app makes it easier for users to chart routes to locations without a formal address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pSXyTR"&gt;Using Google Maps has always been more challenging for people who live in places without formal addresses. That’s made it more difficult for packages and emergency services like ambulances to reach many people living in rural areas and developing nations where addresses aren’t commonplace. So Google today launched a new app called Address Maker to make it easier for governments and NGOs to build out their own maps to fill in the blanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoJE2V"&gt;Address Maker is an expansion to Google’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272954/google-maps-plus-code-geolocation-digital-address-six-digit"&gt;Plus Codes&lt;/a&gt;, which allow people to share their location using a six-digit code in lieu of an address. (There are also Plus Codes for places with traditional addresses. The Plus Code for Google’s headquarters, for example, is ‘CWC8+R9 Mountain View, California.’)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkReJE"&gt;While a Plus Code for places without addresses will show up on Google Maps, a route to reach it might not. Address Maker aims to make it faster and easier for officials and local advocates to assign Plus Codes to locations and chart previously unmapped roads for an entire community. It uses an open-source algorithm, and Plus Codes are accessible offline.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google expands shopping searches with Lens and in-store inventory checks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWprwDNQAGM1IAQg-57T1fcZMp4=/141x0:1659x1012/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69926747/Search_On_Lens_Desktop_screenshot.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woIlY1"&gt;Shopping online isn’t always a convenience. If you enjoy window shopping or browsing curated collections at a brick-and-mortar store for inspiration, finding something online you don’t yet know you want or are unaware of is tricky if you start with a text search. Google is announcing new shopping search tools to try to alleviate this, with features that utilize Google Lens for finding products to buy from pictures online, broader search terms to help you browse clothing, and the ability to check in-store inventory from home. It claims the new tools will help shoppers “find what they’re looking for in a more visual way.” This comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21228741/google-shopping-free-listing-ads-search-coronavirus-covid"&gt;Google allowed all businesses to create listings on Google Shopping for free&lt;/a&gt; last year. Now, it wants more window shopping to be done right from Google search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXNJqK"&gt;Google Lens has been around since 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17715048/google-goggles-app-update-lens-ai"&gt;replacing Google Goggles&lt;/a&gt; that came before it, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17333154/google-lens-ai-ar-live-demo-hands-on-io-2018"&gt;the ability to use a smartphone camera to conduct visual searches&lt;/a&gt; based on the identification of objects found in the real world. Those image searches have allowed users to learn more about the things around them, even finding the same or similar item to buy without looking for a label or barcode to scan. Now, Google wants to make it possible to shop for any product you see in an image or video on the web with nothing more than the picture itself. Soon, iOS users will have a new dedicated button in the Google app, allowing a Google Lens search of any image on a page to bring up Google Shopping listings for purchase through a visual match. The feature will also be coming to Chrome on the desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJBNhK"&gt;Google did not give specific dates for this feature launching on iOS or desktop, stating that it hopes to roll them out by the end of the year. There was no initial mention of if or when this feature may come to Android, but Google has clarified that it plans to extend this functionality to Android at a later date, after the iOS and desktop versions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jV9ZIZu0xgGoDD9LE6cp4IyvlGg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885615/Search_On_Lens_Mode.gif"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6IMBomtnwiJfFffKLOs5F8VPJ70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885621/Search_On_Lens_Desktop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desktop Google Lens search on Chrome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x8M8Tu"&gt;Another shopping-focused feature coming from Google, which has surely been spurred on by the boom in e-commerce since the beginning of the pandemic, is easier browsing of clothing, accessories, and shoes via search results based on general terms. Google says that if you search for a generic article on mobile, for example, “cropped jackets,” you will see a visual feed of that type of clothing in a variety of colors and designs. These visual results will be accompanied by relevant videos, style guides, or local shops that carry those styles. From there, you can filter your search further according to brand, style, or department; check ratings and reviews; or compare prices on the results that appeal to you most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Gtmdk"&gt;Google calls this window shopping, which is one of the challenges of shopping for clothes online compared to going to a physical store to see what’s on display. It claims the dataset is pulled from over 24 billion product listings. The new feature is available only on mobile and is usable right from a Google search beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9pSNZFTXk45QIDYEBu3b3oCDkK8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885624/Shoppable_Search.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shoppable search within the Google app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MK3OxF"&gt;The third and final Google Shopping update allows users to remotely check in-store inventory directly within a Google search. Shoppers searching for a product are able to filter by “in stock.” This selection should show nearby stores that have the item available. Google claims the new feature can help a small business attract new customers, though it remains to be seen how accurate it might be across a variety of retailers and how one might ensure a product is there for them once they arrive — particularly at small businesses that do not have curbside or in-store pickup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDIDtP"&gt;Google has indicated that it does rely on data from the retailer to determine stock status and claims it will only indicate an item is in stock when there is high confidence; otherwise, it may show limited stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAnntE"&gt;The new “in stock” filter is available today across mobile web browsers and the Google app on both iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0k_JYSB5tKG7oj6AYQxQV4YdL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883129/SWIS_in_stock_filter.gif"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
