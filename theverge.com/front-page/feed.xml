    <title>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles looks like the perfect starting point for newcomers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TdxBK5Vo-tQnCJrnIKoJ7bEy9A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528650/TGAAC_Objection_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ysi52O"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series is one of gaming’s great pleasures, mashing up courtroom drama with anime sensibilities into something dramatic, heartwarming, and silly in equal measure. But if you’re a new player, it can be tough to know where to start. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306762/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-remastered-review-xbox-ps4-switch"&gt;the original trilogy starring Phoenix Wright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6105281/professor-layton-vs-phoenix-wright"&gt;a handful of spinoffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/10/12866404/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-spirit-of-justice-nintendo-3ds-review"&gt;more recent titles&lt;/a&gt; that further the story of a hapless defense attorney with a heart of gold. It’s like jumping into a long-running soap opera and having to quickly catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHHwy7"&gt;But it looks like a solution is almost here: Capcom is set to launch a prequel called &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; that offers the same tone and gameplay without all of the narrative baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7785xb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; is actually a compilation of two games that originally launched in Japan a few years back but have finally received a proper English localization. I had the chance to play through the first few chapters — there are 10 altogether — and the game plays out much like the rest of the series. That means most of your time is spent in a courtroom, where you’ll be meticulously going through statements and evidence in search of any contradictions you can find. In practice, this involves a lot of reading; &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; games play out mostly like a visual novel, with little breaks for investigating crime scenes or evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQqsq0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqAfvqsCaKg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9pPLE"&gt;The twist in &lt;em&gt;Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; is that it takes place at the dawn of the Meiji period, when Japan first began opening itself up to Western influence in things like art, science, and, yes, law. At the outset of the game, the whole idea of a judge, lawyers, and jury is still relatively new. This gives the game an interesting aesthetic, and it’s fun to listen to characters marvel at things like photographs or anesthesia. But more importantly, it offers a completely clean slate: you don’t have to know anything about Phoenix Wright, Miles Edgeworth, or any other &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; characters to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ILjmpl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How games like Final Fantasy XII and Phoenix Wright are translated into English","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523106/final-fantasy-12-phoenix-wright-translation-localization-alex-o-smith-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N81LPy"&gt;Despite the lack of familiar faces, the game retains the same charm — at least from what I’ve played. The very first case introduces the new protagonist, a law student named Ryunosuke Naruhodo, who has been accused of killing a visiting professor from Great Britain and is forced to defend himself. The trial is both intense and ridiculous. A key piece of evidence involves &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; a steak was eaten, and one of the key witnesses is a soldier who appears to be controlled by a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ1WO8"&gt;As always, slowly breaking these witnesses down by presenting contradictions is extremely satisfying, especially as each character will visibly change in elaborate ways to match their mental state. (The game retains the same 3D visual style as the previous &lt;em&gt;Spirit of Justice&lt;/em&gt;, which means these moments are particularly outlandish.) The game even gets serious at times; I was pleasantly surprised to see small moments that touched on the racism and sexism of the time. Much like Phoenix Wright before him, Naruhodo has a real lovable loser vibe that you can’t help but root for. The first time he yells “Objection!” is totally heart-warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnw1Lc"&gt;What’s great about the game, at least so far, is that it translates the things I love about the series — the sense of humor, the melodrama, the over-the-top characters, the thrill of connecting the dots — but in a completely new environment. As a longtime fan, it’s been refreshing. But for new players? It’s the ideal place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAHQry"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches July 27th on the PS4, Switch, and Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is rolling out longer videos to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idGCqzaFjxZM53xciJXF3I1KgwQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528476/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HCP7RC"&gt;TikToks are about to get longer. The app is now &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/longer-videos"&gt;rolling out the ability&lt;/a&gt; for everyone to publish videos up to three minutes in length, three times the existing one-minute limit. The extension is meant to give creators more flexibility while filming and limit the need for multi-part posts — though I suspect creators love hooking users that way and will keep breaking up stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXeLLy"&gt;Three-minute videos have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22003880/tiktok-longer-videos-three-minutes-short-quibi-youtube"&gt;been in testing&lt;/a&gt; at least since December, and it’s been easy to come across them when scrolling through videos from top TikTok creators, particularly in categories like cooking. Longer videos were limited to select users, though, but they’ll now be rolling out to everyone on TikTok “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7e3Bl"&gt;TikTok didn’t say how longer clips might affect its much-loved recommendation algorithm. But it’s worth considering the possible parallels to YouTube: as the platform grew, YouTube biased its algorithm toward viewer retention, which meant longer and longer videos — it’s why just about everything on YouTube is over 10 minutes long now. TikTok may not take the same approach, but if it turns out that longer videos = longer TikTok usage, we might see less of the app’s short, snappy, and strange viral clips.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratchet and Clank’s fidelity mode gets performance boost for 120Hz TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOEYI3pbno7mHxjJJ6RvOzLkRdM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528444/RACRA_Ratchet.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ukvBmR"&gt;The latest patch for &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; has given the game a small but significant performance boost when playing using its fidelity mode on 120Hz displays. According to the &lt;a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/4403977358861-Version-1-002-Release-Notes"&gt;patch notes for version 1.002&lt;/a&gt; of the game, fidelity mode now runs at 40 frames per second when used with 120Hz displays, up from the 30 frames per second previously. That’s over a 30 percent improvement, which should make the game look a lot smoother and feel a lot more responsive to play in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvIqcN"&gt;It’s a change that mainly affects just one of the three display modes the PS5 game shipped with, but it’s a fascinating example of the kinds of things that will become possible as 120Hz TVs become the norm. It’s also an interesting workaround for Sony’s current lack of support for variable refresh rates (VRR) on its console, a feature which the company has said it plans to add in a &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/#:~:text=does%20ps5%20support%20vrr%3Fps5%20hardware%20supports%20variable%20refresh%20rate%20(vrr)%20through%20hdmi%202.1.%20after%20a%20future%20system%20software%20update%2C%20ps5%20owners%20will%20be%20able%20to%20use%20the%20vrr%20feature%20of%20compatible%20tvs%20when%20playing%20games%20that%20support%20vrr."&gt;future software update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l75A2u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It works in the high-resolution Fidelity mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dvkNoK"&gt;For the uninitiated, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; originally shipped with three display modes: Fidelity, Performance, and Performance RT. Performance runs the game without ray tracing at 60 frames per second, at a resolution of between 1620p and 1800p, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-performance-analysis"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Performance RT adds ray tracing support and still runs at 60fps, but resolution is lower at between 1080p and 1440p. Finally, there’s fidelity mode, where you get ray tracing and the highest resolutions of between 1800p and 2160p (full 4K), but at the cost of frame rate, which was previously limited to 30fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1SqS5"&gt;But now, if you’ve got a compatible 120Hz TV, that frame rate sits at 40fps rather than 30. You might be confused about why this requires a 120Hz TV in the first place, and why it won’t work on regular 60Hz TVs. After all, 60 is more than 40, which suggests that it should be possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNfkip"&gt;The reason is that in order for motion to display smoothly, a game’s frames should ideally divide equally across a display’s refresh rate. It’s easy for a 60Hz display to display a 30fps game, for example, because it will show a new frame once every couple of refreshes. But other frame rates that don’t equally divide into 60 are more complicated. It’s why TV manufacturers have to put in a lot of effort to make sure that movies (which are typically shown at 24 frames per second) &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/motion/24p"&gt;can play smoothly and without judder on otherwise 60Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bsyr6e"&gt;That’s why a 120Hz TV makes smooth 40fps content possible, because each frame can be divided across three refreshes. And &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ratchet-patch-targets-40fps-in-fidelity-mode-when-using-120hz-displays.450094/page-9"&gt;users on ResetEra&lt;/a&gt; report that playing the game in this mode feels a lot smoother than the previous 30fps mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYe5IS"&gt;It’s worth noting that &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; did originally ship with 120Hz support. But this didn’t affect the game’s frame rate, and instead was designed to reduce input latency. The mode was &lt;a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/4403131131917-Version-1-001-003-Release-Notes"&gt;later removed&lt;/a&gt; over the compatibility issues it caused. With its return, however, input latency should also see improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQ37jR"&gt;Of course, the ideal future is for everything to support variable refresh rates, which allow screens to dynamically scale to whatever frame rate a game is able to produce, rather than being limited to arbitrary frame rate caps. The feature is already supported on Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S consoles, most modern PC graphics cards, and a growing number of HDMI 2.1-equipped TVs. But there’s still no sign of the update for PS5 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator is getting huge PC performance improvements this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fslumsbxA9hN2ZPXFzubD3m0pqY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528401/MFS_613_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3yAY84"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357949/intel-core-i9-11900k-review"&gt;notoriously demanding PC game&lt;/a&gt;, but a big patch is arriving later this month that promises significant performance improvements. Asobo, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, has been busy rewriting its engine to perform well on Xbox Series X / S, and the changes will also bring some much-needed improvements to the PC side on July 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ7WIv"&gt;During a recent &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1072488104"&gt;Twitch stream&lt;/a&gt;, spotted by &lt;a href="https://twinfinite.net/2021/06/microsoft-flight-simulator-pc-xbox-details/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twinfinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Asobo demonstrated just how significant the performance improvements will be on older systems with an Intel Core i7-9700K and an RTX 2060 Super. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; jumped from around 30fps to nearly a solid 60fps just thanks to the patch. CPU utilization also drops from 100 percent to 75 percent on this particular PC, and memory drops from around 16GB to 4.7GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3i4iSx"&gt;“We have rewritten a lot of the parts of the engine ... in order to get the maximum performance out of the sim,” explains Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch. The team has been mainly working on CPU optimizations, as the game has been incredibly CPU heavy since its launch last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x7jzL5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZ6XpfaWbko?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6b6DPs"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; will move to DirectX 12 for Xbox Series X / S, the game will remain on DirectX 11 on PC for now. “All the performance improvements come from just improving the simulator,” confirms Wloch. “PC has not yet moved to DirectX 12, the team is still working on it. It may bring improvements further, or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRLVSE"&gt;Martial Bossard, an executive producer on &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;at Asobo, confirmed the upcoming move to DirectX 12 on PC will also allow the team to enable ray tracing in the game. Effects should include better water, improved shadows, and the usual reflections we expect to see in ray-traced games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvCVwY"&gt;With the Xbox version of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; launching on July 27th, alongside these PC changes, the team confirmed that the simulator will run at 30fps on both the Xbox Series X and Series S. As both consoles support variable refresh rates (VRR), there will be an option to go higher than 30fps on TVs and monitors that support it. The Xbox Series X will run &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; at 4K, while the Xbox Series S runs the game at 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic images reveal traditional design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYgBa1ligMaHWD8lHHdMQ_Oz-wY=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528107/Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_4_Classic_AH_02_1420x799.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic in black, gray, and white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic" target="_blank"&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UUUU0Y"&gt;Images of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 Classic have leaked online, giving us our first look at what could be the more traditionally-styled entry in Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch lineup. The images, &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show a smartwatch with a rotating bezel and two buttons on its right-hand side, available in white, gray, and black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZsbwC"&gt;The watch will reportedly be available in three sizes in total: 42mm, 44mm, and 46mm, and will run on the smartwatch platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;co-developed by Samsung and Google&lt;/a&gt;. The watch will also reportedly be available in either stainless steel or aluminum, will be water resistant up to a depth of 50 meters (thanks to a 5ATM rating), and should be rugged thanks to a MIL-STD-810G certification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YzYnhxuTisc4WxfgQlfVKc90-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693150/Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_4_Classic_AH_06_1420x778.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic" target="_blank"&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch is shown with a rotating bezel and two side buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H3rwlt"&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic appears to be one of at least two smartwatch models Samsung plans to announce this summer. There could also be a &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-design-specifications-renders-exclusive/"&gt;non-Classic Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; on the way, which ditches the rotating bezel for a slimmer design that looks closer to Samsung’s previous Active-branded smartwatches (in fact, some leaks have referred to this watch as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;Galaxy Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;). The non-Classic version will reportedly be available in 40mm and 44mm sizes, and will also feature 5ATM water resistance and MIL-STD 810G durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYb9Ng"&gt;Regardless of how these watches end up being branded, it looks like Samsung has a busy summer ahead of it for smartwatch announcements. &lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt; speculates that we might see these new watches announced at an Unpacked event in early August, which will presumably also include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;new Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 5G foldables&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; recently leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge blocks Florida’s social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2eww3"&gt;A Florida internet law is on hold while a lawsuit contesting it continues. Judge Robert Hinkle has &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.371253/gov.uscourts.flnd.371253.113.0_1.pdf"&gt;issued a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; blocking nearly all of SB 7072, a controversial and sweeping regulation of social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogBgFP"&gt;“The legislation now at issue was an effort to rein in social-media providers deemed too large and too liberal. Balancing the exchange of ideas among private speakers is not a legitimate governmental interest,” Hinkle wrote his order. Moreover, the law “discriminates on its face among otherwise identical speakers,” partly thanks to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;eyebrow-raising exemption&lt;/a&gt; for companies that operate a theme park. That raises the bar for evaluating whether the law violates the First Amendment — and in Hinkle’s estimation, it probably does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5m4u9Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The legislation compels providers to host speech that violates their standards ... and forbids providers from speaking as they otherwise would”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cARv0g"&gt;SB 7072, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451425/florida-social-media-moderation-facebook-twitter-deplatforming"&gt;signed by Governor Ron DeSantis&lt;/a&gt; in May, limits when web services can kick off users. It includes a ban on suspending or annotating the posts of political candidates, a requirement that users can “opt out” of algorithmic sorting systems, and an “antitrust violator blacklist” for companies that break the rules. As mentioned above, the rules don’t apply to “a company that owns and operates a theme park or entertainment complex,” placating media conglomerates like Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MTHy0"&gt;Industry groups NetChoice and the CCIA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457200/ccia-netchoice-lawsuit-florida-social-media-law-unconstitutional"&gt;sued to stop the law’s enforcement&lt;/a&gt;, saying it would compel social media platforms to host offensive speech that violated their editorial policies. Judge Hinkle &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-nsf-social-media-law-challenge-20210629-qt7aescdpjgvjolssxumrbuuey-story.html"&gt;heard arguments&lt;/a&gt; from both groups and the DeSantis administration on Monday, when he appeared dubious of the law, calling the theme park exemption in particular a “major constitutional issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XjEHY"&gt;The injunction is similarly skeptical, summarizing the law as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MOps1T"&gt;“The state of Florida has adopted legislation that imposes sweeping requirements on some but not all social-media providers. The legislation applies only to large providers, not otherwise-identical but smaller providers, and explicitly exempts providers under common ownership with any large Florida theme park. The legislation compels providers to host speech that violates their standards — speech they otherwise would not host — and forbids providers from speaking as they otherwise would. The Governor’s signing statement and numerous remarks of legislators show rather clearly that the legislation is viewpoint-based. And parts contravene a federal statute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="laao68"&gt;The federal statute Hinkle mentions is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a rule that gives websites and apps wide latitude to decide what material they host. Beyond that, Hinkle says social networks regularly use editorial judgment to prioritize, remove, label, and otherwise sort content shown to users — and much of that editorial judgment is likely protected by the First Amendment. “The state has asserted it is on the side of the First Amendment; the plaintiffs are not. It is perhaps a nice sound bite. But the assertion is wholly at odds with accepted constitutional principles,” Hinkle writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dtz0gT"&gt;Federal lawmakers, like state ones, have an appetite for regulating social media. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a package of bills&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing the potential monopoly power of companies like Facebook and Google, as well as several proposals for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;changing Section 230&lt;/a&gt;. In April, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368045/clarence-thomas-social-media-regulation-knight-v-trump"&gt;made a case&lt;/a&gt; for regulating social media. But Florida’s law was one of the first, most sweeping rules governing how companies can moderate web platforms — and it’s not surprising that it’s been stopped short.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is building support for digital COVID vaccine cards into Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2NdixgkE_2rijXpFkTiMdbzV9ag=/0x27:1600x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69527264/_GD_BLOG__Covid_cards_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A digital COVID vaccine card in Android.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a1e3j5"&gt;Google is opening up Android’s built-in passes system to &lt;a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/google-updates-passes-api-to-save-covid-testing-and-vaccination-information-on-Android-devices.html"&gt;let Android users store a digital vaccine card&lt;/a&gt;, which it calls a COVID Card, on their phone. The feature will initially roll out in the US, and it will rely on support from healthcare providers, local governments, or other organizations authorized to distribute COVID vaccines. The feature will also support storing COVID test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKcq4t"&gt;For vaccinations, your COVID Card will show info on when you were vaccinated and which vaccine you received, according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261"&gt;a Google support page&lt;/a&gt;. The card can be saved from your healthcare provider’s app or website as well as from texts or emails sent to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnhL79"&gt;Google recommends that you add a shortcut to the card on your home screen and will offer the option when you save your card to your device. Google says that the card won’t be saved the cloud and that it won’t use the information you provide for advertising purposes, but &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/10890261#zippy=%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-save-my-covid-card%2Chow-your-information-is-used%2Cwhat-information-is-provided-to-google-when-i-use-my-covid-card"&gt;it does say&lt;/a&gt; that it will collect some information, like how many times you use your card and on which days. And you won’t have to have the Google Pay app downloaded to save and access cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJfDvs"&gt;It’s good to see that Google is making it easier for people to save their vaccination status digitally on their phones, though whether you’re actually able to use the feature or not will still depend on your healthcare provider or government. Some states, like &lt;a href="https://epass.ny.gov/home"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/vaccinationrecords/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, have implemented their own digital vaccine cards, but Google’s version could streamline the process for other authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter now lets you set a security key as your only two-factor authentication method </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/liOLy5ZIj6rZdv0OQ_ESxxrvWzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526952/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CtzN6Z"&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332234/twitter-security-key-2fa-authenticator-privacy"&gt;Twitter said it would soon&lt;/a&gt; let you use a security key as your only two-factor authentication method, and on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1410343864431374340"&gt;it announced that feature was live&lt;/a&gt; on both mobile and web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMwetL"&gt;Being able to use a security key as one of your two-factor authentication methods isn’t new, but now you can make it the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one, if you want to. Physical security keys have advantages over other two-factor methods like an authenticator app or SMS because they don’t rely on a code that a bad actor could intercept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4TrpRn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now security keys can be your one and only two-factor authentication method on mobile and web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about how security keys can protect your account from attacks: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ta7uQSFhi6"&gt;https://t.co/Ta7uQSFhi6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/aPDOnbRtVk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aPDOnbRtVk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1410343864431374340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DY7WQ"&gt;In recent years, Twitter has added a number of features to beef up login security. The company expanded beyond SMS in 2017 by adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16802936/twitter-login-verification-two-factor-authentication-security-update"&gt;support for authentication apps&lt;/a&gt; like Google Authenticator and Authy. In 2019, Twitter let you enable two-factor authentication &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977436/twitter-2fa-phone-number-authentication-app-security-key"&gt;without giving your phone number&lt;/a&gt;, a positive change given that SMS can be vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks (like the one that led to CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;losing control of his account&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841288/jack-dorsey-ceo-twitter-account-hacked-chuckle-gang-shane-dawson-james-charles"&gt;about an hour and a half&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXBcXp"&gt;If you’re interested in picking up a security key for yourself, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f"&gt;check out our guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first five minutes of Netflix’s Fear Street trilogy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBDoIPC8DioAIruvoYUBJjFD9E4=/210x0:1782x1048/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526851/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.13.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCFb8t"&gt;Netflix has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8BjVmKJnPY"&gt;the first five minutes&lt;/a&gt; of its upcoming horror movie trilogy &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt;, inspired by R.L. Stine’s &lt;em&gt;Fear Street &lt;/em&gt;series of young adult novels. The film trilogy, which will be released over three Fridays starting on July 2nd, is also split across three separate time periods: 1994, 1978, and 1666. Teens fleeing for their lives is universal, regardless of the year, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTvc31"&gt;Here’s Netflix’s synopsis for the films:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QfN0Ru"&gt;In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events that have haunted their town for generations ​may all be connected — and that they may be the next targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JXiW4L"&gt;As someone who grew up on &lt;em&gt;Goosebumps &lt;/em&gt;and marathoned the made-for-TV movie adaptations of the books every Halloween, &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; seems like a pretty great update on that vibe. These first five minutes aren’t super scary, but they do translate some classic slasher movie tropes into R.L. Stine’s goofy style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cip8wY"&gt;If you want a more expansive look at the whole series, rather than just the first entry —  &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part One: 1994 — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444575/netflix-fear-street-trilogy-rl-stine-release-date"&gt;you can check out this trailer from May&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GFVJjj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMOBcDMS6c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MCKE45"&gt;There’s not long to wait before you can get your R.L. Stine summer going: &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part One: 1994&lt;/em&gt; premieres July 2nd, followed by &lt;em&gt;Feat Street Part Two: 1978 &lt;/em&gt;on July 9th, and &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part Three: 1666&lt;/em&gt; on July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Music Widget brings back the original Mac OS X iTunes widget </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBUOzLPYFsArf_EmTmaoJFxcNSY=/180x0:2226x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526721/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_5.35.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVvWck"&gt;Way back in 2005, Apple released Mac OS X Tiger, and with it, the original implementation of widgets on the Mac through its Dashboard software. One of those widgets was a now-defunct iTunes media player — but thanks to the efforts of programmer Mario Guzman, who’s recreated an &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;exact replica of the widget&lt;/a&gt; for modern Macs, you can once again enjoy your music in retro OS X style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWlpeF"&gt;Ironically, the new Music Widget isn’t actually a widget (at least, not in the current style of widgets introduced in last year’s macOS Big Sur,) but rather a standalone app that mimics the look of the original iTunes widget from 2005. The app is fully functional, offering the same controls as the original. Music Widget only works with the Apple Music app, though— Spotify (or other music apps) won’t work with the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UzDpD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alright nerds. I have an early beta version of my Music Widget up for download. Let me know what you think. Retweets/screenshots are welcome.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/51sfimm7LI"&gt;https://t.co/51sfimm7LI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mario Guzman  ️‍      (@MarioGuzman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarioGuzman/status/1408876166165893122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCWRTu"&gt;Guzman’s replica also draws most of the artwork and UI elements directly in code, instead of using images, so you’re not stuck with 2005-era visuals on the widget when running on a pixel-dense Retina display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="R2X14x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Listen to Spotify on this nostalgic iPod-style web music player","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="L6rCTI"&gt;It’s not the only retro-style music player to pop up recently, either: &lt;a href="https://tannerv.com/ipod/"&gt;software developer Tanner Villarete&lt;/a&gt; created a stylistically similar web app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;offers an iPod Classic interface&lt;/a&gt; for listening to your Spotify or Apple Music library earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZ2uj"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;Music Widget is still in beta&lt;/a&gt;, and can be downloaded for free from Guzman’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
