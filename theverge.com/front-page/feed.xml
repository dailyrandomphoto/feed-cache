    <title>Apple retakes second place in smartphone shipment rankings as sanctions bite Huawei</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pesyUj"&gt;Apple overtook Huawei to reclaim its spot as the second-bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world in 2020, according to new research reports from &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung was still the leading seller in terms of number of smartphones shipped, while Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo took the next three spots, according to Counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwdPw2"&gt;It was just under a year ago that the same research analysts reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;Huawei had overtaken Apple&lt;/a&gt; to take second place in 2019. But since then, US trade sanctions seem to have hit Huawei hard. The Chinese company’s smartphone shipments were 21 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Counterpoint, and Huawei dropped out of the top five entirely in the fourth quarter of the year. It’s the first time in six years Huawei hasn’t been in the top five, Canalys notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-shipment-Q4-2020" target="_blank"&gt;Canalys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s smartphone shipments dropped out of the top five in Q4 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QAHESd"&gt;Although Huawei was still able to hold on to the number three spot overall, thanks to domestic sales in China (where it reportedly shipped 70 percent of its phones in 2019), Xiaomi seized the opportunity to expand internationally and saw shipments increase by 17 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. However, the fastest-growing smartphone brand in 2020 was reportedly Realme, which shipped 65 percent more phones than it did in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhyalT"&gt;Apple’s gains were more modest, increasing by 3 or 5 percent year over year depending on whether you ask Counterpoint Research or Canalys. The latter notes that Apple shipped the most iPhones ever in the fourth quarter of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q13uhFOoULy8NsTeIXRBNF4PxbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265691/msedge_cg52VaBVpy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-shipped-record-iphones-q4-2020-global-smartphone-market-continues-recover/" target="_blank"&gt;Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterpoint Research reports that Apple overtook Huawei last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HxLL2G"&gt;Although it’s still the bestselling smartphone manufacturer in the world, both reports suggest that Samsung’s smartphone business is losing market share. Both Canalys and Counterpoint say its shipments fell 14 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. It’s still around 50 million smartphones ahead of second place Apple, but the gap appears to be narrowing. Counterpoint says that the South Korean electronics giant is facing stiff competition from Apple at the high end of the market and from Chinese manufacturers in the midrange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9173w"&gt;Overall, the entire smartphone market was reportedly down compared to 2019. Canalys reports that shipments were down 7 percent, while Counterpoint reports a bigger 10 percent decline. Counterpoint blames the pandemic and resulting lockdowns for the drop, but notes that shipments began to pick up in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After buy ban, GameStop hypebeasts are looking for a Robinhood alternative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tB_SWRTdr9yrUDqwCWGKo4Dh5WE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734726/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Smd00e"&gt;In the wake of Robinhood’s surprise trading block, a new class of Reddit investors are looking for apps that will let them plow their money into their favorite stocks. On Thursday morning, Robinhood announced that it would temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;block investors&lt;/a&gt; from purchasing or trading companies including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond, and Nokia, all of which have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;unexpected rallies over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;. But for the online communities that fueled those rallies, the block is being treated as an outright betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCypZ"&gt;Discussion about switching ramped up on Twitter and in investment discords after Robinhood halted buying and trading on stock, citing “recent volatility” in the market with the aforementioned stock as the reason it prevented additional trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HG1HjA"&gt;Since the decision, Robinhood’s app on the App Store has received thousands of one-star reviews as a form of practice known as review bombing. On the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, angry Robinhood users are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x130/class_action_against_robinhood_allowing_people_to/"&gt;calling for a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; because “allowing people to only sell is the definition of market manipulation,” according to one post. There’s even a new subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/"&gt;specifically for suing the company&lt;/a&gt;. Another Robinhood &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewNiss/status/1354821478613540864"&gt;user tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that after years of being on the platform, the move felt like a “slap to the face,” adding “to be regulated in a time of absolute prime opportunities is an embarrassment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDJVPq"&gt;On Twitter, beloved rapper and Fyre Fest promoter Ja Rule did not mince words: “Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmLLDl"&gt;Robinhood has been central to much of the chaos within the financial sector over the last few days. Investors from r/WallStreetBets or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;its private Discord server&lt;/a&gt; used the personal finance app to inflate GameStop and other stocks as a blow against Wall Street hedge funds. But now that Robinhood has taken steps to stem the rally, the r/WallStreetBets community feels betrayed — and is already looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FoWbo1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwG0Kz"&gt;The list of brokerages that have stopped allowing trades and buys of the aforementioned stock continue to grow: Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, and Interactive Brokers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354828729713881091"&gt;and WeBull&lt;/a&gt; have all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354828730674372610"&gt;halted trading&lt;/a&gt;. But Public, an app similar to Robinhood, has continued to allow buys and trades without restriction, although the app “has added Safety Labels to help inform and provide context to our users before they make a trade,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hgz8G1"&gt;For Robinhood competitors like Public, it’s a golden opportunity. In fact, Public is doubling the free stock slice &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/public/status/1354810368191733770"&gt;for member referrals today&lt;/a&gt;. Popular YouTube personality Casey Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354794425528934405"&gt;tweeted on Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt; just after the Robinhood halting began that “everyone complaining about @RobinhoodApp delisting GameStop and I’m over here on @public about to get Bill Gates rich.” He later said that no one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795210765606913"&gt;should take investment advice from him&lt;/a&gt; and that he’s an investor in Public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;“Also im an investor in public and i hope this ridiculous behavior from Robinhood brings attention to superior companies (like Public),” Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795211713470467"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xstnn2"&gt;Switching to a competitor will still add some friction — and might cost investors valuable time in an exceptionally volatile situation. When creating an account on Public, for instance people may have to wait a few days for their application to be approved, according to a message that appears during the signup process. If people are trying to get in on GameStop and AMC while the magic rally is still in effect, that delay might defeat the purpose — although at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter had their account approved in the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YZqB5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u78AiF"&gt;Most apps also allow investors to &lt;a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/2673094-can-i-transfer-another-investment-account-to-public"&gt;transfer their portfolios&lt;/a&gt; from other brokerages, including Robinhood, which could be faster. But there’s still likely to be a significant delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsfbgR"&gt;Webull is another investment app, and the FAQ states that “in most cases, account application is approved automatically.” Webull’s website also states that people can trade in the same day if “you deposit via ACH before 4:00 pm on a trading day” — basically, if funds are transferred from something like a bank to Webull. The site also states, however, that people “will get a provisional credit (up to $1000 depending on the incoming deposit) of buying power after your deposit,” which gives people “provisional buying power to trade.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XbLN8"&gt;Transferring stocks from one app to another, or flocking to another app to buy stocks, seems tedious — but as long as it’s unclear when Robinhood and other brokerages will allow purchases, GameStop’s new stockholders are left with no other choice. At the time of publication, GameStop’s stock was sitting at $155 — down from yesterday’s high of $468, but still more than triple where the stock was last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AVdH3"&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich,” popular YouTube creator Ricky “FaZe Banks” Bengston &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Banks/status/1354786829388500998"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “You guys fkn blew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjCjvW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDul1v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Parler down, QAnon moves onto a ‘free speech’ TikTok clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJaQaBGiiPD0KJU3xLkNLW7vHk0=/69x0:444x250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734686/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clapper&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7b6NKq"&gt;After this month’s deadly attack at the Capitol, QAnon has been widely banished from the internet. Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have all banned Q-related content, and the right’s favored platform, Parler, has been forced offline for weeks. But it hasn’t all disappeared. A new platform called Clapper, a “free-speech” TikTok clone, is becoming a home for QAnon followers.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD5LiA"&gt;Clapper launched last July as a “Free Speech Short Video” app — it’s basically TikTok, but the company promises a lot less moderation. In the six months since its launch, the app has been downloaded over half a million times, with a considerable amount of that growth coming in just the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yjqtb"&gt;Once you download Clapper, you can start scrolling through a “For You” page that works similarly to TikTok’s. But instead of seeing popular creators like Charli D’Amelio, the feed looks like if &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/youtube-suspends-oann-violating-its-covid-19-policy-n1248845"&gt;One America News Network&lt;/a&gt; made a short-form video app. There are airsoft and fishing videos with people calling themselves “patriots,” but also plenty of anti-vax misinformation and videos calling out Democrats as “pedophiles.” According to Clapper’s website, #trump2020 and other political hashtags are some of the most popular on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dmDR2Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While the app might have been meant as a semi decent TikTok clone, it’s now taken the place of Parler”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="twvXL8"&gt;“Don’t be fooled,” one review read on the Google Play Store. “While the app might have been meant as a semi decent TikTok clone, it’s now taken the place of Parler in terms of [QAnon] and Bigots taking it over as their own little echochamber. If you enjoy bigotry and conspiracy theorists, by all means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSCNFp"&gt;Some QAnon influencers have built sizable followings on the app, playing off hashtags like #WWG1WGA and #thestorm that would be blocked on Instagram or Twitter. One user, named Josh Sardam, has made videos supporting Q-Anon adjacent Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and made comments about individuals being a part of the “NWO,” or new world order. In another private messaging group titled “2021 The Great Awakening,” Sardam shares memes and theories with the closest fans, some of whom give Patreon-style donations to support the work. All told, Sardam reaches nearly 30,000 followers on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKiZxQ"&gt;For every user turned off by the presence of Q content, there are others who are drawn in. Like Parler and Gab before it, Clapper has become a popular home for conservatives who disagree with the moderation decisions of large tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and especially TikTok. Scrolling through Clapper-related hashtags on TikTok, like #joinclapper, there are dozens of videos of users announcing their transition to the TikTok free-speech clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nL82QW"&gt;“Clapper’s almost exactly like TikTok, but it’s got better content and they don’t censor people like a bunch of communists,” one TikTok user, with the username @your_favoritebiker, posted last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LC6jWH"&gt;Clapper CEO and co-founder Edison Chen realizes a lot of the app’s recent growth has come from QAnon believers and right-wing political accounts, but he isn’t losing sleep over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGI2go"&gt;“There are lots of conservatives and political people,” Chen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think they feel less censorship here and they’re kicked out from the other social media platforms. So they come to us, and it brings some opportunity to us but [it] also comes with some challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09803i"&gt;Clapper is based in Dallas, Texas, Chen said, and has fifteen employees. Users upload “thousands” of videos a day, Chen said, and Clapper has only two US employees and ten outside of the country who field content reports. In a follow-up email, Chen said that Clapper targets millennial and boomer users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5uvZp"&gt;When asked if Clapper allows QAnon content on its platform, Chen first told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that moderation largely relies on reports from its users, but content that could incite violence is prohibited. Later, Chen said that Clapper had “identified” several QAnon-related users and was conducting an investigation into whether they violated the app’s community standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70ktyp"&gt;“Some of the users on our app are talking a lot about QAnon, and we are still working on it to further investigate if they truly are against our community guidelines,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCF68V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Read our official announcement and response to the events at the U.S. Capitol. &lt;a href="https://t.co/KnOT4Y8vDA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KnOT4Y8vDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Clapper (@NewsClapper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NewsClapper/status/1348308885304733697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8fqROi"&gt;Earlier this month, Clapper content helped the FBI identify an Ohio man who attended the Capitol riot. Justin Stoll was arrested by the FBI and charged with making online threats and witness tampering on January 15th, &lt;a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/wilmington-ohio-man-arrested-fbi-participation-us-capitol-riot-1-15-2021"&gt;according to ABC 6 News in Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. In videos posted to Clapper, Stoll made threatening comments before the riot, saying “Basically, if you are an enemy combatant, you will be shot on sight I know this is the end-all flag.” Stoll also posted videos outside of the Capitol alongside other rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yx1Vrn"&gt;Clapper responded to the deadly attack at the Capitol &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NewsClapper/status/1348308885304733697?s=20"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; on January 10th saying, “As many Americans, we watched in horror as a violent mob breached the US Capitol in the name of ‘political protest.’ In the aftermath of these events, we want to re-emphasize that the Clapper platform has a zero tolerance on violence of any kind, as well as individuals who incite violence for personal or political gains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uv1ts"&gt;Chen said that Clapper did not set out to be a right-wing conservative political platform, and that the company wants to highlight ordinary users’ lives. “Today’s social media platforms push most traffic to big creators while the creator in the middle and the normal user don’t get the opportunity to speak and be seen,” Chen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1QO3i"&gt;Following &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Wednesday interview with Chen, he sent a follow-up email including examples of the less political side of Clapper, highlighting accounts from a &lt;a href="https://newsclapper.com/FatPanda208?r=E7JZQG0PKQ"&gt;truck driver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://newsclapper.com/thegaryjonesjr?r=E7JZQG0PKQ"&gt;country music singer&lt;/a&gt;, and a “&lt;a href="https://newsclapper.com/AttaGirl_Axes?r=E7JZQG0PKQ"&gt;girl with axes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5pSwI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open Roads is a game about riffling through the past while your mom watches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHM3fndX65Ep2EpKjldDSpRyBPs=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734545/ss_a408fa5bef976c37712481bf5f628f526802df2a.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u1gqgv"&gt;In Steve Gaynor’s attic, there is a box that does not belong to him. He bought his Portland home from a family who put the house up for sale after the death of its elderly owner. Months later, Gaynor and his wife discovered a cardboard box full of letters and other artifacts from a stranger’s life. “There was this backstory about this person who had been part of this family that was all contained inside this one cardboard box,” Gaynor said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcJsyK"&gt;It’s an anecdote almost too good to be believed: a co-founder of Fullbright, a studio known for pioneering “walking sim” games, living out his very own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/15/4621514/gone-home-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style adventure. Gaynor wondered not just about the box’s owner, but the possibilities of these found items: “How can we express that feeling of discovering those things together?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TxEab"&gt;The answer might just be Fullbright’s new project, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167445/fullbright-open-roads-the-game-awards-keri-russell"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a mother-daughter road trip starring Keri Russell as mom Opal and Kaitlyn Dever as teen Tess. Announced late last year, &lt;em&gt;Open Roads &lt;/em&gt;is a first-person exploration game where players dig through abandoned places for clues about a family member’s past. “It’s a game that in a lot of ways continues our tradition of what we have been doing at Fullbright,” says Gaynor. It’s a story-driven experience, where the mystery is personal and built around relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCU1dXXCAqdWeLLG-hfT7e9tw2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22265600/ss_a3aa4fb682b940da1896c5e14a91dc3cf82cd2cd.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6YhPQq"&gt;But where past games allowed the player to be a true voyeur, left to riffle through personal objects and history at their leisure, &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt; has perhaps the most diligent of all possible companions: your mom. “You can get away with a lot when it’s just you being in the space,” says Gaynor. “There’s this sort of permission to be transgressive in a certain way in our other games, where we kind of say it’s okay to dig deep into other people’s personal stuff. I think in some cases in &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;, it just becomes part of the conversation.” Opal will have her own opinions about what you find, as well as history to share through her eyes. How and why she interjects, and what that says about her perspective, as well as her relationship to Tess, is part of the game’s fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vkpof"&gt;And then there’s Tess, the player character. &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt; is Fullbright’s first venture into playing with branching dialogue, a choice that Gaynor says serves to express who Tess is, rather than impact the game’s outcome. “You’re kind of on a path along this journey with Opal, but within that you have a lot of control as Tess with how you want to relate to your mom,” he says. How confrontational or supportive a player wants to be, for example, is their prerogative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRjIvM"&gt;In the past decade or so, game narratives have grown to love the so-called sad dad — watching figures like Joel from &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; become a surrogate father to Ellie, or &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s Kratos on a journey with his son. But mothers in games have yet to be represented with such complexity or even commonality. Those relationships can be fickle and emotionally convoluted. In other words, they’re ripe for engaging stories. “What’s more interesting to us to put on screen? What is a story that’s not getting told as much?” says Gaynor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="53bV5N"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGngJgAXM6Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrr7O"&gt;Influenced by stories like &lt;em&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/em&gt; and girlhood experiences from members of the team, including Gaynor’s co-writer and wife, Rachel, Fullbright wanted to pay homage to experiences they’ve had in their own lives. &lt;em&gt;Open Roads &lt;/em&gt;is a matriarchal story, with Tess and Opal digging into the unknown life of Tess’ grandmother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NFoMc"&gt;“I feel like there’s this moment in all of our lives where you have the grandparent that passes away,” says Gaynor. “In being exposed to the stuff they’ve left behind and having to sort through it, you discover things about them that maybe you never knew or that you’d forgotten about.” Part of that means playing with the idea of an unreliable narrator. Memories get jumbled, and personal experience colors recollection: “Can I find the real truth through the exploration that we’re doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xe5ll2"&gt;As for the attic box, Gaynor hasn’t been able to find the family to which it belongs. “It’s not ours to do something with,” he says, unwilling to throw it away. It serves as a reminder of what it felt like to put together the pieces of someone’s life with a loved one. “We wanted to pay homage … to that experience of finding out more about who those people really were, maybe after the point where you’re really able to talk to them about it,” he says of &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;. “Maybe it makes [the player] think about their own experience with those moments in their life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfRRIN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf8Iwl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtqox3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kHo1Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Oversight Board overturns hate speech and pandemic misinformation takedowns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AA9L5yBKvYRr-TwghAkRcg3QVXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734307/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H0ZI1U"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board has issued its first round of rulings, upholding one removal and overturning four decisions involving hate speech, nudity, and misinformation. Together, the rulings take an expansive view of what users can post under the current policies, based on concerns about vague rules and protecting freedom of expression online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l94zG4"&gt;The Oversight Board — composed of experts outside Facebook — accepted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;first set of cases&lt;/a&gt; in December. While the original slate included six incidents, a user in one case &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-KBHZS8BL/"&gt;proactively deleted their post&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the decision moot. Facebook has pledged to follow its rulings within seven days and respond to recommendations for new policies within 30 days. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-oversight-boards-first-decisions/"&gt;In a response to the rulings&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook said it had already restored all the content in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NADL0w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One case objected to Facebook’s automated takedown system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9M5USU"&gt;The five cases covered posts across four continents. In Brazil, the board &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-KBHZS8BL/"&gt;ruled in favor&lt;/a&gt; of a woman whose Instagram post about breast cancer was automatically removed for nudity. Facebook had already restored the photo, but the board objected to the initial removal, saying the fully automated decision “indicates the lack of proper human oversight which raises human rights concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VZWm7"&gt;Two other cases show the bounds of what the board considers hate speech. &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/436612660860568-oversight-board-upholds-facebook-decision-case-2020-003-fb-ua/"&gt;A panel upheld&lt;/a&gt; Facebook removing a Russian post with a demeaning slur against Azerbaijani people. But it &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/773985406543781-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2020-002-fb-ua/"&gt;overturned a decision&lt;/a&gt; in Myanmar, saying that while the post “might be considered offensive, it did not reach the level of hate speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYzqJa"&gt;The post was written in Burmese, and the decision was based on some fine translation differences. Facebook initially interpreted it as saying “[there is] something wrong with Muslims psychologically,” but a later translation rendered it as “[specific] male Muslims have something wrong in their mindset,” which was deemed “a commentary on the apparent inconsistency between Muslims’ reactions to events in France and in China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eccuU7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A post about Muslims in Myanmar was considered “offensive” but “did not reach the level of hate speech”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1VPTSG"&gt;As the Facebook board acknowledges, Myanmar is in the grips of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/23/myanmar-is-still-committing-genocide-against-rohingya-says-rights-group"&gt;an ongoing genocide&lt;/a&gt; against the Rohingya Muslim minority, incited partly through inflammatory Facebook posts. However, it declared that “statements referring to Muslims as mentally unwell or psychologically unstable are not a strong part of this rhetoric,” and “while the post might be considered pejorative or offensive towards Muslims, it did not advocate hatred or intentionally incite any form of imminent harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgmchb"&gt;Other decisions hinge on Facebook explaining its policies badly, rather than the specific content of the post. &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/141077647749726-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2020-005-fb-ua/"&gt;A US-based post&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, compared a quote from Nazi propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels to American political rhetoric. Facebook determined it violated hate speech policies because it didn’t explicitly condemn Goebbels, but “Facebook is not sufficiently clear that, when posting a quote attributed to a dangerous individual, the user must make clear that they are not praising or supporting them,” the board said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="D9ITgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board still hasn’t decided whether Facebook could ban Trump&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gqk6sT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/325131635492891-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2020-006-fb-fbr/"&gt;Another case&lt;/a&gt;, from France, referred falsely to hydroxychloroquine as a “cure” for COVID-19. But the reference was part of a comment about government policies, not an encouragement to take the drug, and the board said this didn’t rise to the level of causing “imminent harm.” The board said that Facebook’s rules about medical misinformation were “inappropriately vague and inconsistent with international human rights standards,” and it’s encouraged Facebook to publish clearer guidelines about what counts as “misinformation,” as well as a transparency report about how it has moderated COVID-19-related content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2TIcX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook suggests it won’t take a softer line on COVID-19 misinformation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tuwH0j"&gt;Facebook says it will apply the precedent from these rulings to similar content on the network, although it didn’t give a specific number of posts that were affected. It’s still formulating policy changes, but it discussed the medical misinformation case specifically, saying that its takedown approach “will not change” while the pandemic is ongoing. However, it plans to publish updated COVID-19-related policies soon. “It is critical for everyone to have access to accurate information, and our current approach in removing misinformation is based on extensive consultation with leading scientists, including from the CDC and WHO,” writes content policy vice president Monika Bickert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jh17sS"&gt;The Oversight Board says it will soon take on a new slate of cases, which can be drawn from user appeals or referred directly by Facebook. It will also open a public comment period for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;highest-profile case so far&lt;/a&gt;: whether Facebook and Instagram should indefinitely suspend former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0JCmM"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board — effectively a “supreme court” for the social network — was criticized for a slow rollout after its initial announcement last year. A separate group of activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/29/21472092/real-facebook-oversight-board-stunt-activism-limitations"&gt;calling themselves the “Real Facebook Oversight Board”&lt;/a&gt; have also called it too narrowly focused on putting content back online, rather than addressing whether Facebook should moderate &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; strictly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUCnsq"&gt;Stanford Cyber Policy Center &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/persily/status/1354806193005293570"&gt;co-director Nate Persily noted&lt;/a&gt; that individual decisions aren’t the only thing at stake in this set of rulings. “The results in these decisions are less important than the signals/precedent set for how the board will operate, how it considers its jurisdiction, what info about [Facebook] and its posts will be revealed in the decisions, and how ambitious the Board will be in checking Facebook,” he tweeted after the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lccNSA"&gt;Similar to a national Supreme Court, the Oversight Board’s decisions are supposed to help clarify Facebook’s complicated rules. Unlike a democratic nation, however, the company can easily change its own moderation policies, and Facebook is under no legal obligation to abide by the board’s rulings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Viper 8K promises the fastest performance of any gaming mouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Viper 8K" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s3Ik4Erc7kSGSENfg9JI5ypmdb0=/0x0:3358x2239/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734073/viper8k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Viper 8K weighs two grams more (71g) than the original Viper (69g).&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sKmd4N"&gt;Razer’s Viper 8K is a refresh of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750672/razer-viper-gaming-mouse-optical-switches-price-specs-features"&gt;2019 true ambidextrous Viper&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part, it’s identical and is now available at the same &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming%2Fmice%2Frazer-viper-8khz&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$79 asking price&lt;/a&gt;, but it has some key upgrades for competitive gamers who are hoping that tech might help them get the edge over their opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkRGQQ"&gt;First off, Razer now includes the Focus Plus 20,000DPI sensor used in many of its other 2020 mice, along with the latest generation of optical switches that have a more tactile click feel, according to the company (although it didn’t stand out as noticeable to me when I tested the mouse). The biggest news is that, according to Razer, the newly revised Viper can achieve the fastest polling rate of any mouse currently available: up to 8,000Hz — far higher than the industry standard of 1,000Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dvVGI"&gt;The polling rate measures how often per second the mouse tells your computer where it’s located on-screen. The more frequent the polling is, the smoother your mouse tracking can be. In the case of Razer’s new Viper 8K, an 8,000Hz polling rate can deliver a whopping 8,000 pings to your PC per second, while reducing the response time of those pings from one millisecond to just an eighth of one millisecond. On paper, it seems really impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Viper 8K" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fLH-L1NRBsujF6qNm8ZpNXVG2kA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260744/viper8k2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Viper 8K’s Speedflex is slightly thicker, a change made to better accommodate the increased polling rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lTwSOM"&gt;But why, exactly, would anyone need a polling rate this high? Razer says this is an upgrade that you won’t necessarily feel or notice right away since this improvement slices off mere fractions of a millisecond from the response time — something I’d wager most people couldn’t delineate. However, according to Razer, it could help your movement and aim feel more responsive, and gamers who play fast-paced games, like first-person shooters, are most likely to benefit from using this mouse — even if they don’t notice it happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB6GNG"&gt;Frankly, I didn’t notice a stark difference in gameplay while testing out &lt;em&gt;Ghostrunner&lt;/em&gt;, a first-person title that relies on fast reflexes. (I failed &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, but honestly, that’s nothing new.) I then tried to put Razer’s 8,000Hz polling rate claim to the test with some sites that track that metric. Tools made by &lt;a href="https://mouseinsider.com/mouse-polling-rate-checker/#info"&gt;Mouse Insider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zowie.benq.com/ja/support/mouse-rate-checker.html"&gt;Zowie&lt;/a&gt; recorded a 4,700Hz average polling rate for this mouse. There were a few times it peaked into 5,000Hz, so it seems like it could go higher if it were physically possible for me to move my hand any faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Viper" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWHE1MW8c3cmtmuBUgkR36T861s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18369101/akrales_190730_3573_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a picture of the original Viper. The new Viper 8K looks exactly the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u4r8sB"&gt;Your PC hardware may also play a factor. Razer requested that press who were going to test the mouse have access to PCs with at least an Intel Core i5-8600K or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 processor, an Nvidia GTX 1080 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 or better graphics processor, and a high refresh-rate monitor at 144Hz or over. Thankfully, you don’t actually need a PC that high-end to use this mouse. Razer’s Synapse software lets you revert the polling rate to 125, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000Hz. However, since the main objective of the Viper 8K is to make your experience smoother with its high polling rate, you’ll take better advantage of this mouse’s specs if you have at least a midrange system with a high refresh rate monitor and powerful hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05EzLo"&gt;I expect other peripheral companies will launch similar mice with high polling rates, though if you feel your needs are being met with current tech, you probably don’t need to get too excited about this feature just yet. But if you need a new mouse, this isn’t a bad choice. I like using this mouse as much as I did the original Viper. And the fast polling rate tech won’t cost you anything extra to attain since the Viper 8K is the same price as its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors, maker of giant trucks and SUVs, vows to be carbon neutral by 2040</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S.-ILLINOIS-GM-AUTO SALES-FALLING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4eZBc-hehIjJER7aeVcvzaDp7Ss=/20x0:6529x4339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734083/1230446564.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Xinhua/Joel Lerner via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1xwv5W"&gt;General Motors, an automotive company that sells hundreds of thousands of giant gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs every year, says it will be carbon neutral by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrZzfE"&gt;The company says it will achieve this goal by “removing emissions from all our products, including every vehicle we produce, and all of our global operations in the next twenty years.” And when removing those emissions aren’t possible, GM says it will purchase carbon credits to offset the pollution for which it is responsible. Notably, though, GM wouldn’t commit to ending its sale of gas-powered vehicles within its targeted time frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B58Oq"&gt;The announcement comes a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;President Joe Biden signed a series of executive orders&lt;/a&gt; aimed at combating climate change. The new administration has provided an opportunity to GM to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;fully embrace the electrification of its vehicle lineup&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;shrug off its past support&lt;/a&gt; of Donald Trump’s effort to allow vehicles to pollute more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="piP8UO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM wouldn’t commit to ending its sale of gas-powered vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HqWEit"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;recently committed&lt;/a&gt; to spending $27 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025 — up from the $20 billion it announced before the COVID-19 pandemic. GM has also said it will launch 30 new electric vehicles around the world during that time period, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2X5DW"&gt;GM is the largest automaker in North America. As such, its effort to eliminate carbon emissions from its manufacturing operations, supply chain, and from the tailpipes of all its vehicles is sure to be a massive effort, and not one where victory is assured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvRx6s"&gt;By 2030, GM says it will use “100 percent renewable energy” to power its US plants and facilities — and for global facilities by 2035. These are often referred to as Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions come from a company’s end-of-use products and supply chain, and are arguably much harder to eliminate. But GM says it aims to achieve the eradication of Scope 3 emissions, which make up 75 percent of the company’s total carbon output, by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfRlKE"&gt;But the company is also giving itself some wiggle room. In a LinkedIn post, GM CEO Mary Barra describes the goal of eliminating tailpipe emissions from its new light-duty vehicles by 2035 as “an aspiration” rather than a certainty. And during a conference call with reporters, when asked whether the company planned to stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2035, GM’s chief sustainability officer Dane Parker indicated that it wasn’t totally up to GM to make that decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhrmxI"&gt;“What we really need is the efforts of all these groups we’ve mentioned combined,” Parker said, citing partnerships with environmental groups and governments to build the infrastructure to support electric vehicle charging, for example, as well as all of the companies in GM’s vast supply chain. “And so in some ways, this is a great example of ‘it takes a village.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyrfqh"&gt;A likely scenario, for example, is that GM continues to roll out new electric vehicles while also selling gas-powered models and using the purchase of carbon credits, as it has said it will do, to offset the CO2 created by those vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBAa5D"&gt;Purchasing offsets have become a standard way for car companies and other businesses to write off their carbon emissions, by investing in renewable energy or conservation projects aimed at bolstering forests’ ability to naturally store carbon. But there’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;offsets haven’t succeeded&lt;/a&gt; in slowing global warming, and have instead given companies a license to keep polluting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iah65z"&gt;GM is the latest company in the transportation sector to commit to carbon neutrality. Volvo said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915841/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-suv-specs-miles-range-reveal"&gt;reduce its carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt; by 2025. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169798/united-airlines-emissions-carbon-capture-climate-change-goal"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137782/delta-carbon-neutral-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-airlines"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-climatechange/uber-jetblue-join-amazon-backed-climate-pledge-idUSKBN28C24H"&gt;JetBlue&lt;/a&gt; said they would eliminate all of their emissions over the next several decades. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294040/lyft-electric-vehicle-ev-100-percent-2030"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; have both pledged to go carbon neutral within a similar timeframe as GM. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These great-sounding Master &amp; Dynamic earbuds are $80 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fw2L3-7hsgLzfTPLn2ssnPGfFnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733962/akrales_191016_3736_0085.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="knEHLH"&gt;If you are in the market for a new pair of wireless earbuds and want something with an unconventional design, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730705444314954977" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic’s MW07 Go true wireless earbuds are $120 at Best Buy today&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $80 off their usual price of $200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KjOmr"&gt;At first glance, the MW07 Go look like they might be uncomfortable inside your ears, but don’t let the looks fool you. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Cameron Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20918033/master-dynamic-mw07-plus-go-truly-wireless-headphones-review-noise-cancellation"&gt;reviewed these earbuds&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and noted they are much more comfortable than their appearance suggests. These buds also have great sound, last up to 10 hours on a single charge, and include a USB-C charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wOQbqv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10307496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoUJpn"&gt;Amazon is currently selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GL575DB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=de5de8aafbde3b5c94a5a0a78a57cf3c&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 980 Pro NVMe M.2 SSD with 500GB for $112 today&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $150, this is the lowest price we have seen this internal SSD marked down yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YJ4Dm"&gt;If you are planning to buy this SSD, there are a few things to keep in mind: it’s PCIe 4.0-ready (but fully compatible with PCIe 3.0 motherboards), so if you want to take full advantage of this SSD, you will need to have cutting-edge PC parts in your build. Secondly, if you own a PS5 and are hoping to expand your internal storage, the PS5 has a slot for an M.2 drive like this, but Sony doesn’t support expandable SSD storage yet. But because the 980 Pro is PCIe 4.0-ready, it will likely be a solid contender once the PS5 does add support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NifqOJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10307515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ujJX0R"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is once again selling a &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL for only $300&lt;/a&gt;. Even though this phone is nearly three years old, it’s still a solid contender for those looking for a solid stock Android device with powerful front and rear cameras. This phone comes equipped with Android 11, and Google has confirmed it will receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which will arrive later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="abvXOh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gsZCys"&gt;At Best Buy, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729961514897653331" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock plus four LED smart bulbs for just $30&lt;/a&gt;, which is $65 off its usual price of $95. This bundle will allow you to take full advantage of Google Assistant and add some smarts to a specific room in your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xjLePh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10293534"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft turned its sustainability report into a Minecraft map</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5eui9zu7Gs_80HFpdIHS40rOYMc=/9x0:1458x966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733501/Sustainability_City_Map_A.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TFuzuS"&gt;Microsoft released its annual sustainability report today, and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; developer Mojang decided to turn it into something interactive. Called simply “&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/01/28/minecraft-releases-free-sustainability-city-map/"&gt;Sustainable City&lt;/a&gt;,” the new &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; map is available as a free download in the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; marketplace, and it’s also been added to the game’s educational offshoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yrlyjl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Minecraft Education is perfectly suited for this surreal back-to-school moment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21377192/minecraft-education-edition-back-to-school-pandemic"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0SLNI"&gt;The map features six included lessons, which Mojang says are “designed to give students a sense of stewardship for the planet.” The lessons cover topics like sustainable food production, water outflow and treatment, and responsible forestry. One lesson tasks players with exploring a home built entirely from sustainable materials; another has them venture to a landfill to learn what happens to non-recyclable materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWUTe3"&gt;The educational version of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; has been around since 2016, but it has become especially popular of late &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377192/minecraft-education-edition-back-to-school-pandemic"&gt;due to the rise in remote learning&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Microsoft says more than 35 million students and educators are licensed to use the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood blocks purchase of GameStop, AMC, and BlackBerry stock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nyse-stockexchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jbwuQFGWKBD9PRAt2Rpb5xisSD4=/0x8:1024x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68733493/nyse_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xx89ZX"&gt;Robinhood &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility"&gt;has added new limits&lt;/a&gt; to its app to restrict users from buying or trading any of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit r/WallStreetBets stocks&lt;/a&gt;, including GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more. Users will still be allowed to close out existing positions but won’t be able to buy more of the stocks. The company is citing “recent volatility” in the market as the reasoning behind the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1611842701391_195"&gt;We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zBGr3V"&gt;The development is the latest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;an ongoing saga&lt;/a&gt; that has seen a group of Reddit users from the WallStreetBets subreddit band together in an effort to drive up the stock prices of companies like GameStop and BlackBerry, in defiance of traditional hedge funds that had shorted those firms. Robinhood — a popular stock market application that allows amateur day traders to purchase those stocks without fees — has been a key tool in the Reddit group’s ability to push prices up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ahr9Bt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"},{"title":"Memes have broken the brokerages","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GWccmk"&gt;Robinhood isn’t the only major company to stop accepting new trades for GameStop and AMC — more traditional brokerages like Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;restricted trading&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, citing unprecedented trading activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwyu8"&gt;The move has infuriated members of the WallStreetBets subreddit. A top post on the subreddit this morning &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6w4uo/robinhood_will_not_let_new_options_or_shares_be/"&gt;calls the decision&lt;/a&gt; “market manipulation,” with angry comments calling for users to “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6w4uo/robinhood_will_not_let_new_options_or_shares_be/gl31cfs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;dump robinhood for good&lt;/a&gt;” and lamenting the ensuring fall in stock prices that shortly followed the announcement. The group’s official moderator account has also protested the decision by Robinhood, highlighting the unfairness of the fact that day traders cannot make new investments in the stocks when traditional firms still can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b0uZ4Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Individual investors are being stripped of their ability to trade on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RobinhoodApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile hedge funds and institutional investors can continue to trade as normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you call a market that removes retail investors ability to buy to save institutional investors shorts? &lt;a href="https://t.co/G0hQFJDaG4"&gt;https://t.co/G0hQFJDaG4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— wsb mod (@wsbmod) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1354783317908971520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWy4Rt"&gt;The move by Robinhood has already attracted the attention of lawmakers, with Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1354807292667981828"&gt;posting on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the decision was “beyond absurd,” and calling for a hearing by The House Committee on Financial Services on “Robinhood’s market manipulation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6jnc4v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is beyond absurd. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FSCDems?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FSCDems&lt;/a&gt; need to have a hearing on Robinhood's market manipulation. They're blocking the ability to trade to protect Wall St. hedge funds, stealing millions of dollars from their users to protect people who've used the stock market as a casino for decades. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CGkJxVfzkv"&gt;https://t.co/CGkJxVfzkv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1354807292667981828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hjBm4r"&gt;A sticked post on the thread from moderators also implores users “No witch hunts on Robinhood please.” It’s a reflection on the recent turmoil that has hit the /r/WallStreetBets community as part of its nearly overnight success, which has seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;group’s Discord server banned&lt;/a&gt; for “hateful and discriminatory content” and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253339/reddit-wallstreetbets-subreddit-private-gamestop"&gt;subreddit itself temporarily made private&lt;/a&gt; as the group struggles to moderate the massive influx of new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQcuPF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 28th, 10:40am: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added tweet from Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) on Robinhood’s block of purchases. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
