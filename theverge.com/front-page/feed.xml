    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The PS5 gets a family-friendly blockbuster&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4EnCHl"&gt;There were times during &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, the latest entry in the &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; series, when I felt like treasure hunter Nathan Drake. Buildings collapsed around me as I made my way through perfectly tuned action set pieces, and I’d manage to jump out of the way of each explosion at &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the right second. The only difference, of course, is &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is much cuter — think of it like a sci-fi, family-friendly take on &lt;em&gt;Uncharted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GS8JNT"&gt;A combination of shooter and platformer, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; has always been a series closely associated with PlayStation, and the last game — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/11/11407724/ratchet-and-clank-ps4-review-animated-movie"&gt;a 2016 reboot of the original&lt;/a&gt; — showed that it could also be a technical showcase. &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, might just be the most pivotal entry in the franchise to date. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465232/god-of-war-ragnorok-ps5-ps4-delay-2022"&gt;cross-generation releases&lt;/a&gt;, true PS5 exclusives still remain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;vanishingly rare&lt;/a&gt;, even months into the console’s life. But &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is exactly that: a game you can only play on Sony’s next-gen console and one that actually takes advantage of the new hardware. It also happens to be an extremely fun adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0AzfZ"&gt;Though the series dates back to 2002, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is largely a standalone story. It stars a fuzzy little fox creature named Ratchet (he’s actually an alien called a Lombax, believed to be the last of his kind) and his adorable robot companion Clank. As a nice intro for new players (and a refresher for longtime fans), the game starts with the pair being honored for their past achievements in a parade-like setting in front of a huge crowd of adoring onlookers. It even serves as a clever mini-tutorial — but it’s not long before the celebration is interrupted when longtime villain Dr. Nefarious attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="pGHf06"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikOXfti0bVI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="skbFWS"&gt;The core of &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is a device that can open up portals between dimensions. After yet another defeat, Nefarious uses the device to go to a dimension where he always wins — and he accidentally brings Ratchet and Clank along in the process. The two become separated. Ratchet is on his own for a while before befriending a tiny bot named Kit, while Clank teams up with another Lombax named Rivet. It’s a clever setup that has the new duos jumping across planets, searching for sci-fi MacGuffins to fix the device and return the dimensions back to normal. The setup is also great because it allows you to play as both characters in a way that feels organic; often, you have a choice of which planet to explore, and you’ll control whichever Lombax is closest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="v8BljU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10595453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QdH344"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly a series known for its narrative, but &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; pushes things quite a bit forward. The new characters, in particular, are a great addition, turning it from a wise-cracking caper into a story with real heart (though there are still lots of wisecracks). Rivet starts out as a pessimistic loner, but you get to watch her slowly learn how to trust and work with people, thanks to Clank’s calming presence. Likewise, for most of the game, Kit has a hard time connecting with anyone for reasons that become clear once you learn her surprisingly dark backstory. But this leads to some heartbreaking moments. At one point, in a fit of frustration, she yells, “Why do none of you understand? I am broken. I will always &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; broken!” This is not the level of emotional awareness I expected from a series with a character named Skidd McMarx. There are even side missions where you can learn more about Lombax lore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fJSS8"&gt;The film-like quality of &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is heightened by the visuals. Simply put, the game looks incredible. I’ve said this about past games in the series, most notably the 2016 release on PS4, but it’s even more true now: playing &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is like being inside a gorgeous animated film. There’s a level of detail that you rarely see in games. You’ll venture through a densely packed sci-fi city that puts anything in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; to shame and glide across desert wastelands, creepy underwater research facilities, and an incredibly charming gas station in space. It’s all rendered in a kid-friendly way but also with a sense of realism, whether it’s the gleam of a metallic robot or the fuzz on an alien sheep. Every time I saw Ratchet’s furry ears up close, I wanted to give him a pet and tell him he’s a good boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6LFOS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t just look great, but it runs incredibly well, too. I didn’t experience any slowdown during my time with the game, despite the fact that battles get pretty wild, with dozens of enemies on-screen and all kinds of projectiles flinging about. &lt;em&gt;Ratchet&lt;/em&gt; is a series defined in part by its inventive weaponry; you’ll have guns that shoot razor blades, encase enemies in blocks of ice, and — my personal favorite — a grenade that launches a sprinkler, covering everything it touches in beautiful green foliage. Battles involve constantly switching between weapons and firing off all kinds of strange bombs and bullets, and yet I didn’t experience a single hiccup or stutter while playing. (&lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; also offers three different graphics options: “fidelity,” which runs at 30fps and features ray tracing, better lighting, and 4K support; “performance RT,” with 60fps and ray tracing, but lower resolution and fewer details and visual density; and “performance” which runs at 60fps but features increased resolution in place of ray-tracing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQL82DUkDJe4rlj-8GVrq00gy1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643369/RACRA_Flyer.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFJBLa"&gt;Perhaps even more impressive is that this happens with barely any noticeable load times. When you venture to a new planet, there’s a brief clip showing your ship taking off, but once you’re in a level, there’s no loading whatsoever. Likewise, the game transitions between cutscenes and gameplay seamlessly, to the point that sometimes I didn’t realize I had to pick the controller back up. One of the most impressive things in the game are the titular rifts. Essentially they’re cracks between dimensions, and you can see — and often enter — them to head to a completely different world. It’s wild standing in front of one and just staring through at a totally different location and then jumping into it without any friction whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdMzNY"&gt;At its most basic, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is a fairly standard action platformer. There are some nice diversions, including a side story involving a spider-bot that kills computer viruses, and a series of tricky puzzle rooms that reminded me a bit of the shrines from &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. But for the most part, you’re running around and shooting things. It’s straightforward, but it works: the gunplay is fun, there’s an almost overwhelming amount of variety in the weapons, and lots of cool spaces to move around in. At one point, you’re even riding a dragon. But all of this is elevated by how beautiful the game looks and how well it runs. &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of game where I keep stopping just to ogle at seemingly simple things like waves in water or the reflection on a glass cockpit. It shows the importance of aesthetics and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QBVBtm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Returnal is dark, challenging, and the perfect PS5 showcase","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvUY52"&gt;That said, the game is relatively linear. For the most part, that’s not an issue. The levels are big enough that you can still poke around and you never really feel boxed in. It also helps keep you from getting lost. (If you do, you can see your destination with a simple click of the right stick.) But what this does mean is that, much like in &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;, the big action set pieces follow a very specific path. When it works, it’s incredible, like you’re controlling an action movie sequence in real time. But if you miss a step or are unsure of what to do, everything falls apart. There were multiple times where I had to replay the same sequence a whole bunch of times because I missed the best way to time a jump or didn’t see a ramp with a speed boost on it. These moments are relatively rare, but they stand out because everything else is so seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgOSXY"&gt;I should also note that &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; makes great use of the PS5’s controller. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;aside from launch showcase &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it might be the best DualSense game so far. In one early sequence, for example, you have to find a dance club in a bustling alien city, and you’re able to do it by following the music through vibrations you feel in your hands. I especially loved how some of the weapons made use of the two states of the controller’s triggers; one lets you give a slight press to activate a shield, but when you push it all the way down, that shield turns into a destructive blast. It’s an intuitive way to add depth to the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gAGSd8"&gt;For the most part, &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t stray far from what has made &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; so enduring. The formula remains the same: silly characters, great graphics, and lots of interesting guns to play with. But virtually every element is better than it’s ever been, from the touching-if-goofy story to the frantic action set pieces. And through this &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; becomes a showcase for why someone might go through all the trouble to secure a PS5. It shows how more detailed worlds and faster load times can elevate a tried-and-true formula — and it might even make you care about Lombax lore in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XMJXa"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on the PlayStation 5 on June 11th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ten years of breaches in one image</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of an orange triangle with an exclamation mark over an abstract timeline with circles representing events." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1UzqCXgiSxGpEcJ1XWEn6QNiozw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69405661/VRG_4614_6_YearsofBreaches.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Nearly 8 billion usernames have leaked since June 2011&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="teeFGT"&gt;This is a map of the internet’s biggest sources of breached data, from June 2011 to today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDvkQn"&gt;The data is drawn from Troy Hunt’s &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; project (with minor adjustments), so you can click through to the site to see if you’re included. Each bubble represents a single breach, and as you scroll down, you’ll see them getting bigger and coming faster, until the sheer volume is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbhTt0"&gt;Crucially, they build on each other: if your favorite password didn’t leak out in the Dropbox breach, hackers could have gotten it from LinkedIn, Yahoo, or hundreds of others. (This, as you probably know, is why you need a unique password for each service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUaEKs"&gt;This isn’t a comprehensive list of every breach in history — it’s a safe bet we don’t know about some yet — but it’s a good survey of the login credentials available on the internet today. We’ve included a cumulative scale marker to give a sense of the full scope. We were a little surprised to find that the database contains more usernames than there are human beings alive on Earth. Of course, with more than 500 separate breaches, there’s ample opportunity for human beings to double up on leaked accounts but the scale of compromised information is still staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HMEBg"&gt;We usually talk about breaches as isolated incidents, like a single point of failure with a specific cause and effect. But seen from this vantage, the story is less about any single company, and more about the all-consuming entropy of information online. Something is always breaking, some secret is always slipping out. The real work of cybersecurity is managing that entropy — building a raft of stability in a system where all credentials may eventually be breached and all protections may eventually break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="1Q5A17"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/6366171"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Kishi for Android is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Kishi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wm-rnZckZ7fUXyXuwWihYRFo2YE=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421938/cfaulkner_200604_4054_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It can fit almost any Android phone, aside from the Galaxy S20 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KV7TDO"&gt;The Razer Kishi is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;best mobile controllers out there&lt;/a&gt;, and you can get it for significantly less than it usually costs at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X8DHN2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742848825048987882#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $80, the version of the controller made for Android costs $55. The Kishi is compact, yet it can expand to fit most phones (excluding the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra). It features passthrough USB-C charging, and its overall design looks like a Nintendo Switch, but people who are used to gaming on an Xbox Series X controller should feel at home with the feel and arrangement of the Kishi’s buttons, sticks and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fYS9lr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10228224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z4wZy"&gt;We saw a few fire sales on Microsoft’s Surface Duo folding Android phone last month, and &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13112648?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-dual-screen-lte-tablets-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is back with another one&lt;/a&gt; — just for AT&amp;amp;T subscribers, though. You can get a new Surface Duo with 128GB of storage for $550 or double the storage for $620. Either one comes with a one-year warranty from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6IJido"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10517551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtNvo1"&gt;The latest pre-Prime Day deal that Amazon is running is a TV promo that loops in Toshiba’s 50-inch 4K Fire TV Edition model that has Dolby Vision HDR. It’s one of the best Fire TV Edition models you can buy, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086VR2KY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and through Saturday, it’s $310 for Prime members&lt;/a&gt; instead of $430. In case you aren’t aware, Fire TV Edition means that Amazon’s streaming software is built into the TV, so you can get right to streaming Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more shortly after you turn it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wa4KZj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nIjNk6"&gt;If you have a significantly bigger budget for a 4K TV, consider checking out Amazon and Best Buy’s deals on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/l/17985366011?offerId=pcb-UINY1BDSUQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony 4K TVs and LG OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll get 10 percent back on one of these TVs if you purchase at Amazon with a Prime credit card). The 55-inch LG A1 OLED is $200 off at $1,400, and it comes close to having feature parity with more expensive models in LG’s lineup. Keep in mind that it has one fewer HDMI port (three versus four) and its processor is from a previous generation of OLEDs. Notably, this OLED has a 60Hz refresh rate, so it won’t be ideal for gaming at fast refresh rates like pricier OLEDs are, though it’ll still look amazing on this display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BGr0AZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WV8w7"&gt;If you do want an OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate and support for AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, consider stepping up to the LG C1 OLED. The 48-inch model costs the same as the 55-inch A1 above &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED55C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFK81RH?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at $1,400&lt;/a&gt;. The 55-inch model is $1,600, and we’ve included links for that model below. Retailer BuyDig is honoring this deal, as well, but it includes a $50 Visa gift card and a complimentary four-year accidental warranty with purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JBl9TJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596469"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="65upQQ"&gt;There’s a $10 discount happening on physical versions of &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster&lt;/em&gt; for PS4 and the Nintendo Switch. You can find the game available with this small price cut at Best Buy and Amazon, costing $40 instead of $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5u4Avb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596477"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="kdWNeq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The next generation of startups is remote</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8vNBsGOsV8VZsi-yPebZ1Eqp27w=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421833/VRG_ILLO_4623_Decoder_Michael_Seibel_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Y Combinator’s Michael Seibel on startups after the pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3Gq35G"&gt;My guest on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; this week is Michael Seibel, managing director of Y Combinator, one of the most well-known and successful startup incubators in Silicon Valley. YC has funded some of the biggest names in tech, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe. It’s a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hNOGc"&gt;Michael is also a co-founder of Justin.tv, known now as Twitch, and he recently joined the board at Reddit after co-founder Alexis Ohanian stepped down and asked the company to replace him with someone who is Black. That means Michael is uniquely suited to talk about a lot of things that I’m really interested in exploring on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;: starting and growing tech businesses, finding opportunities for new ideas, the growing creator economy, and making sure the next generation of business leaders doesn’t look exactly the same as the last one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXSN96"&gt;Micheal and I sat down last week and had a really direct, really interesting conversation about all those things. Then a couple days later, two startup founders who had been a part of Y Combinator &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ycombinator-katia-damer-paul-biggar-criticized-founders-vaccine-line-skipping-2021-6"&gt;tweeted that they had been kicked out of the program&lt;/a&gt; for criticizing it. One founder, Paul Biggar, said he was kicked out for tweeting about other founders skipping vaccine lines in March, and another, Katia Damer, said she was kicked out for raising issues with the program she thought were misogynistic. “YC has systematically disadvantaged female founders for years,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAVnbI"&gt;These are big issues, and given that Michael and I had specifically talked about making it easier for diverse founders to succeed, I invited him to come back and talk about them. He declined, and Y Combinator sent along the following statement, which, you will note, does not address the substance of the issues at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2FayUg"&gt;We don’t provide details into why people get removed from the YC community, but both tweet threads are not accurate. They were not removed for the content of their posts but for breaking the terms of the community. One of our most important rules: we don’t share anything from the forum with anyone outside of YC. This is a community built on trust and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o0F4or"&gt;I don’t really know what to make of that statement, especially because one of the things Michael talked about the most passionately in our conversation was demystifying YC by widely and openly sharing information. And the criticisms of YC on display here are not new, so I thought it would be appropriate for Michael to come and explain all of this himself. We followed up, we tried to make the case, and we were told Michael was unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qj2rpp"&gt;I do think there’s a lot in this conversation worth thinking about, and I did enjoy speaking with Michael. But I talk to a lot of leaders about making decisions on this show, and I have to say, I don’t understand that decision at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="X4Z4wQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcript has been edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dAdgB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Seibel, you’re a managing director at Y Combinator, which is one of the most famous startup incubators in the world. You are also the co-founder of both Socialcam and Justin.tv, which is the company that became Twitch. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki7XMT"&gt;Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGgNSI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s my understanding of what YC does: Y Combinator takes small investments and very small, scrappy startup teams. You put them through a bootcamp, which has gained somewhat mythical and legendary status for how rigorous it is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyOveu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then you have a pitch session called Demo Day, which also has a somewhat mythical status. And that Demo Day helps people get larger rounds of funding. That seems very simple, but like I said, there’s a lot of myth around it. I know there’s a lot of actual process inside of Y Combinator. Walk people through that entire cycle and kind of demystify it a little bit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdKLq2"&gt;I’m happy to. I think we want to start with, what were the problems that YC was created to solve? The first problem for any founder raising funding traditionally is that they needed warm introductions, they needed preexisting relationships. The second problem is, they have to know all the best practices around creating a deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YymTeY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A PowerPoint deck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQXFGd"&gt;PowerPoint deck, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSnTS6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a very small but very big problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOqlD9"&gt;Exactly. It’s actually extremely scrutinized and, I think, almost silly. It reminds me of, like, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsLUidiYm0w"&gt;TPS report in &lt;em&gt;Office Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in its stupidity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmiGoi"&gt;The third problem is they’re negotiating against an investor first. So the first relationship with the investor is a negotiation and one that’s not transparent. They don’t know if the company before them or after them raised more or less, or got better or worse terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yMGPN"&gt;The fourth problem is, for the longest time, technical people were not being funded. Only business people, only people with MBAs. And the fifth problem was that after funding, the relationship was only with the investor. The founder wasn’t given a community of founders to learn from, to get support from, to grow with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xC1Pp"&gt;YC was essentially created to solve all five of those problems. And so if we go through; one, you don’t have to know us. All you have to do is go to the website and apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hve1Ax"&gt;Two, you don’t have to do a deck. Literally all you have to do is fill out an application that’s kind of like a college application or a job application, which most people have done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HETBIf"&gt;Three, you don’t have to negotiate with us. &lt;a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/deal/"&gt;All of our terms&lt;/a&gt; are right on the website, both the general terms and the legal documents. So before you even ask us for money, you know the exact terms we’ll invest at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt4pag"&gt;Four, we put you in a cohort of other companies so that you’re not only getting help from us, but you’re getting a community of people who can help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeanyT"&gt;And that’s YC. That’s what makes it great. And so it turns out that those problems still exist, even though YC’s 16 years old. And that’s why, you know, 16,000 companies apply to YC every six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfHlrZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y Combinator was started to solve those problems. In some ways, you have helped to solve a lot of them. Those problems will continue to exist; you will continue to try to solve them. But after 16 years, Y Combinator is kind of the center of the universe for startup accelerators. It has gravity. It is very influential, the way that it works, influences how other people do things, how other accelerators are started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeSzWu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re not in that disruptor lane anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJ3Ym1"&gt;I don’t know that we’re not in that disruptor phase. Most successful companies still don’t do accelerators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdr8re"&gt;I would argue that most founders today are still starting their process by negotiating with normal investors and confronting those same problems. I would say that there are more investors now, and certainly more investors are tech-friendly and founder-friendly, than they used to be 16 years ago. What’s interesting is that half of YC’s investments now are international. And in those communities, they look like the Valley in 2005 or even worse in terms of founder friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="752qMA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qIHrJq"&gt;I don’t think the disrupting task isn’t done yet. Now, of course, there’s new things that we’re doing too, that we didn’t do in 2005. But I would say that man, if the disrupting task was done, if all founders didn’t have to encounter those five problems I mentioned in the beginning, I’d retire. I’d be like, “Hey, we changed our community for the better.” But to speak to the new challenges, what’s interesting about the group of people who run YC now is that so many of us were YC alums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkLSXW"&gt;I did YC in 2007, and then again in 2012. And during that period of time, YC was really just focused on the batch. And one of the things that alums always talked about was, “What are the other services YC could provide you after the batch?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhgxb8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After you graduate and you’ve gotten your investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnGroR"&gt;After you’ve raised your seed round. And, we came up with this tag phrase, you know, “YC is with you from cradle to IPO.” But we had to kind of ask ourselves, “Well, what are we doing after the batch?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSboh6"&gt;And so what’s been great is in the last six years or so, we’ve really stacked more products post-batch for our alumni. We have a program called Series A to B, which is a program for companies after they’ve raised their Series A to help them figure out, how do you encounter the next stages, the next challenges of a company post-Series A? We actually put them in a new batch of YC companies, and a smaller batch, so they had to have new peers who are at their stage. We have a growth program for companies that are way post-product market fit. They’re really focusing on hiring and company scaling, building out an executive team. Once again, put them in a new batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiiCyx"&gt;And we have the Continuity Fund, which is a growth fund that can actually write $25, $50, $75 million checks in the companies that are further along. We also have a little product that I love, that I desperately wished existed when I was going through YC, which is called Work At a Startup. So we basically built a common application that allows anyone to apply to all YC companies at the same time. So anyone who wants to work at a startup, they can apply on one website. And then all of our companies can sort through the people who are applying, reach out to them. And the really cool part about that product is, for the most part, founders are the ones using it, not recruiters. So if you apply with Work At a Startup and you look interesting, a founder will actually reach out to and engage with you, which I think is a completely unique experience. So we gotta nail the early stage, and then we have to figure out at every stage of our companies, how do we help them succeed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlx1Vx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds like a lot of work. How does Y Combinator make money on the back of all that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNOdeQ"&gt;We invest, so we’re an investment shop. So for YC, the standard deal that every early-stage company agrees to is, we invest $125,000 for 7 percent of the company. And then Continuity is a growth fund, they invest at whatever market terms founders are interested in. And so we make money as a fund. What’s interesting about YC, though, is just how much of the operation of the fund is funneling back into, “How do we make our program better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffYw0w"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The early program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6Qdda"&gt;How do we make the early program better? How do we make the Series A to B program better? How do we make the growth program better? Basically, a lot of what we’re trying to do is figure out how to give our companies more and more advantages as opposed to just how to line our pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dpcieb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said 16,000 companies apply now. That’s a lot more than in the beginning. You have multiple batches per year&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;How big are the current batches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opCsed"&gt;The current batches range anywhere from between 300 to 400 companies. And you mentioned applications increasing, it’s crazy. In the last 10 years, applications have increased 20 [times]. And YC has around a 2 percent admissions rate. So it’s still pretty hard to get in, but as more and more talented founders have applied, our strict goal has been, “How do we make sure YC can scale to support as many deserving founders and companies, as possible?” So as more apply, we figure out how to make YC bigger and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXBBgC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ask every executive for their decision-making process. I feel like with you, there’s only one decision-making process people want to know about. How do you decide who gets into a YC batch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gno897"&gt;I think what is so weird about YC is that because we’re funding batches of companies, we have a very different decision-making process than a normal investor. You know, a normal Series A investor might only write two checks a year. The other thing that’s different about YC is a lot of companies change, iterate, pivot after getting into YC. So you can’t get too caught up in the idea. And the third challenge we have is that we’re often among the first investors. So we have founders who are aiming for some moment 10 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ifgXf"&gt;We have this saying, we don’t want to be too smart. We don’t want to be too thesis-driven. We don’t really know how the world’s going to be 10 years from now. Founders invent that world. And so the more opinionated we are about their idea or their market, the more we’re being too smart. So what do we look for? That’s a bunch of stuff we don’t really care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="c7mEzY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The founder goes from doer to inspirer when the product works&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2wpfz"&gt;What are the things we care about? First, does the team have the ability to build the product? You know, our original DNA of YC was funding technical founders. And the reason why was because we felt like they had an advantage in building a product in a software world. That’s still core. So almost all of our teams have a technical co-founder and can build the product themselves. They’re not relying on contractors or consultants or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5zgSj"&gt;Number two, does the team have a preexisting relationship? It’s extremely stressful to do a startup. And YC is stressful as a program as well. If the team has some preexisting personal or work relationship, the founders have some confidence that that relationship will survive the stress. [If] the founders met two weeks ago — harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b71Zgb"&gt;Three, can the founders clearly communicate what they’re working on? Now, this is one that, like, I never understood as a founder. I was like, “Judge me on my graphs. If my graphs are going up, give me money.” And I think what I didn’t realize was that the founder’s journey goes from being kind of “doer” to “inspirer” when the product works. And so one of the things you’re trying to figure out is, “Can these folks inspire the 10 employees, the 100 employees, the 1,000 employees who will ultimately be the doers in the company?” And it’s really hard to inspire people if you don’t communicate clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMpPt6"&gt;The next one that we try to figure out is, what is your connection to the problem? Like, what is going on? Why do you care about this customer, about this problem? And if we go a step deeper, are you going to care about this problem for the next one year or the next five years or the next 10 years? Because the startup journey takes a long time. We’re really trying to figure out, are you in this kind of get-rich-quick category, or is there something deeper tying you to this problem that you’re solving that’s going to keep you motivated over the long time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GXhfV"&gt;And then I think the last thing that we think about a lot is how much have you accomplished in the period of time you’ve been working? I think there’s a set of founders who basically believe that step one in their company is to raise money. And so you’ll see some folks who, “Oh, we’ve been doing our startup for two years. We haven’t built a product yet. We’ve just been pitching the whole time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8dAwH"&gt;As opposed to teams where they’re saying, “Hey, look, we’re technical. We can build. Even if we have to do it nights and weekends [be]cause we’re bootstrapping, we want to get the first version of the product out there. We want to drive, get the first 10 customers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO0xtZ"&gt;We want to look at how long you’ve been working in the startup and what you’ve accomplished, and we want to be impressed and a little afraid because we believe that if you can accomplish a lot with a little, then if given more resources, you can do even more. So that’s what we look at. And to be honest, we default positive. Like, if you’re telling us this is a problem, we’ll kind of assume it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82iSPV"&gt;If you’re telling us this is a big market, we’ll kind of assume it is. Like our job isn’t to kind of second-guess your idea, it’s really to figure out, can you execute towards it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMFgmV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you square that with how often Y Combinator companies pivot inside the bootcamp? That’s maybe the most common story; you get accepted to YC, it was really hard. You got an idea. You’re a week in. “Oh man, that idea collapsed.” You pivot, and suddenly something else entirely exists. How do you square all of that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lh3jiA"&gt;You know what’s funny? We aren’t great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jm4ChS"&gt;[To] put it another way. We aspire to hit all of those points that I mentioned. I wouldn’t even give us an A at doing it. Maybe a B, maybe a B minus. And so what’s cool about our model is that it accommodates that. What’s also cool about our model is sometimes those pivots are good. I was co-founder of Justin.tv. We pivoted to Twitch, it worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qM20VI"&gt;Sometimes in the process of working on your startup, you learn something. You learn that your core assumptions were wrong, and that’s okay. But let’s be clear, if you can execute, then when you acquire that new information, you can incorporate it and you can do something with it. If you can’t execute, you might not even learn that you’re doing the wrong thing. And when you learn you’re doing the wrong thing, it’s very hard to switch. So we don’t mind when people pivot. Now let’s be clear. Most YC companies don’t pivot. I think there’s this perception, like, you know, 90 percent of companies are pivoting all the time. And I think pivot is being used in extremely aggressive ways nowadays. It’s kind of the cool term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnGTFQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vox Media has a whole podcast called &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pivot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It’s the hip thing to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8b8FX"&gt;There you go. You know, someone described YC’s model as anti-fragile. We don’t try to be too right. And there’s a very, very small downside if we’re wrong. Which allows us to give founders the benefit of the doubt. And what’s funny is that so many people who are at YC were alums, and I think that we would argue that YC definitely gave us the benefit of the doubt. I mean, Justin.tv started as an online reality TV show where my co-founder, Justin, was wearing a camera on his head and broadcasting his life 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U46oTu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There has been a very long, contentious debate about diversity in tech — in the Valley specifically, but broadly in tech. What you’re describing is a set of questions that, if you read them narrowly, funnel towards one kind of founder. Someone from a technical background who can communicate to another group of founders clearly. Who can devote nights and weekends to getting something built to show that they have started solving their problem, that has a network or a set of relationships with other people devoted to the same problem. You can see how that narrows the funnel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHuDSD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you expand the funnel while keeping the barriers that you’ve described high?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2x9M0"&gt;So, I don’t like describing them as barriers, because it implies that people can’t accomplish them. It’d be a barrier if we only accepted people who were above six foot six tall. I don’t know any way to make yourself taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBhXhm"&gt;So let’s be clear. Can you have experience with the problem you’re solving? Yes. Can you have a relationship with your co-founders before you start the company? Yes. Can you recruit a technical co-founder or learn how to code yourself? Yes. Can you make progress on your product? Yes. So none of these things, I think, are barriers. I think that what I’ve appreciated about this is, people want to know what they have to reach for. Like they know they’re trying to accomplish something that’s almost impossible. Like, it’s just as hard to become an NBA basketball player as a successful startup founder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaS7v7"&gt;They know the challenge is hard. And what they want to be given is accurate information about how to accomplish the challenge. They don’t want to be coddled. And so when I think about my approach to how we increase the number of underrepresented founders in the startup world — I can’t speak to the tech world. I’ve never really worked in a big tech company. Different challenges, I’ve been in the startup world — I’ve always thought about it in four chunks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BtTqrL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Arlan Hamilton is building a new kind of VC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22213270/arlan-hamilton-backstage-capital-vc-venture-capitalist-interview-decoder"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I3s3lQ"&gt;One is information. For the longest time, the information about how to access this world was only distributed vocally. You had to know someone. YC spends a ridiculous amount of time publishing information about the startup world. Everything that I’ve told you so far has been written and recorded in six different places online for free. And I’m doing it here again. Because we don’t believe information should be a barrier to getting access to this world. And to further that, we created a program called Startup School, which is a free online MOOC that hundreds of thousands of startup founders have participated in, that distributes all of the information about how to get started with a startup. So that’s the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MA4AU9"&gt;The second one’s cash. It’s a big deal, the cash. With YC, we not only have to fund companies. But we have to make sure that they raise money on Demo Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBTqc0"&gt;The third one’s advice. Of course, advice on how to run your startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQApdz"&gt;And then the fourth, of course, is community. So YC is kind of structured to try to help outsiders become insiders. And, you know, to be honest, a disproportionate number of underrepresented founders are outsiders. And so I think it’s one of the reasons why I was attracted to YC both as a founder, and to work here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEILKu"&gt;Now in terms of the challenges, one of our YC partners, Dalton Caldwell, he often refers to this idea that a lot of times people look for silver bullets, one silver bullet. When they should be looking for 12 lead bullets. And I’ve been working on how to increase diversity at YC since I joined. And what I’ve realized is that there are so many things to do. And I wish there was a silver bullet, but I haven’t found one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6SjdX"&gt;So in the last six years, YC has funded about 150 Black founders, about over 400 Latinx founders. And close to 600 female founders. And after doing that, I still feel like, one, there’s a ton of work to be done, like an absolute ton of work. And two, every time I think that I’ve figured out a problem, another problem arises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0D38IO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get specific. What are some of these problems? What’s a problem that you’ve solved, that another problem has arisen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFRexs"&gt;I’ll be ridiculously specific. Socio-economic. When I talk to people who have the technical skills, who are interested in software, who are interested in startups, socio-economic barriers are really tricky. So at 23, I’m working at Google. And I am part of the safety net of my extended family — when people need money, they come to me. Do I have the same freedom to do a startup as somebody who grew up, went to the same school, has the same level of education, and same interest, but whose parents were doctors and lawyers? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MJTPP"&gt;I think that we don’t talk about that. I was talking to a woman who was working at Apple as an engineer, and absolutely murdering it. And she was just like, “I have people who depend on me. And I need to make sure that no matter what, my family doesn’t fall down.” Now I think that, you know, parents are used to that responsibility. Almost everyone’s used to that responsibility for their kids. But disproportionately, it’s underrepresented founders who are used to that responsibility for the generation above them, and for the generations to the side of them. How do we solve those problems? You know, part of the solution is making sure that I can tell them, if you get into YC and you do well, I guarantee you, you will be able to raise money. But wow, that’s still risky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="auu1M4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a whole other set of founders who grew up in an upper-middle class...have all the ability and all the skill to build great products. But they don’t even know what to apply that skill to.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVnfNr"&gt;There’s a geographic problem, especially pre-COVID. “My family needs me there physically. I’ve got family members with health issues. I’ve got family members who I’m helping out with child care.” And, you know, historically, YC has deeply encouraged people to move to the Bay Area. Well, that creates a barrier. Now that YC’s remote, that becomes a little bit easier. So it’s like, we can do these tweaks to kind of make things a little bit easier. But you know, what I’ve noticed is that like, man, I can’t solve the general socio-economic disparities in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0EcOV"&gt;And to some extent, I have to help founders overcome those. Where there’s a whole other set of founders who that’s not even their challenge. I think that’s kind of one of the more depressing parts of my job, is that there exists a whole set of founders who have experience with a ton of real-world problems, and have structural socio-economic issues that prevent them from solving them by creating startups. There’s a whole other set of founders who grew up in an upper-middle class, just beautiful setup, almost never experienced any real problems, who have all the ability and all the skill to build great products. But they don’t even know what to apply that skill to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rB4aVt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I talk to those folks a lot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FR33iP"&gt;Me too. It’s frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHMv04"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn’t the solution just more cash? If you want to remove risk from a choice like that, the simplest way to do it is to just throw more cash at that problem. So you’ve got a longer window of opportunity to take the risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbldMI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re great at Apple and you leave for a year, and you can still float your family, you can go back into big tech at the end of that year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrApH"&gt;You know what’s interesting? So that’s what I thought. I thought, look, if you get a job at Facebook, that’s your safety net. You can always get that job at Facebook. So I was talking to some college kids a couple years ago. You know what they told me? They told me that the recruiter told them, if they didn’t take the offer out of school, they would never get an offer again from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLUvEV"&gt;They were like, “Michael, that’s too risky. I should definitely work at Facebook for a couple years just ...” And I’m like, “Oh my God.” So let’s be clear. It’s not like everyone wants these kids to do startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiGhvB"&gt;So one, that’s very, very hard. Two, Apple’s not going anywhere. I can’t tell a founder that if they raise enough money, their startup will succeed. We know that’s false. And I don’t want to lie to a founder. I gotta tell the founder the truth; most startups fail. Almost all startups fail. So the chances of Apple failing, basically nil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bnzQ6"&gt;The chances of your startup succeeding, closer to nil. And like, I don’t want to lie. So it doesn’t matter. Like the typical YC company raises enough money on Demo Day to pay the founders for years, if they didn’t hire a bunch of people. And that’s clearly documented. But it’s still like, “I’m going down a path where probably I’m going to fail.” And I think what’s so interesting about this is that there’s a lot of people who are saying, “Why aren’t underrepresented people doing startups more?” And they’re not recognizing that like, for some people, it’s not the logical choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVtYIL"&gt;These are smart people who should make the choices that are better for their lives and their families. You know, when I started this job, I tried to twist people’s arms to do startups. And these are the stories that I heard, “I’m supporting my mom. I have a family member with health problems.  And I was like, “Fuck. I shouldn’t be guilt tripping someone into doing a startup.” Like that’s, that’s bullshit. Everyone should have their freedom to choose the right choice for them. I should make sure that they understand this choice. I should make sure that this choice is well-documented and they can access it. I have the responsibility to promote success cases and say, “Hey, if you want to do this, we’re here to help.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ryq9XA"&gt;At the end of the day, we have to treat people like they’re intelligent people making the best choices possible for their families and for themselves. We gotta do that. That’s basic respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfsOpC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020 was the heart of the pandemic here in the States. Y Combinator did &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;go fully remote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. The whole program was remote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NisMNB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you going to go back to in-person? Or are you going to keep it fully remote? How’s that going to work for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2h2odV"&gt;I was shocked at how well remote worked. And I was shocked at how it forced YC to get better. And I was shocked at how it made YC more accessible to founders around the world. I was nervous. I went through YC in person twice. And I was nervous. “Could we make something that was as good or better during COVID?” was unclear. And, the silver lining of COVID was it forced us to look at some of the sacred cows of how YC worked and ask, “Why?” It forced us to innovate. And that was a great process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4Sx56"&gt;I think that everyone who runs any kind of organization is being asked some version of this question right now, and the only correct answer is some version of, we want to take what’s best from the in-person program, we want to take what’s best that we’ve learned from the remote program, and use it to make the best product possible, and the most accessible product possible. And that’s not a one-time decision. I think one of the fun things about YC is that between every batch, we survey our founders, and we ask ourselves, “How do we make the damn thing better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MynHOE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a whole bunch of serendipity that happens from having people in the office. People are wandering around, they can see each other’s screens. They can talk in the hallways. Some idea that you were never going to have happens because of serendipity in the office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8hRH4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I look on the flip side. I look at our own staff meeting, which is now in Zoom. And the chat in our staff meeting is rockin’. So the meeting has become more participatory. I have no idea how to re-create that in person. I’ve got this thing that I want, which is serendipity in person. And I’ve got this thing that I have now, because of remote work, which is serendipity in virtual spaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwsVPv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you bridge those things together? What’s the thing that you had before that you want to capture? And what’s a thing that you gained from the remote program that you want to keep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeMlO5"&gt;I’ll give you a perfect example in kind. When we did office hours with founders before COVID, oftentimes they’d have to drive to our office, either in Mountain View or San Francisco. Figure out how to park. Get in through security signing, dah, dah, dah. And inevitably we were running a couple of minutes late, so wait around. Talk for half an hour, and then reverse that whole thing. So to get a half hour of advice, they probably had to invest about two hours. Sometimes longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWBqtK"&gt;In the remote program, half an hour of advice takes half an hour. So YC partners did 50 percent more office hours with companies. But it’s harder to build a personal connection with someone through a screen. Not impossible, but harder. So I think a future YC is going to one, need to put people together enough that they feel like they’re getting that personal connection. But really, really, really needs to preserve the time-saving components of remote, because if every office hour is done in-person, we’re giving a worse product to the founders. So that’s just a single example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SIpZj"&gt;I’ll give you another example. We had events down in Mountain View. The set of speakers that I can bring to Mountain View is entirely different than the set of speakers that I can bring on Zoom. If you want to hear from a speaker that’s halfway around the world, well, they’re not flying to Mountain View for a two-hour talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qv8wt"&gt;If I want to give you the most diverse set of speakers that can help you the best, I gotta do that on Zoom. But there should be events where you can actually see alumni who are further ahead than you and start building a relationship with them in person. So I have to provide that kind of product too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NgW4g"&gt;I think the question we’re going to have to answer in YC is, what parts of it work better in person? What parts of it work better online? And let’s be clear, a lot of people think of YC like school. This, like, 24/7 thing. YC programming historically has been one night a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkq9uF"&gt;One night a week for three months. So most of the time, 95 percent of the time, you are in your apartment working on your startup. You’re not hanging out with us. You’re not in some classroom learning. That’s not YC. And so I want to be careful to make sure people understand, like, from an expectations perspective, it’s not like pre-COVID all the founders were at my house 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyFaQX"&gt;So I think that we’re going to be able to strike that balance. And what’s cool is that we have all these great feedback mechanisms. I still work with founders directly. I still help run a group. All the group partners still run a group. We’re all going through this experience with the founders in addition to serving them and looking at all the data, etc. So I’m confident we’ll make it work. I’m actually excited to make it work. This job’s boring if it doesn’t change. I think running a school that hasn’t changed in 50 years sounds like the most boring thing in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aesr8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think of it as a school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTsoYM"&gt;You know, it’s tricky. I would say that it’s almost how I would want a school to be. I would love a school that was more project-oriented and less classroom-oriented, that was more about working on something that you’re passionate about than working on something that someone told you to work on, but that still gave you a feeling of a community, that still gave you support, that gave you even more support after you graduated from the school than a lot of schools do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KozZ78"&gt;In a weird way, we’re trying to take the best from investors and the best from schools and we’re trying to figure out how to make something great. What’s interesting, I was having this conversation with Geoff Ralston, who’s the president of YC, just yesterday where he said, “I think we’re the only fund where people who raise money from us call themselves alumni.” And I like that. I like that there’s a relationship with the community, not just a relationship with us. The more I think about YC in this context, we’re part of the larger YC community, but we’re not the center of it. You know? We’re just another entity within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Z7haq"&gt;There’s alumni. There’s big companies. There’s small companies. There’s people who go off and work at companies. There’s all this other stuff that’s going on. And we’re just trying to support this community. We’re not trying to dominate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWBmTk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dynamic of money has just really changed in the pandemic. What you are describing is school. It’s a rigor. You’re probably going to fail. You’re going to get an alumni network of people who are going to be as hard on you as your friends from college. Or you could just chase the dumb money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvZRLh"&gt;So here’s the thing, I’m so happy about this stuff. It’s hard for me to look at the speculation that’s going on in crypto, and that’s going on in the stock market or certain parts of the stock market, and say it’s good. It’s hard for me to say that. The silver lining of that activity, though, that is probably positive for the startup community in the long run, is that I think startups were getting too popular. It was starting to attract people who were more interested in the results than in the work. That were more interested in getting rich quick than solving an important problem or giving a shit about their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOh4zG"&gt;And there were all these forces that were kind of telling people, “Oh, it’s super easy. Oh, you can get acqui-hired. Oh, you don’t need to write code, you just use no-code tools.” Like, there are all these tools, these things kind of communicating to people who want to get rich quick that startups was the place to do it. Now with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, with the crypto trading, I’m kind of hoping that that’s a brighter light that’s attracting those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sq4Wr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. That’s like honey-potting people with AMC trades. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8YL2J"&gt;Go there. All you have to do is put some funds on your computer, and you can theoretically make money, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9pko5"&gt;If that sounds appealing to you, I’d rather not work with you. And so go over there. Now, is it good for the economy at large? Like, no. You know, I wish we had a better way of educating the get-rich-quick people that maybe they shouldn’t just be get-rich-quick people. But in the meantime, I’m actually seeing in the startup world, and especially in the international startup community, more mission-driven founders, not less. That’s really appealing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoRjxU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I see often with YC companies in particular is they think they can solve societal problems with a pure application of technology. I’ll just give an example. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I interviewed Chris Best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, who’s the CEO of Substack. Substack’s a YC company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVWN0f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I reflected on that conversation afterwards, I realized I was talking about very specific journalistic problems, and Chris was talking to me about very specific technical solutions. And we might not have been speaking the same language. I just wonder if that tight focus on “we can use technology and technology solutions to solve a range of huge problems,” whether that kind of leaves out an entire category of founder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFKZwO"&gt;The first thing I will say is that in some large part, I think it’s all of our responsibilities to try to solve societal problems. Like, that’s part of being part of our society. That’s part of civic responsibility. And when I look at the entities that do that, it’s government, it’s nonprofits, it’s kind of loosely organized communities, your neighbors, your friends, it’s individuals and it’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkdD2J"&gt;And at the end of the day, all of them are trying to address societal problems in one way or the other. Now, some of those problems might seem trite or not significant. The problem of entertainment is often shat on. Like, oh, people want to be entertained. But, hey, people like entertainment. I don’t think people should be insulted for that. Like, it’s a problem, and there’s a lot of businesses that solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAtOKX"&gt;When I go back to your question, I think business of course is solving societal problems. Does it always do it well? No. Can it do it with just software alone? No. Like of course problems are multifaceted. But I love founders who want to solve societal problems, because to me the opposite of that founder is the founder that just wants to get rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9j5aEx"&gt;If I had to choose between those two, I’d much rather a founder who’s mission-oriented 100 percent. And, like, eventually, anyone who builds a successful product has to become mission-oriented. They have to be consumer-focused. They have to care about their customer, or else in the long run, they’re not going to be building a sustainable business. So sometimes I think that founders get confused into believing that society isn’t their problem, that they’re just in the mode of “get theirs while they can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EamiQe"&gt;They’re kind of shitting on the commons. And I find this more with US founders than international founders. I find US founders really sometimes take the US for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgY6Uq"&gt;There are some international founders who are just like, “I wish I had half of what you have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxeStb"&gt;I love mission-oriented founders. Now, let’s be clear, right, governments can do things with unintended negative consequences. Nonprofits can do that. Communities can do that. Individuals can do that. Businesses can too. All of those entities have to be held to account for what actual impact they’re having. But society has problems, and if you want to build a business to try to solve them and it’s an ethical, fair business, I want to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iM2gMu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You co-founded Justin.tv and turned it into &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/twitch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which is at the forefront of a bunch of creator economy stories. Recently, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21285835/reddit-board-replacement-alexis-ohanian-michael-seibel-y-combinator"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you joined the board of Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;after Alexis Ohanian stepped down and encouraged the company to diversify. So now you sit on the board of one of the most influential user-generated content companies that exists. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJG85f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reddit is like everybody’s homepage all the time. It has a lot of weight in the culture. It has a lot of thorny moderation problems. It has had some weird governance problems in the past. How has your perspective on Reddit changed after you joined the board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwOQNS"&gt;I’m not a spokesperson for Reddit, so I’d rather answer this question more broadly. This is what I would say. The economy in America has always been very friendly to small businesses, and it’s always been part of our culture. And I think one of the things that we’re witnessing is how small business is changing. And for the longest time, small business meant starting a shop or a barber shop or a restaurant, and getting a loan from a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBMeWE"&gt;And it’s obvious that as software takes over the economy, that has to change. And I think what’s interesting is that if you look at that in the creator world, the old-fashioned thing was you have to go through the gatekeepers, the studios, or the agencies and dah, dah, dah, dah. And only a small number of people become really popular and can make money. And I think software’s changing that. I think all of these tech platforms are changing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5dqad"&gt;And I think that what you see in the creator economy is creative people trying to figure out, “How do I build a business online?” just like you would see shop owners of the 21st century saying, “How do I build a shop online?” And so the creators might go to a YouTube or a Twitch or TikTok or wherever. The shop owners of the 21st century would go to a Shopify or something like that. And what’s cool about it is it seems that at least in some areas, it seems to be both increasing the size of the pie and increasing the number of people who participate in the pie. And both of those things are very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBpZlw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a Reddit community forms,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;it’s still inextricably tied to Reddit. If you develop a great Twitch channel and you have a career as a Twitch streamer — we have now seen this — you still can’t leave. Your relationship has become tied to the platforms in a way that the shop owner who got a loan from the bank was not forever necessarily beholden to one chain of banks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ke3pI9"&gt;I disagree. I would say that that shop owner was just as tied in. I don’t think any business can survive on its own. It was tied into the advertising it was doing in the yellow pages. It was tied into the bank that was giving you the line of credit. It was tied into all the different institutions in that community. I think this is the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9rvAd"&gt;I remember when Emmett Shear, the CEO of Twitch, I remember when he came up with the insight for Twitch. And I think everyone thought that the Twitch insight was that people wanted to stream video games or watch video gaming streaming, and that was not the insight at all. The core insight was that video game streamers wanted streaming video games to be their job. They wanted to quit their day job and do this, and Twitch had to figure out how to enable them to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8GSIy"&gt;Before that insight, we were lost as a company. I mean, we did a bunch of stuff. We got a lot of traffic. We grew, our technology grew. As a product, we didn’t have a user and a user’s motivation in mind. And Emmett and Kevin Lin spent months talking to our video game streamers, and they all kept on saying the same thing, “How do I make money so I can quit my job and do this full-time?” And that’s what Twitch did. It gave those people jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKYWJv"&gt;And so it’s weird that you would make the case, “Oh, it’s not giving them a platform that allows them to stream video completely independently of Twitch.” That’s really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcY2zq"&gt;But what it is doing is allowing them to quit their job that they hate and do their job that they love. That’s pretty good. Now, I would argue that, like, in the entertainment industry, that’s still hard because it’s still kind of this thing where most of the viewers want to look at relatively few streamers. It’s still very, very hard to make that dream available to everyone. But when we started, nobody was making money streaming video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TV9DHu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think we’re at a maturation point in the industry. A lot of those assumptions are being questioned. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvgI3N"&gt;I think that’s fair. I think maybe the question I would say is that, as much as I love Twitch, maybe Twitch isn’t inventing what’s next. As much as I use YouTube, maybe YouTube’s not inventing. Like maybe that’s what the next startup needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8bStj"&gt;Like before we started Twitch, you couldn’t put live video online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ompr90"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you think about why YC startup classes, who you’re funding their businesses, it seems like creator economy-focused businesses are going to run into the restrictions that the platforms place on these products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYez9v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So last week, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we talked to Horacio Gutiérrez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; from Spotify. I asked, “Why don’t you have a button that just lets me pay an artist on Spotify and your whole problem with musicians goes away?” And he stammered, and he couldn’t really answer.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And the answer was, because they would have to pay Apple 30 percent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfyCAx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got Reddit. It seems like I should just be able to pay my favorite Redditors for the best jokes on Reddit. I’m sure Reddit doesn’t want to pay Apple 30 percent. Do you think that platform tax is a barrier to innovation as you think about the startups that YC is investing in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orjUNm"&gt;Here’s my entirely unsatisfactory answer. It both enables and is a barrier. In order for these companies to be successful, they had to enable some amount of new activity. They have to build a new part of the economy. Of course they want to own as much of it as possible. And so from an ecosystem question, I feel like the question you’re asking me is, “Should founders be trying to disrupt the big companies of today?” Yes. Disrupt away. Go nuts, because one of two things will happen. Either you’ll win and your users will get more value than they’re getting today, or in the effort of pushing these companies, the companies will have to improve and get better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAXL6i"&gt;Like Slack forced Microsoft to get better. And either way, users get served a better product. So, I, as a startup investor, can’t be protectionist. Kill everyone. Like, go nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8oDGc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But at the same time, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150313/how-microsoft-crushed-slack-salesforce-acquisition"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft forced Slack to get eaten&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQwoWM"&gt;I’ve talked about this with a lot of people. I don’t think big companies competing hard is a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYuI5k"&gt;I personally believe Slack was in a great position, but it is very, very hard to build another Microsoft. Not because Microsoft’s there, although that’s a factor, but just building a Microsoft is hard, even if there were no Microsofts. And this is a hidden thing that I think people don’t talk about a lot. Not only is it hard from an execution perspective, but think about it from a founder’s perspective. You don’t have to build the next Microsoft in order to make a life-changing amount of money. So, your motivation has to be far beyond serving your customers, because your product’s available, you can serve customers. It has to be far beyond making a life-changing amount of money. There’s gotta be something else intrinsically driving you to make something as big as a Microsoft or as a Google or as an Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uafDO"&gt;And I think we don’t talk about that enough. I don’t think we talk about enough what it takes to make something that big because there are all of these economic successes. Investors and founders can make money at success levels that are way below “you made the next trillion-dollar company”. But hey, if you want to have a massive impact as a founder, that’s where you have to be aiming. And so do I believe that Slack had the potential to be a Microsoft? To be a top player? Yes. We’re using Zoom right now. Do I think Zoom has the potential to be a top player? Yes. It’s gotta get lucky, it’s gotta execute really well, but I think the potential is there for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncnHn6"&gt;But let’s be clear. All the big players are going to be fighting against them. They’re all going to be fighting back. So they’re going to have to build a better product. But in this day and age, especially with software, I feel like loyalty is going down and down and down. People want to use the product that works the best. Google has had live-streaming for how many years? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHQZ5X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A software founder who’s mission-oriented, who sees a big opportunity, they chase it and chase it and chase it, they build a software product they can scale without them, so they could get sick and take a day off, and the database in AWS is going to keep serving their product to people and they’re still getting paid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLUnPv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You take a streamer on Twitch or a YouTuber or an Instagram influencer or whoever, they’re fundamentally unscalable, so they might be still mission-driven, they might still work just as hard. But if they take a day off, they make less money. But the platforms that enable them will still collect that money. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKMik9"&gt;Let’s put this up into two different things, right. So, you are a restaurant owner, and yes, if your restaurant is not operating on Sundays, you don’t make money on Sundays, of course, right. The power company who delivers power to your business is always open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ta004"&gt;It’s always open. Twitch is always open. Reddit is always open. The platforms are always open. So, it’s a different kind of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="momAXj"&gt;We don’t go to the power company and say, “It’s fundamentally unfair that you make money when I’m at work and at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5ALxi"&gt;We say, “Thanks for the lights,” and “Don’t charge me too much money, and “Hey, if my power’s not working, screw you. I’m going to go somewhere else.” A different kind of business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3xcxS"&gt;If creators don’t want to be in the creator economy, don’t be in it. Right? That’s fine. And like if creators want to be in it, but they want it to be better, agitate, complain, build something new, right. I’m not saying you should deny the desire for something better. You should be vocal about it. But I can’t change the fundamental nature of that kind of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61Ry4r"&gt;I can’t change the fact that your viewers will leave you if you’re not providing them enough content, because in a weird way, if you take a company like Twitch, they’re building a product, a tool for streamers to give something their viewers want. And I can’t control what your viewers want. Emmett [Shear, CEO of Twitch] can’t control what your viewers want. Like, we are all the viewers, and if we want something, we will reward the person who gives it in the content world with more views and allow them to make more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpYhZt"&gt;And so to me, that’s the economy we’re in. It doesn’t help us to shit on the platform that’s enabling that economy. Critique is great. I love critique. But let’s just acknowledge it’s created jobs that didn’t exist before. It created opportunities that didn’t exist before. There are more entertainers in the world now than there were 25 years ago. There are more people who could pay their rent creating content today than there were 25 years ago, and these platforms are the ones that enabled that. That’s pretty good, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JntQR8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is. I just think maybe we’re past the point where you can pay down the new problems with the old credit, you know what I mean? The platforms are really big.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siHxX3"&gt;I would agree with that 100 percent. I would agree that a platform has to earn your loyalty every single year, and if it screws you long enough, it will get disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5O88C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see a wave of applicants to YC that are aiming to disrupt Google Search or YouTube or Instagram? That to me is one of the most confounding mysteries. The end of every YouTuber’s lifecycle is the video they make where they say how mad they are at YouTube, and they have nowhere to go. And I’m mystified at why there’s not a crop of startups aiming to take those creators and that revenue and that audience away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nim81"&gt;You know what’s interesting? It’s not obvious to me that the thing that disrupts one of these platforms even looks like it. So like we funded OpenSea, right, and they’re enabling these NFTs. And hey, maybe there’s a chance that NFTs are a tool, then, creators can use to monetize. And if that’s the case, then in a weird way, the creator will be less tied to the platform of sending them checks. And so, disruption doesn’t always look absolutely straightforward. And I don’t know what disruption’s going to look like, you know? TikTok doesn’t look like YouTube at all. It is very, very different, and in ways that people would argue are bad. If you were to pitch TikTok to someone when YouTube was dominant and TikTok was started, they’d be like, “So you don’t get to browse what you want? You can’t search for what you want?” People would tell you it was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vELQt4"&gt;I don’t know what the killers of these platforms will do. And it could be a direct disrupter and it could be something that just renders them slightly less influential every year until they become kind of like MySpace one day. We’ll see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ayQqe"&gt;Our feeling of apprehension that innovation isn’t happening enough, unfortunately, I think one of the biggest things — especially in the consumer world that that’s tied to — is that the platforms haven’t changed. So like, you and I came up during a time where the internet happened,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5DFBl"&gt;Web apps happened. Laptops happened. Mobile phones happened. Each of those changes enables a whole set of new companies to compete with the old ones, but since iPhone, have we seen one yet? Most of our young career, we saw these things happening all the time, but at least me, I’m 38, most of my middle career, I haven’t seen one happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7atD5d"&gt;And if you’re trying to compete with these platforms on their home field, it’s way harder than if VR were to happen, or something else were to happen, and you compete with them in an area where you can be better than them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz56EI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see the action in the creator economy, and what it feels like to me is a lot of being on someone else’s turf, even if that turf enabled your business to exist. But what I don’t see yet is the classic founder story. Here’s a creator who was frustrated with YouTube and went off and started something that was better than YouTube that solved his problems or her problems better. And that seems very, very hard to me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVAhWC"&gt;Here’s an analogy that might apply here. I feel like what you’re asking me is why is it hard to go from creating a family restaurant to creating McDonald’s. And I would argue that like in some fundamental way, even though they’re both restaurants, they’re not really the same thing. And so, you actually have to fundamentally change what you want to do in order to build a McDonald’s. And there are sacrifices to that. I think a lot of people who are running family businesses would say, “I will never want to be a McDonald’s franchise owner, let alone inventor of the next McDonald’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svc6nV"&gt;I think that that’s a fundamentally different business. If you want to have the power, influence, and money of a platform creator, then probably you’re going to have to switch from being a content creator to a platform creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8MmQ4"&gt;It’s really hard to stay a content creator and have the money, power, and influence of a platform creator. It’s really hard. They’re different businesses with different ceilings. In the gaming world, we saw this a little bit with esports, where people kind of went from being gamers to being organizers of teams and then organizers of tournaments.  I think that you see it with influencers, like Mr. Beast, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/dining/ghost-kitchen-mrbeast-burger.html"&gt;starting food brands&lt;/a&gt;. You’re starting to see these people realize that they’re not content creators. They’re entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dw1aCp"&gt;And entrepreneurs can create all different kinds of businesses. And so that’s another angle, right. Like as more and more of your money doesn’t come from the platform because you’re the entrepreneur and you use your audience to build other businesses, your allegiance goes away from that platform. And it’s funny because if you look at this in the sports arena, in basketball, right, you can make more money off the shoe deal than you make off of your contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S86KTV"&gt;That leverage counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ54mh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is next for Y Combinator? What does it look like in the next year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xywV0Y"&gt;Next is going to be figuring out YC in the post-COVID world, which I think is going to be a lot of fun. And I think next is going to be more international. I think investors have pivoted impressively to being able to fund companies over Zoom, which to me means that the startup communities around the world are going to get more and more and more funding, and problems around the world are going to be addressed by more companies. I think it’s going to be great. A hundred years from now, we’re going to look back at this moment and say, “This moment was birthing five, 10, 15, 20 global startup communities.” Which would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-06-08T09:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <title>Amazon’s new Echo Show 8 is a little faster and has a better camera</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Still the best Alexa smart display&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dU5SU5"&gt;Amazon’s midsize Echo Show 8 is the best smart display in its lineup. It is larger and more capable than the diminutive Echo Show 5, while costing far less than the larger Echo Show 10. The Echo Show 8 is handy for watching video, listening to music, getting weather reports, controlling smart home devices, making video calls, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFaRLc"&gt;So it’s no surprise that the second-generation model, which sells for $129.99 and is shipping this week, doesn’t rock the boat. It’s largely the same smart display as before but with slightly faster performance and an improved video calling camera. It has the same display, same design, same speaker system, and the same set of features as its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4AwORI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10594276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9foDKT"&gt;Improving the video calling capabilities makes sense, given how much video calling has been done while everyone was (and for large part, still is) stuck at home during the pandemic. The new Echo Show 8 borrows the 13-megapixel camera from the flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the pathetically low-resolution, mediocre 1-megapixel camera that was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;first gen&lt;/a&gt;. As before, there’s a mechanical privacy shutter you can slide in front of the camera to both disable it and block its view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GFPuIrlwrWFjeuL59lsgPIMdw0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641651/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 8 has the same camera as the Echo Show 10: a large, 13-megapixel sensor with automatic panning and cropping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xDKysBbp17RbY5_VoMsDnFGbhFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641652/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still block the camera’s view with a physical shutter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f0w6AJ"&gt;The improvements in video calls are immediately noticeable. You can use the Echo Show  for video calls to the Alexa app on phones or other Echo Show devices, or you can join Skype, Zoom, or Amazon’s Chime calls from it. In my testing with Zoom calls, the image is much sharper and more pleasant to look at, with better color and much more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBf38a"&gt;The Echo Show 8 doesn’t have the motorized base on the bigger Echo Show 10, but it still can automatically frame you and follow you around as you move thanks to its high resolution. The autoframing isn’t as good as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;new iPad Pro’s Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; feature, and it moves much slower and tends to constantly reframe itself, like you’re the star of a Ken Burns documentary. But the Echo Show is a $130 smart display, not an $800 tablet, so it’s hard to complain, so long as you stay relatively still during video calls. If you don’t want the camera to autoframe, you can say “Alexa follow off” to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhFFL-zRIKWvAcviDEhC60cM2Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641650/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Echo Show 8 for Zoom calls, but it works best for one-on-one calling, not groups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rz4Ew"&gt;That said, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. The new camera has a much wider-angle lens, which allows it to do those auto-framing tricks. But it can also cause the image to look distorted at times and isn’t always very flattering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfgMMN"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s eight-inch display works fine for one-on-one video calls, but it’s too small to comfortably use for a group call. If you are on a call where someone is sharing a screen, it’s hard to see what’s happening, and while you can view messages posted to a chat, you can’t type any out yourself on the Echo Show’s display. Joining Zoom calls can be done entirely by voice, but it’s much easier to call up the Zoom app on the Echo Show by saying “Alexa, open Zoom” and then typing in a meeting code or starting one yourself from the touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKlC5v"&gt;I also observed an echo of my own voice in several Zoom calls, both with individuals and group calls, which made it hard to use the Echo Show for anything work related. Other parties on the line also said there was an annoying echo of my voice whenever I unmuted my mic. Amazon says it is looking into this problem and I will update this review if a solution is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aC0UQ6"&gt;The new processor in the second-gen Echo Show 8 does make the smart display respond quicker to taps and swipes than its predecessor. It’s not a huge difference, and Amazon’s software still has a long way to go to make it more useful via touch, but when compared side by side, the new one opens menus and screens quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1mSQJrmHJidSIt94JnUkKT_arM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641646/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wedge-shaped design houses two speaker drivers that put out impressive volume for its size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jrpnisdCEE4OSmDMq8WggNLXg74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641644/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon ditched the 3.5mm output jack on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DQ08q"&gt;Elsewhere, the changes are either nonexistent or very minor. The wedge-shaped design is exactly the same; you can still get it in the same white or black color options as before. (Annoyingly, both colors come with a white power cord.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWd2k2"&gt;The display has the same 1280 x 800 pixel resolution, but now it can adjust its color and white balance to the lighting in the room. Like the new processor, the difference isn’t huge, but the new model is slightly warmer and more pleasant to look at when the adaptive color setting is enabled. I’m still more impressed by the ability of Google’s Nest Hub to mimic the look of a printed photo by adapting its color to the lighting in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aOILp"&gt;The dual-driver speaker system is unchanged and it’s as loud and full sounding as the first gen. The Echo Show 8 can fill a small room with sound surprisingly well, and its bass response is better than expected. At times, it might even sound &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bassy, but you can adjust the EQ in the Alexa app easily enough to compensate for that. Unfortunately, Amazon dropped the 3.5mm output jack on the back of the new model, so it’s not possible to hook it up to a larger speaker system with a wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JFRm2"&gt;You can watch Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix on the Echo Show, but Disney Plus, Peacock, HBO Max, and many other streaming services aren’t available. YouTube is available through the Echo Show’s Silk browser, but it’s not as seamless of an experience as available on Google’s Nest Hub, and you can’t easily cast videos from your phone to the Show’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M6IUZ"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s software is the same as what debuted on the Echo Show 10 earlier this year. Amazon is starting to make better use of the display, with split screens that show weather data alongside news, but it still feels very much like a voice-first device. Though the new Echo Show 8 is faster, it’s still a chore to tap through all of the screens to get to the smart home controls, and managing what shows up in the rotating information screens on the display requires a lot of menu diving and trial and error to get what you want. (And even then, you’ll still probably get nagged about new Alexa Skills or other Amazon promotions you don’t care about.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jt6A-bmN6YU57lqXDW6lw4AYY3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641647/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Managing what shows up on the displays when it’s not being used is a chore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFdANYL11-bM-MdfsbZdGMJXxwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641648/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Show 8 is noticeably faster when responding to touch input.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlERf4"&gt;There are of course many, many other things you can do with an Echo Show smart display — far too many to cover in the scope of this review. The things that I find it most useful for are weather reports, managing a grocery shopping list, and viewing the video feed from a doorbell or security camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKiehW"&gt;The Echo Show 8’s main competition is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub from Google&lt;/a&gt;, which has a slightly smaller seven-inch screen and costs $30 less. The Nest Hub supports more video streaming services, has a more useful touch interface, can track your sleep, and works with the Google Assistant instead of Alexa. But it doesn’t have a camera for video calling, its single speaker is blown away by the Echo Show’s dual speakers, and it’s much slower and laggy to use. Ultimately, the choice comes down to how you want to use the smart display and which smart assistant you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJRYq7"&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt;10-inch Portal&lt;/a&gt; is another option if you plan to use a smart display primarily for video calling, but it loses to the Echo Show 8 in effectively every other aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyrdjP"&gt;If you do prefer Alexa, the new Echo Show 8 remains the best smart display to get, as it has a big enough screen to read from across the room, doubles as a great speaker, and comes with a host of camera-related features, including the aforementioned video calling and security camera features. It’s also over $100 less than the motorized Echo Show 10, while still providing many of the same features and capabilities. And given Amazon’s frequent discounts, you’ll likely be able to find the new Echo Show 8 for less than its sticker price quite often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SCxH88"&gt;The new Echo Show 8 doesn’t redefine what a smart display can be, but it’s still a very good virtual assistant with a screen for an attractive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pyT1af"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8966487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Adobe launches M1 Mac-native versions of Lightroom Classic and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUrVDRbVCUDFepG0rFJ0uaVWlkE=/0x0:5616x3744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421825/akramer_201113_4290_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P51G2C"&gt;Adobe is now shipping new versions of more Creative Cloud apps that run natively on Apple silicon Macs. Lightroom Classic, Illustrator, and InDesign have all been updated for the M1 processor, and Adobe says that you can expect average performance boosts of up to 80 percent across the suite when compared to an equivalent Intel-based Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubNEKM"&gt;Adobe released an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323016/adobe-photoshop-apple-silicon-m1-now-available"&gt;M1-native version of Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; back in March, while an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162930/adobe-lightroom-arm64-windows-macos-m1"&gt;update for Lightroom&lt;/a&gt; came in December. Many photographers (like me) still prefer to use Lightroom Classic, however, which Adobe maintains as a separate app within the Creative Cloud suite, so it’s good to see it get a performance boost to match the newer version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6eKVe8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple MacBook Pro with M1 review: flexing Arm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="m3ocnD"&gt;Based on the results of a third-party benchmarking report commissioned by the company, Adobe says “most operations in Lightroom Classic on an M1 Mac,” including launching, importing, and exporting will be “about twice as fast” as they were on an equivalent Intel Mac. A new Super Resolution image-enhancing feature that’s also been added in this update is “more than three times as fast,” meanwhile. The benchmarks were run on 13-inch MacBook Pro laptops, one with an M1 processor and the other with an Intel Core i5. Both laptops had 16GB of RAM and were hooked up to an Apple Pro Display XDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8l1h9z"&gt;Other Lightroom updates include the ability to specify custom aspect ratios when cropping (as opposed to using the freehand tool) and a set of new premium presets created by pro photographers. The collection includes options for styles like “cinematic” and “futuristic,” as well as portrait presets for various skin tones. They’ll be available in both Lightroom and Lightroom Classic on all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hjXvpD3Wka_uxHblUCGjZnstu4=/219x0:2472x1502/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421548/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.07.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9iIM9X"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;best moment&lt;/a&gt; of this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC keynote&lt;/a&gt; was a straightforward demo of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS feature&lt;/a&gt;, Universal Control. The idea is simple enough: it allows you to use the keyboard and trackpad on a Mac to directly control an iPad, and even makes it simple to drag and drop content between those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwaDPf"&gt;What made the demo so impressive is how easy and seamless it all seemed. In a classic Apple move, there was no setup required at all. The segment happened so fast that it even seemed (incorrectly, as it turns out) like the Mac was able to physically locate the iPad in space so it knew where to put the mouse pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZO9np"&gt;After Zaprudering the clip and asking Apple a few questions, I now have a better understanding of what’s going on here. It turns out that the entire system is actually simpler than it first appears. It’s essentially a new way to use a bunch of technologies Apple had already developed. That’s not a knock on Universal Control — sometimes the best software features are a result of clever thinking instead of brute force technological improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRbIal"&gt;So here’s what’s happening in that demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtq4BY"&gt;First, you need to get the iPad and Mac relatively close to each other. Universal Control is built off the same Continuity and Handoff features that have long been a part of iOS and macOS. When the devices are close enough, their Bluetooth modules let each other know. Of course, all the devices here need to be on the same iCloud account for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTh0Dr"&gt;Then, you start up Universal Control by dragging your mouse pointer all the way to the left or right edge of your Mac’s screen, then a little bit &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; that edge. When you do, the Mac will assume that you’re trying to drag the mouse over to another device, in this case the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2i0wSI"&gt;So there’s no UWB location detection, just good old assumption. One note is that if you have lots of compatible devices, Monterey assumes that you’re dragging towards the last iPad or Mac you interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cAKru"&gt;At this point, a Wi-Fi Direct connection is made and the iPad will show a small bar on the side with a little bump. It’s a sort of indicator that the iPad is aware you’re trying to drag a mouse into it. Keep dragging and pow, the bump breaks free into a circular mouse pointer. When the mouse is on the iPad screen, both it and the keyboard on your Mac control the iPad. Move it back to the Mac, and you control the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zsXlTvQVI3QlVlJyuvC0euUGN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644352/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_7.37.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FzsBpE"&gt;But there’s a clever little affordance built into that strange bar. There are a couple of arrows inside it, a hint that you can slide that bump up or down before it breaks free into the iPad itself. Doing that is how you line up the iPad’s screen with your Mac’s, so that dragging the mouse between the screens doesn’t result in a weird jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPMi9i"&gt;You go through the same process to set up a second device with Universal Control — it maxes out at three. If all this automatic setup sounds like a hassle, you can just go into system preferences and set a device as your preferred Universal Control buddy gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wedQp1"&gt;However you set it up, you can drag and drop content between devices and it’ll use either Wi-Fi Direct or USB to transfer the files. Of course, if you’re dragging files into the iPad, make sure you have an app open (like Files) that can accept it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ydbY"&gt;That’s pretty much the long and the short of it. There are still some details to hash out, Apple tells me, and it isn’t available in the first developer preview. If you put your dock on the left or right edge of the screen, for example, it’s unclear if this whole setup will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yv8GjH"&gt;What’s fascinating to me about this system — as I discuss in the video above — is that it’s only really possible because of a long series of software enhancements that have been built into the iPad over the years, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="ltFF7z"&gt;Continuity, Handoff, and AirDrop. Universal Control isn’t technically AirDrop, but it’s the same basic idea. All of these are the basic ways that Apple devices communicate directly with each other instead of through the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jaBZCN"&gt;Multitasking. I’m not referring to split-screen, but the support for drag-and-drop that came along with the improved windowing options on the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j4pJPz"&gt;Keyboard and mouse support. That’s an obvious pre-requisite, but it wasn’t always obvious that Apple would put mouse support into the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sM5K02"&gt;Sidecar. Sidecar’s the tool that lets you use an iPad as a second Mac monitor. I don’t think that Universal Control uses the same bits of software as Sidecar, but I do think that there were probably lessons there about latency that would prove useful here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="HCXPrd"&gt;I had a hunch that there would be a similar story of evolution on the Mac side of this story. I figured that all the iPad and iOS technologies finding their way into the Mac with the last few releases played a part. Catalyst apps turned into native iPad apps for M1 Macs. Control Center, Shortcuts, and Focus mode all are iOS things that are also on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLzZpF"&gt;Nice idea, but wrong. Apple tells me that the foundation on the Mac side is as simple as it seems, based on Continuity and Handoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0BQA8"&gt;I hope that Universal Control works as well in the real world as it did in this staged demo — and I know that’s no sure thing. But what I like about the feature is how it’s just a clever recombination of existing technologies that Apple had already built for other purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxJMO0"&gt;Inside the Apple ecosystem, you expect that the trade you’re making for only using Apple devices is getting synergistic integrations like this. They’ve actually been rarer than I would have guessed the past few years. But as the Mac and the iPad start trading more and more features with each other, I expect we’ll see more of them going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huge web outage takes Reddit, Twitch, and other big sites offline for an hour</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="YouTube stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AH5PXLgsruINBp_Hgt5NY054xts=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421210/stock-youtube-0195.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LqcEyK"&gt;A huge global web outage swept across the internet this morning, taking out popular sites including Amazon, Twitch, and Reddit. The outages started at around 5:30AM ET, with a large number of sites affected. The Fastly content delivery network (CDN) was the source of the issues, which lasted for more than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srC8qO"&gt;Major news sites like &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;were also affected. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was also down for more than an hour, forcing us to head into Google Docs to share the outage news with readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s7cdX3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Vast chunks of the internet are offline, including The Verge. Until we’re back, we’re reporting to you live out of Google Docs. Here’s what we know so far about the outage: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4b1p2qhYif"&gt;https://t.co/4b1p2qhYif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Verge (@verge) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1402210406328942592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd4yBK"&gt;The issues also affected UK government websites, so British citizens were unable to renew passports, apply for tax allowances, or obtain driving licenses during the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olHi1e"&gt;Fastly hasn’t commented fully on the issues other than an &lt;a href="https://status.fastly.com/incidents/vpk0ssybt3bj"&gt;outage message&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s status page. “The issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented,” said Fastly at 6:44AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waabi, the rare autonomous vehicle startup with a woman CEO, raises $83.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pbUwV7lXsEst19_IfaLC5R8eYpk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421107/Raquel_Urtasun_Portrait_horizontal_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxJwSW"&gt;Waabi is a new autonomous vehicle startup with a few things going for it to help it rise above the fray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9YRdl"&gt;For one, it’s founded by Raquel Urtasun, a renowned expert in computer vision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/8/15578606/uber-ai-labs-self-driving-car-research-toronto"&gt;who ran Uber Advanced Technology Group’s Toronto outpost&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the few women-led AV startups in the world. Second, the Toronto-based company just came out of stealth having raised $83.5 million, which is among the largest Series A rounds ever raised in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTUYpw"&gt;The round was led by Khosla Ventures, with additional participation from Urtasun’s former employer, Uber, and Aurora, the AV startup that ended up acquiring Uber ATG in a deal last year. Funding was also raised from 8VC, Radical Ventures, Omers Ventures, BDC, AI luminaries Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li, Pieter Abbeel, Sanja Fidler, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHh6JG"&gt;That’s a pretty auspicious start for a company that’s jumping into a very crowded space with dozens of startups trying to solve what is arguably the world’s hardest problem: how to make cars and trucks drive themselves safely, reliably, and efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7xamU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waabi’s approach will be to focus on trucking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6IqdH"&gt;Waabi’s approach will be to focus on trucking, using its proprietary software to automate driving on commercial delivery routes. And with its innovative approach to simulation and machine learning, Waabi says it’s poised to commercialize its technology faster and cheaper than most of the AV startups working today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nG43Hh"&gt;Urtasun says her expertise in artificial intelligence, which she has been working on for over 20 years, also gives Waabi a distinct advantage. “I’ve seen really what works, what doesn’t work for AI and technology deployed in a commercial software stack,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VoD1w"&gt;There are two reasons Waabi is setting its sights on trucks as opposed to robotaxis or last-mile delivery vehicles. One is the “incredible” shortage of truck drivers, which Urtasun said could be rectified by the rapid deployment of fully autonomous big-rigs. The second is that highways are “simpler” than complex city streets for autonomous vehicles to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHg0Fz"&gt;There are fears in the trucking industry that autonomous technology will lead to enormous displacement among truck drivers. &lt;a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/managing-transition-driverless-road-freight-transport"&gt;A 2017 study&lt;/a&gt; found that automated trucks could reduce the demand for drivers by as much as 50 to 70 percent in the US and Europe by 2030, with 4.4 million of the 6.4 million professional drivers on both continents rendered obsolete. These fears are heightened as tech companies introduce eye-catching, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923232/einride-tpod-self-driving-truck-sweden-logan"&gt;cabin-less prototypes&lt;/a&gt; designed to cut the driver completely out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXpVaA"&gt;Nonetheless, there’s been a mini-boom in the number of startups racing to be the first to deploy autonomous tractor-trailers. This includes well-financed companies like Waymo, TuSimple, and Aurora; OEMs like Volvo and Daimler; and a host of smaller startups like Ike (which was recently acquired by Nuro), Embark, and Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT459H"&gt;Waabi’s approach will be more “AI centric” than its competitors, Urtasun says. That means a sophisticated “closed loop” simulation program that reduces the need to accrue millions of miles of testing on public roads and highways. Waabi plans on buying several trucks to test its software, but Urtasun said it won’t need more than a handful of vehicles, thanks to its innovative approach to simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2n4JRw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can train an entire system to learn in simulation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u6WsNB"&gt;“So for us in simulation, we can test the entire system,” Urtasun said. “We can train an entire system to learn in simulation, and we can produce the simulations with an incredible level of fidelity, such that we can really correlate what happens in simulation with what is happening in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfTUxk"&gt;Urtasun and her team are also developing a new algorithm that will serve as the foundation for the “brain” of the self-driving car, which helps with motion planning and predicting what other vehicles on the road will do so the AV can react accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZ4il9"&gt;“You end up with a much better scaling technology,” she added, “that you can develop much faster and much cheaper than any of the solutions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2lm8o"&gt;Urtasun started working at Uber in 2017, when the ride-hailing giant brought her on to serve as chief scientist and head of research and development in Toronto. Over the years, her team grew from a small group of eight graduate students to eventually around 50 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYtqVY"&gt;In Toronto, Urtasun was largely insulated from the chaos that was quickly enveloping Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco. The company’s CEO and co-founder, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15844836/uber-ceo-resigns-travis-kalanick"&gt;Travis Kalanick, was ousted a little more than a month&lt;/a&gt; after Urtasun’s appointment was announced. And a year later, a self-driving Uber vehicle with a safety operator behind the wheel struck and killed a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPk8im"&gt;An investigation into the crash faulted Uber for its lack of a robust culture of safety at its autonomous vehicle division. And late last year, Uber finally called it quits, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;off-loading its beleaguered Advanced Technology Group to Aurora&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to reduce costs and signal to investors that it had a real path to profitability. Aurora sent offer letters to about 75 percent of Uber ATG employees, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/the-station-zooxs-six-year-ride-aurora-makes-its-uber-atg-employee-picks-and-nhtsa-takes-a-new-position-on-avs/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but that did not include Urtasun’s team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q0MR0j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is also one of the reasons why we were doing a lot of our development in simulation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zRkaFe"&gt;There was surprise among AV sources that Aurora didn’t extend an offer to Urtasun. Today’s news helps explain why. Urtasun said her experience at Uber, including the fatal crash in Tempe, “really imprinted the importance of safety and having safety first” at Waabi. “This is also one of the reasons why we were doing a lot of our development in simulation,” she added, “to reduce also the risk of developing this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDWOSD"&gt;“Raquel is truly one-of-a-kind — a tenacious and inspiring leader who empowers those around her to excel,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a statement. “I can’t wait to see everything she accomplishes for the self-driving industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG48xS"&gt;In addition to her work at Uber, Urtasun is also a University of Toronto professor and the Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision as well as the co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nO4wdc"&gt;Urtasun said she chose the name “Waabi” because it had a couple of relevant meanings. Among Canada’s First Nations tribes, it means “she has vision,” while in Japanese, it translates as “simple.” The first speaks to Urtasun’s expertise in computer vision and artificial intelligence, while the latter to her company’s intent to simplify the technology that powers self-driving vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEIm3i"&gt;It is rare for an autonomous vehicle startup to have a woman founder and CEO, but Urtasun says she hopes to inspire other women to join the industry. “This is a field that is very dominated by white dudes,” she said. “The way to build integrating knowledge is to build technology with diverse perspectives, because by challenging each other, we build better things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9z6nx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite season 7 has Superman, flying saucers, and a virtual influencer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojC7X_s7XpI1ueXariLWb_fuzWs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420981/Season_7_Key_Art_No_Text.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GfuEdm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465577/fortnite-epic-games-ufos-aliens-abducted-teaser-season-7"&gt;As expected&lt;/a&gt;, aliens have invaded &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s battle royale island. The game’s latest season — &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-2-season-7"&gt;Chapter 2: Season 7&lt;/a&gt; — is called “Invasion,” and it’s just kicked off with a sci-fi vibe that’s a big change from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;last season’s prehistoric theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gkYPD"&gt;Among the changes are flying saucers that players can hack and then pilot, weapons like a rail gun that can shoot through structures and a scanning device, along with a crafting material called nuts and bolts that lets players make classic weapons that were previously removed from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EpXtwj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-NycdXYBeG4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gvqobW"&gt;As always, the big draw of the new season is the battle pass, which introduces a number of characters to the game for those who purchase it. For season 7 that means Superman (who will be available to unlock later in the season), a customizable alien named Kymera, a human / alien double agent called Joey, and a hulking battle droid. Perhaps the strangest addition is Guggimon, a virtual influencer with more than 1 million followers on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/guggimon/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOPIhn"&gt;For those playing on PC, the new season will also include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465735/fortnite-pc-graphics-season-7"&gt;a number of visual improvements putting the game on par with next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
