    <title>Oculus is rolling out its new and more expressive avatars starting today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_voS2YkWbsEA3J8XjvuazuATz4=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175846/Avatar_Animation.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4v1Prd"&gt;Oculus is beginning to roll out redesigned avatars that are more expressive and customizable than those that launched in 2016. They’ll appear starting today in just a few games for the Quest VR platform, including &lt;em&gt;Epic Roller Coasters&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PokerStarsVR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt&lt;/em&gt;. Soon, they’ll appear in &lt;em&gt;Synth Riders&lt;/em&gt;, and later in the year, a new game called ForeVR Bowling will feature them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpLsuS"&gt;The avatars launching today, starting with those few select games, seem far more fleshed out. They’ll have legs, for one. The new avatar editor apparently allows for a quintillion possible combinations of hair, eyes, body type, facial hair, piercings, clothing, and other features. There’s no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13195664/oculus-avatars-non-gendered-virtual-reality"&gt;gender toggle&lt;/a&gt;, nor are there a pre-baked batch of face presets. Instead, the editor lets you dive into each facial feature, down to wrinkles, nose, and makeup. It’s like a glorified character creator from an RPG. You can make an avatar that looks similar to you or just one that’s aspirational, reflecting how you want to be seen in social VR spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus avatar editor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LZTDkcqaWjsXxd42Clc3vkD4IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464870/oculusavatarsnew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Oculus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the new avatar editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N7d2kt"&gt;By the end of 2021, Oculus will have opened its new avatar SDK to all developers, and these VR personas will be supported in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Ffacebook-horizon%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Horizon&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s own expansive social VR playground. Though, games are just one application for these refreshed avatars. Oculus says the avatar you create will eventually appear in some form within the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, and more, but only if you choose to. Oculus wouldn’t divulge any specifics on how exactly your avatar will appear in those apps or when. “We’re at the start of a long journey,” Mike Howard, product manager for avatars at Oculus, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuU8v5"&gt;Avatars first launched on the Oculus Rift platform in 2016 as “monochrome busts with floating hands,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13191240/oculus-connect-3-rift-virtual-reality-avatars-hands-on-video"&gt;as my colleague Adi Robertson put it&lt;/a&gt;. Howard shared that all of the avatars from the early days had eyewear on because they weren’t trying to simulate realistic facial features, particularly the eyes. Hand movement was the big breakthrough at the time, since Oculus had launched its Touch controllers for the Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTpuhm8KinoqN9aFE04NkWez9B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464901/ProPutt_2_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Avatars in &lt;/em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KGb4Fm"&gt;The design of these new avatars builds off the learnings from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17189516/facebook-spaces-vr-avatar-customization-options-oculus-rift"&gt;now-defunct Facebook Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and the aforementioned Horizon experience that’s currently in an invite-only beta — both of which opted for a more welcoming, cartoon-y look than the more realistic Expressive Avatars that Oculus showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17906514/oculus-vr-rift-expressive-avatars-eye-mouth-tracking-home-customization"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Howard told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that these new avatars are oriented in their design toward delight with attributes from animation techniques. The expressions look a little exaggerated, and they’re about as harmless-looking as Memoji. They’re cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB4ZzB"&gt;Despite their unassuming look, Oculus studied behavioral traits, like how often people usually blink and the speed at which their eyes shift around to look at points of interest, to make the new avatars seem more grounded in reality. It worked to make a compelling eye gaze, even though Oculus’ current headsets don’t track what your eyes are doing. Perhaps the next-generation Quest headset will, though. Mark Zuckerberg recently talked about eye tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “One of the things that I’m really excited about for future versions is getting eye tracking and face tracking in, because if you’re really excited about social presence, you want to make sure that the device has all the sensors to really kind of animate realistic avatars so you can communicate well like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="epic roller coasters" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_vQxbXNB_JTD1vOSUw0IQWvgP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464907/EPIC_ROLLERCOASTER.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Epic Roller Coasters&lt;em&gt; with avatars.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOMllw"&gt;As for making the rest of your body move in a believable way, Oculus is leaning on machine learning to make your arm and head movements look less stilted. It trained a prediction model that can guess your shoulder and elbow positions based on where the headset and Touch controllers are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Je1am"&gt;You can create a new avatar within the Quest and Quest 2 headsets by clicking into your profile. For Rift users connected to a PC, the new avatar editor will be located within the floating row of navigation buttons near the bottom of your field of view.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon tests letting sellers email customers directly about new products and sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TnKOFuYOgAPSYFzweNyRe0C1YGk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175673/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHGT0e"&gt;Amazon is testing a new feature for sellers that will let them contact customers directly by email to notify them of things like new product announcements or sales. It’s a major change from Amazon’s current policy, which is to limit the amount of interaction between customers and companies that sell on Amazon, outside of resolving things like returns or order issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEh4QB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/amazon-tests-tool-that-lets-some-brands-contact-shoppers.html"&gt;As CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt;, the new “Manage Your Customer Engagement” tool won’t let companies just spam previous customers with promotional emails. They’ll only be able to contact Amazon users who have specifically chosen to follow a particular company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tYayJT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwD_L7obHjo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P29wJg"&gt;Crucially, Amazon isn’t giving sellers blank-check access to customers’ personal contact information. Rather, Amazon will tell brands how many customers have opted to receive the emails, along with metrics and tracking of clicks through to product pages and any purchases that an email campaign results in — but not the names, information, or email addresses of individual customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVbSe5"&gt;The new email campaign option is a free service for sellers, but it’s only available to brands registered through Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://brandservices.amazon.com/"&gt;Brand Registry program&lt;/a&gt; (a list that includes big names like Garmin, GoPro, KitchenAid, and more). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tS9xL"&gt;But the new tool should be a useful one for brands that rely on Amazon’s store as a way to reach their customers by giving them a new way to loop in their most enthusiastic buyers of new products or deals. Customers who are wary of getting bombarded with thirsty brand deals, though, might want to take a look at which companies they’re currently following on Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: the two Apple events from this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HiSohv"&gt;You may have heard of the new Apple products announced at the company’s “Spring Loaded” event this week — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;the redesigned colorful iMac&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;location-tracking AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and the boosted specs on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;the next iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. But there was another big event focused on Apple this week: on Capitol Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBOZAJ"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0Wmd05zs48HYLqPq2AkWK3" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9H9lt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1HLZF"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, co-&lt;/em&gt;hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;Tuesday hardware event&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;Wednesday’s congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to antitrust in the App Store with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; politics reporter Makena Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXqqlO"&gt;The show bridges the gap between Apple announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; and Tile speaking in front of Congress the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a blueprint for the next decade of Marvel heroes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJXgK0"&gt;The season finale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22337849/falcon-winter-soldier-episode-1-recap-explainer-marvel-mcu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, bringing an end to the latest Marvel saga and settling the legacy of Steve Rogers and his emblematic shield. But the show doesn’t just answer the question of “Who is the next Captain America?” It charts a path forward for the next generation of Marvel heroes — and it uses a solution borrowed right from the comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL9HmU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YofjSvvUefEa41ZgzxYD8ve0cuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464589/GER7005_102_comp_v001.1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TvVtY2"&gt;As basically everyone expected, the finale of &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; sees Sam Wilson step fully into the role as the new Captain America — complete with a ripped-from-the-comics outfit and a new title card at the end of the series for “Captain America and the Winter Soldier.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5566896/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-review"&gt;Not to be confused with the 2014 film&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoFjkI"&gt;The six-episode series had its ups and downs; it rocked back and forth between high-flying action scenes, a meandering plotline, and portentous questions about legacy, race in America, and issues of global refugees. But the most important legacy of the show (which may or may not be getting a second season) might be how it solves one of Marvel’s biggest behind-the-scenes challenges: keeping characters fresh after almost a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZXHtj4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The obvious solution is to pass down the roles to new actors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kgiUPO"&gt;Marvel’s films effectively operate as a gigantic-scale TV series, with a massive ensemble cast that comes and goes across different episodes. Those episodes just happen to be two-hour-long big-budget movies. And like any long-running TV show, it starts to run into the issue of keeping its stars on the show as the costs rise and fatigue or boredom starts to set in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dowjM9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Man &lt;/em&gt;star Robert Downey Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/robert-downey-jr-avengers-endgame-salary-1202156978/"&gt;cost $75 million&lt;/a&gt; for his final appearance in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; (compared to $500,000 for his first MCU outing), and Chris Evans was so burned out from being Captain America that, at one point, he declared a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/03/chris-evans-says-he-will-basically-quit-acting.html"&gt;plan to quit acting altogether&lt;/a&gt; (although he hasn’t quite followed through yet). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36phH4lXQPmLe24E13kBlJg_saY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464600/TAG_102_11562_R_C.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2jQuo2"&gt;The obvious solution is to pass down the roles to new actors, much as the comics have done with Jason Aaron’s &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; run or G. Willow Wilson’s reimagining of Ms. Marvel. It’s a good solution, keeping characters fresh or allowing for new spins on the idea of what, exactly, makes someone Captain America (or Iron Man or Thor). It frees up actors from being stuck playing Tony Stark until they’re 80, lets storylines resolve, and gives characters room to grow instead of hitting the reset button each film. (There’s also the helpful side effect of keeping Disney’s costs down by rotating in a new, younger star who hasn’t skyrocketed to fame through years of superhero films yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P4hixC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The perfect blueprint for handing down heroic roles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDOSCd"&gt;In that regard, &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect blueprint for handing down heroic roles for the rest of Marvel’s universe. Sure, Disney could have just picked up in the next film with Sam Wilson wielding the shield that he got at the end of &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, but that kind of off-screen handoff would likely feel like a cop-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqJU4C"&gt;Instead, Disney devoted an entire miniseries to the transition. It explores how and why Sam doesn’t — and then ultimately does — choose to take up the shield, showcases different contenders for the title, and ultimately shows (instead of just telling) everyone why &lt;em&gt;Sam,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, is the right choice. Even more importantly, it gives fans &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; with Sam in a way his previous bows as Steve Rogers’ sidekick didn’t quite allow for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRSCmt"&gt;It’s the kind of strategy that Marvel is already gearing up to employ for other future second-generation Avengers. Later this year, we’ll see &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; hit Disney Plus, which looks to deal with a similar inheritance of Clint Barton’s role to Hailee Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop. The &lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Armor Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows set to stream in the coming years will look to explore a similar shift of Tony Stark’s legacy to War Machine and Riri Williams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Iron Man Suit (source: Paramount Pictures)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrSZQwdqRlCfecpahdcsf9X8IX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14619916/iron-man.1419980327.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OpmovB"&gt;Even the films are looking to get in on the action: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is rumored to &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/07/black-widow-florence-pugh-more-mcu-movies-1234571414/"&gt;see Florence Pugh take over the title&lt;/a&gt; of Scarlett Johansson’s Russian super-spy, and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; will see Natalie Portman wield the hammer as the new god of thunder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh1EXw"&gt;Giving these character changes room to breathe doesn’t just make for better storytelling, either; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;furthers the interconnectedness of the MCU’s storyline&lt;/a&gt;, making each subsequent show and movie a must-watch to understand the next one. And much like the first decade of the Marvel universe, it’s easy to see how Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios could bring all of these new heroes together for the kind of box office-shattering crossovers the Marvel films are known for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmj0ZG"&gt;After all, if it worked the first time, there’s no reason why Marvel can’t pull off the same trick with a new and more diverse generation of heroes again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humble extends its Spring Into VR Bundle into next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Job Simulator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1XQLGPQcEcr-bF4m5UF1zuUkhM=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175228/job-simulator-htc-vive-adi-robertson.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Job Simulator, HTC Vive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oif4zu"&gt;Last week, Humble launched its &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/spring-into-vr-bundle?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;Spring Into VR Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a pack of games for use with a virtual reality headset. Originally set to end on April 21st, the company has decided to extend the deal until April 28th, giving you more time to take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBS2M9"&gt;You can pay as little as $1 to receive one game or pay at least $15 to unlock all eight games available in the pack — once you’ve paid, you’ll get keys that you redeem on Steam. The bundle contains the following games, all of which are compatible with wired headsets that support Steam VR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qVyD9y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 2 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exIXJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O4DlSk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sairento VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IrOCET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Bridge Crew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s1MEuE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QpvZ4N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swords of Gurrah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APjjZg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Espire VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VoNmmA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detached&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jAQ8br"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10461935"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys0zRX"&gt;If you have been keeping up with the news about next-gen consoles, you will know that it is extremely difficult to purchase any next-gen gaming system. This includes not only the PS5, but some of its accessories, like the HD Camera.  If you managed to get your hands on a PS5 and are looking to buy this camera accessory, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595098-REG%2Fsony_3005726_hd_camera_for_playstation.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo has the product in stock and has knocked $10 off its original price&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nbqEF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1DfUC"&gt;While we are on the topic of PS5 accessories on sale, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595096-REG%2Fsony_3005715_dualsense_wireless_controller.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense controller is back down to its lowest price&lt;/a&gt; of $60 at B&amp;amp;H Photo. When you purchase a PS5, it includes one DualSense controller, but if you plan to share this console with other people or play local co-op games with friends and family, you’re going to want to purchase an extra controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EjTg5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7r5lMU"&gt;Finally, at our sister site, &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/the-strategist-two-day-actually-good-sale.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strategist&lt;/em&gt;'s Two-Day (Actually Good) Sale&lt;/a&gt; is underway. The two-day event contains deals on over 40 items selected by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Strategist&lt;/em&gt;'s editors. One highlight is Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones, which are marked down to $268 from $348 at B&amp;amp;H Photo. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda will phase out gas-powered cars by 2040</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Honda e Prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0vVt3aAmSS1VegWNB8yZEIb790=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175187/geneva_honda_eprototype_vladsavov33.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lFvha"&gt;Honda said it will stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2040. The automaker expects 40 percent of its sales globally to be comprised of battery-electric and fuel-cell vehicles by 2030, followed by 80 percent in 2035, and 100 percent of sales by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orTqvi"&gt;Honda is the latest car company to commit to an all-electric future, with General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo, and others making similar promises in recent months. Honda also said it would “strive to realize carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities” by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="krbdpv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe it is the responsibility of an automaker to achieve our carbon-free goal on a ‘tank-to-wheel’ basis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBF8i"&gt;The announcement came from Honda’s new CEO, Toshihiro Mibe, who took the helm in April. Speaking at a press conference, Mibe said that Honda was committed to helping Japan’s government reach its climate goal of a 46 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. “I believe it is the responsibility of an automaker to achieve our carbon-free goal on a ‘tank-to-wheel’ basis,” Mibe said, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIAkzI"&gt;Mibe said Honda will invest a total of about 5 trillion yen ($46.3 billion) in research and development initiatives, including electrification, over the next six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hg00dJ"&gt;Honda’s current electric lineup is limited. The automaker recently &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/03/09/honda-clarity-electric-vehicle-killed-honda-discontinues-ev/5001659002/"&gt;discontinued its Clarity EV&lt;/a&gt;, though it will continue to sell hydrogen and plug-in hybrid versions of the vehicle. Its Honda E electric city car started selling in Europe last summer. Honda also has plans to work with GM on the release of two new EVs, using the American company’s modular vehicle platform. And Honda has said it would release two electric SUVs in North America, but not until 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbqDcr"&gt;Honda’s electrification strategy will also extend to its lineup of motorcycles and scooters. The company plans to release three new electric models “in the area of personal use” by 2024, as well as an electric motorcycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG5GHK"&gt;Japanese automakers — Toyota in particular — once were the leaders in hybrid vehicles but have lagged behind American companies in the all-electric vehicle market in recent years. But with California banning sales of new internal-combustion engine vehicles by 2035, and the Biden administration moving toward taking the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;government vehicle fleet all-electric&lt;/a&gt; along with other plans to reduce emissions, automakers have their EV work cut out for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nier: Replicant is a second chance for a fascinating and flawed game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kmFjX7ZKIucKtrwOJK1D4BWH27k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174921/NIERRV1P2_SS_EV_KAINE.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7TpGT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is a shape-shifter. It makes you think it’s a simple action roleplaying game set in a bleak fantasy universe, but steadily reveals itself to be a lot more. It’s a game that shifts wildly in both tone and play style. It’s weird and heartbreaking, frustrating and playful, often all at the same time. This release is also a second chance for a game that failed to reach a big audience when it first launched in 2010, now updated for modern tastes. It still requires a little patience — but it’s worth putting up with some clunky gameplay to find all that &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42Qzeu"&gt;If the &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; name sounds familiar, it’s probably because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14875244/nier-automata-review-ps4-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 2017 action-RPG from director Yoko Taro and studio PlatinumGames that became a surprise hit. Its blend of tight action, haunting storytelling, and downright absurdity helped it reach an audience of more than 5 million players. It also renewed interest in the original &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt;, hence this new release, which has been given the incredibly awkward-but-fitting title &lt;em&gt;Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139… &lt;/em&gt;This version isn’t exactly a full remake but instead an updated version that sands off some of the original’s rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4O-ISWLHZu0ibRDNvFZt3bjEUb8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464422/NIERRV1P2_SS_EV_EMIL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U6Me9d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is not an easy game to explain. The story starts out in the near future, where some kind of plague is decimating humanity; it then fast-forwards a few thousand years into a future when the world is pretty much unrecognizable. There are elements of a traditional post-apocalyptic landscape, like the ruins of our society, but the world of &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; more closely resembles a fantasy realm with magic and monsters and lots of big swords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4XGU5"&gt;The fascinating world is a large part of the appeal, and you’ll spend a lot of time crisscrossing it over the course of &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt;. It’s bleak and desolate, with small pockets of humanity still surviving. The game puts you in the role of a young fighter on a desperate mission to cure his sister, who’s struggling from a strange and mysterious disease that’s steadily spreading throughout the world, which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; happens to be dealing with an onslaught of dark monsters called shades. It’s a dangerous place, and you’re eventually joined by a cast of characters including a talking spell book, a warrior perpetually dressed in lingerie, and a young boy with magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="skOjck"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1899294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ATrxgx"&gt;In some ways, &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is like a traditional fantasy RPG. You’re on an epic quest — which eventually includes not only finding a cure but fighting the big baddie in charge of all the monsters — and along the way you’ll acquire new abilities and weapons. But those aren’t the things that make &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; interesting. It’s when the game goes in unexpected directions that it’s at its best. You’ll visit strange towns, including one where the residents strictly follow thousands of rules, and another where everyone refuses to leave their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJoclZ"&gt;The most jarring moments, though, are when the game shifts genres. That includes exploring an underground research facility as if you were playing an isometric RPG like &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, and slinking your way through a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;-style haunted mansion. At one point, &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; basically becomes a novel where you read through a town’s shared hallucination. When the game returns to its standard action setup, it’s like waking up from a surreal dream.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0U7VDjVrnGhQiGZNFHhOaAfuvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464423/01.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vbSnEi"&gt;I didn’t play the original &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt;, so the most that I can say about the changes in this new version is that the game now feels a lot like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt; — which is to say it’s a mostly modern action game with fast and frantic combat, massive bosses, and an appropriately dreary world to explore. But despite the revamped visuals and gameplay, &lt;em&gt;Replicant &lt;/em&gt;still has some dated elements. For one thing, it’s very repetitive; you’ll be going on a lot of fetch quests and fighting countless, nearly identical shades along the way. These quests are often interesting narratively, but there are only so many times you can run across the same open field before it starts to get dull, especially since the game often forces you to revisit locations multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WASNe"&gt;It’s worth pushing through those mundane moments, though, because much like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely packed with fascinating, heartbreaking moments. There are big, obvious ones — characters sacrificing themselves for their friends or the torture of watching someone struggle with illness — but at times it feels like every moment in &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is tinged with sadness. There are twists that will make you question your own actions, and others that will completely change how you view a character. Hell, even the weapons have interesting stories; each new sword you get comes with its own brief snippet of lore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6I9re"&gt;It’s this heartfelt element that makes &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; worth experiencing (multiple times, if you want the full story). It may be clunky in places, and uncomfortable in others, but once you settle into its strange rhythm, there’s really nothing else like it — well, aside from &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. But this is exactly what you should play if you’re craving more of Taro’s unique vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSTTUH"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nier: Replicant &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now on the PS4, Xbox One, and Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1LYDo"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Tile-like AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, long-rumored and finally announced at this week’s Spring Loaded event, are now available for preorder on Apple’s website. The small circular trackers work with Apple’s “Find My” app on iOS and have a built-in speaker, accelerometer, Bluetooth LE, and a replaceable battery. They cost &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$29 for one set&lt;/a&gt; or $99 for a four-pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni2m3L"&gt;Apple says the AirTags’ battery should be good for a year. They should start delivering between May 3rd and May 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qp0xO"&gt;The existence of AirTags first became known nearly two years ago, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;copies of the iOS 13 beta&lt;/a&gt;. Apple accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;confirmed the AirTags name&lt;/a&gt; in a support video last year that has since been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DIeNW8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fi1d3g"&gt;Also revealed at Spring Loaded was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396502/purple-iphone-12-color-photos-shade-hue-lilac-lavender"&gt;new purple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. It’s identical to the other colors of the iPhone 12; it’s very fast, has a very nice screen, 5G, and great cameras, according to our review. It’s also available for &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;preorder today on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt; and will be widely available starting April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yytOgK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;2021 iMac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;new Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;new iPad Pro models&lt;/a&gt; Apple showed off at the Spring Loaded event will be available for preorder starting April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evercade is making a retro console for your TV called the VS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Evercade VS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b69TnBz18Vaa5aQz5KSBUzYhydE=/1x0:3508x2338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174631/evercadevslede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Evercade VS can stow two of the company’s proprietary cartridges at once.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Evercade&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaWc8E"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21271988/evercade-retro-games-handheld-review-classic-atari-namco-interplay"&gt;Evercade handheld that released in 2020&lt;/a&gt; can connect to your TV through its Mini HDMI port, but its 4.3-inch screen proves it was designed more for retro gaming on the go. Now, there’s a version of the Evercade just for your TV. It’s called the &lt;a href="https://evercade.co.uk/vs"&gt;Evercade VS&lt;/a&gt;, and it can output retro games at 1080p, delivering “top-of-the-line emulation,” with support for up to four wired USB controllers for multiplayer in games. It’ll cost $99.99 when it launches on November 3rd, 2021, and preorders start on May 28th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf9krI"&gt;Crucially, the Evercade VS will be able to play games from the same kind of proprietary cartridges used by the handheld, and this home console can store two at a time under the NES-style flap that opens at its top. Each cartridge allows for save and load states in its updated user interface, and you can pick up where you left off by swapping them between the Evercade VS and the Evercade handheld if you own both. In terms of visual options, it will support 4:3, “pixel perfect,” or full-screen modes as well as the option for scan line filters. The company says the handheld will receive these interface features in an update by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Evercade Vs" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A-fL2wiNCXGkZUFtb5hVvT0W46k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462767/evercadevskit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Evercade&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQQ8Im"&gt;Evercade will release its own controller, but you can use other USB controllers, including the Xbox Adaptive Controller, 8BitDo’s wireless controllers that have USB wireless receivers, and likely many others. Even the Evercade handheld can serve as a controller if you purchase a link cable. The console will include a Micro USB power cable but not a wall adapter. It also won’t include an HDMI cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lPIMt"&gt;This cross-device approach to the Evercade platform seems well-thought-out. Letting you take the games out of your handheld and pop them in the VS to play on TV is a power play for any kind of proprietary format, especially from a small company that’s paying IP holders a licensing fee for games that it writes to cartridge. That’s notable (and even commendable), but this approach has hit its first major snag in the jump to the home console: some of the Evercade’s most popular retro titles won’t work on the VS. Specifically, the two cartridges featuring Namco Museum collections are licensed exclusively for use on handheld, so the VS simply cannot play &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dig Dug&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Galaga&lt;/em&gt;, and the other games built into those cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjKqsp"&gt;Blaze Entertainment expects to have over 280 games available to play on its Evercade ecosystem by the end of 2021, and barring other licensing conflicts ahead of the VS’s launch, all games outside of the Namco Museum cartridges will be playable on the TV-based console. Also, the company is committing to all future cartridges supporting both the VS and the handheld.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify reportedly won’t take a cut from podcasters who sell in-app subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FUT6rGNyhpr3LM9XvG6ojTWcAAw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174513/acastro_180213_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a1TEE3"&gt;Spotify is reportedly planning to debut its in-app podcast subscription offering next week. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spotify-and-the-new-battle-over-who-wins-podcasting-11619170206?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company will not take a cut from podcasters who choose to sell in-app subscriptions and also will allow them to set their own pricing. Listeners on its iOS app will be routed through a website to purchase the subscriptions, thereby allowing Spotify (and podcasters) to skirt around Apple’s fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyKhaC"&gt;The news comes right after Apple Podcasts debuted its own in-app subscriptions. The company will allow podcasters to sell access to ad-free, bonus, or early-access content at whatever price they choose to set. Unlike this reported Spotify plan, however, Apple requires podcasters to pay $19.99 per year to even list their subscriptions, as well as a 30 percent cut for each subscriber’s first year. That drops to 15 percent for every following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSJsd5"&gt;It’s increasingly likely podcasters will have to manage their subscriptions across multiple platforms’ backends. Apple doesn’t allow podcasters to use RSS to distribute their exclusive content — it has to be uploaded manually through Apple’s system. Spotify has never accepted RSS, and presumably, podcasters will have to do something similar to get their subscription content on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AVaMs"&gt;The things we still don’t know: what kind of data, if any, Spotify will provide podcasters; how long this no revenue share agreement will last; if all podcasters will be able to participate; and whether content has to be exclusive to Spotify. We’ve reached out to Spotify for comment and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
