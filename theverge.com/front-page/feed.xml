    <title>There will never be another Pokémon Go</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NSrbkL"&gt;Creating a follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is an impossible task. The game was the kind of breakout success that had never been seen before — and might never happen again; it’s hard to overstate how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15888210/pokemon-go-one-year-anniversary-timeline"&gt;the game was absolutely &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; when it first launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. People were trespassing to catch Squirtles as the game set App Store download records. The wish fulfillment that came from seeing pokémon in the real world created a sensation that, even years after its peak, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;remains one of the biggest games in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZBrOq"&gt;It was only natural that developer Niantic would try to follow that with something new. But re-creating the lightning in a bottle that is &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t gone quite as planned, despite Niantic snapping up some enviable properties to adapt. After a year of early access, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan: Settlers&lt;/em&gt; will shut down later this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;which launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t fare much better: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759677/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shutting-down-january-2022-niantic-ar"&gt;the game is closing down next January&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not just Niantic, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;Microsoft also had little success with the short-lived &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560776/the-witcher-monster-slayer-ar-mobile-ios-android-game"&gt;A monster-hunting &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; game debuted in the summer to little acclaim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhuSdN"&gt;The obvious answer is that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was a fluke and that real-world, augmented reality games don’t have much of a future beyond catching pocket monsters. But there might be another reason for the string of failed releases: everyone is aiming too high.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Utyid4"&gt;Two things can be true. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is a once-in-a-lifetime hit that will never be replicated, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; location-based AR games have a future beyond it. You don’t need to look much further than Niantic’s latest release, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, to see that potential future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwA7fo"&gt;Whereas &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; both seemed like an attempt to create the next big thing, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; is much less ambitious. To start, it’s barely a game at all. &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is more of an app designed to encourage walking by making it more playful. I’ve been using it for around a week, and it’s more like pleasant background noise than an immersive game. You collect pikmin and fruit to feed them by going out for walks, and you can also grow new creatures by, you guessed it, walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3aCl"&gt;It’s a simple sort of gamification that adds just that little bit of extra incentive to head out of the house. It also has some charming Nintendo-esque touches (the game was co-developed by Nintendo and Niantic’s Tokyo studio), like the way you wave goodbye to your pikmin when they go out on expeditions or the scrapbook-like journal the game creates each day to remind you what you did. The simplicity of &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is what makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RszDen"&gt;As live service games have become more dominant, they’ve also run into an issue: players only have so much free time. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; may be massive ongoing hits, but they also leave little room for other similar games. The same is true for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;-style real-world games. The current iteration of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is surprisingly demanding; it requires going out to gyms to battle and navigating the tricky world of raising the strongest possible pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4rGvv4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFdpE3UHxzY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZS1zqh"&gt;Players have latched onto that, and many are willing to invest what &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; asks. They’ve been doing it for years at this point. But it’s also clear that other AR games aren’t able to capture the same level of attention. You can’t just take the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; formula and tack it on to another fictional world, even one as popular as &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;. If you could, we wouldn’t have this deluge of games shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECB16w"&gt;Which is what makes &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; so clever. It’s unassuming and demands little from you; it’s even set in one of Nintendo’s more niche fictional worlds. But the app also utilizes many of the things that made &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; such a success. The real-world integration gives you an excuse to venture a little further on a walk, so you can sow a few more flowers. The pikmin-planting mechanic encourages extra steps since walking helps make them grow. And then there’s the AR component, which lets you see what the cute, colorful plant creatures look like crawling around your living room or hanging out in a local park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xnkGA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; isn’t destined to be the next mainstream hit. It’s unlikely that we’ll see it create a deluge of memes and local news reports. Instead, it posits a much more realistic future for location-based AR games — one where a few small apps fit neatly into your life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Indiegogo switches gears to more closely screen crowdfunding campaigns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5mw5soWy9YDKHF8tx9ZQWGva3fw=/0x271:1080x991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085536/logo_lockup_white.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Indiegogo and GoFundMe have partnered to form the Crowdfunding Trust Alliance | Indiegogo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VYsa4f"&gt;Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo is changing the way it does business, shifting from an open platform where anyone can raise money for just about any purpose to a closed model where every campaign will receive a manual review before it can go live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4J3gCo"&gt;“Candidly, we have not always lived up to our backers’ expectations,” said Will Haines, vice president of product and customer trust at Indiegogo. When the company launched in 2008, there were few restrictions on would-be entrepreneurs seeking to raise money from like-minded backers. But Haines says that “open” isn’t what the crowdfunding community really wants now, more than a decade later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8KnkW"&gt;“Crowdfunding is not shopping — people generally understand that now — but it also shouldn’t be a leap in the dark,” he said. Backers count on the platform to be a safe and trusted space, Haines said. But, he added, “the risk has to be worth it, and backers need the tools to make an informed decision.” In addition to reviewing campaigns before they can launch, the company plans to work more closely with the entrepreneurs behind a campaign to ensure they have a solid plan and enough knowledge to bring their product or idea to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d72QKS"&gt;The new approach is being used on a small number of campaigns and will be rolled out more widely in the coming months, the company said. Indiegogo also has created an internal review board to oversee and evaluate the riskiest campaigns on its platform, as determined by its community of backers. The board can take action ranging from banning campaign owners from launching new campaigns, sending campaign owners to collections, and reporting them to law enforcement if necessary. Such actions would be reserved for campaigns Indiegogo believed to be working under “malintent” and if the company doesn’t hear back from a campaign owner after several attempts to contact them or failure to comply with its terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2DIuW"&gt;Haines said that Indiegogo’s mission at launch was to create a global network, where a community of entrepreneurs and enthusiasts could bring ideas to life. Built into that ethos was a negative perception of gatekeepers, Haines said. “Our biggest asset is the crowd, the people willing to take on some level of risk.” The company said between 2010 and 2020, Indiegogo contributions — the money backers give to campaigns — have grown by 5,515 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hhKfLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“... the thing you ultimately receive is not going to be exactly the sketch on the napkin.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVyXn3"&gt;Entrepreneurs, however — especially those seeking to raise money — have been incentivized to oversell their ideas and present them as groundbreaking or revolutionary, a mindset with which most crowdfunding backers are unlikely to be familiar. That can create something of a gap in understanding between the two sides. “Our job is to identify what’s needed to fill that gap, to make sure backers understand what the gap is,” Haines said. “What I see as the holy grail for us moving forward is not to remove all the risk but be clear about the level of risk. If you want to get in on something when it’s a sketch on a napkin, you should recognize that the thing you ultimately receive is not going to be exactly the sketch on the napkin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvkXvr"&gt;As part of its efforts toward cracking down on fraudulent campaigns, Indiegogo has partnered with fellow crowdfunding platform GoFundMe to create a new entity to establish best practices for the crowdfunding industry and to weed out bad actors who defraud well-meaning backers of crowdfunding campaigns. The companies describe the Crowdfunding Trust Alliance as a way for platforms to work collectively toward the goal of creating “clear trust and safety standards for the industry as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn8ZOV"&gt;The two companies haven’t yet invited Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform, to join the alliance, but an Indiegogo spokesperson said both companies want any reputable crowdfunding platforms involved and “absolutely encourage [Kickstarter] to join.” The founding members of the alliance will be reaching out to other platforms in the near future, the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk09Q5"&gt;It’s a bit of a shift for an industry that has largely disclaimed responsibility if a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21156136/ibackpack-smart-backpack-kickstarter-indiegogo-crowdfunding-scam-investigation-ftc-doug-monahan"&gt;campaign fails to deliver on its promises&lt;/a&gt;; they’re just the conduit, the platforms have maintained, and any crowdfunding backer assumes a certain amount of risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnLdBs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A high-profile failure reflects on the whole industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvDm2e"&gt;Under the terms of the new alliance, organizations won’t share confidential information, and third-party vendors won’t be allowed to join. To be eligible, an organization has to be well-established — at least three years old — and “generally respected” within the industry. Alliance members must unanimously approve any new applicants. So details about specific campaigns or campaign organizers wouldn’t be up for discussion, but members might share best practices to handle certain trust and safety situations they encounter, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8Lwvn"&gt;There’s good reason for crowdfunding as an industry to tighten oversight of people who would use their platforms for nefarious purposes; a well-publicized scam on one platform creates wariness among potential backers for any future crowdfunding effort. “A high-profile failure reflects on the whole industry,” Haines said. “It’s in all of our best interests that platforms are reputable.” He added that he doesn’t think it’s necessary to have every crowdfunding platform on board with the new alliance, but he’d be happy to see a larger reduction in scams. “If there’s nowhere for the fraudsters to go, that’s fantastic,” he said. “I want to get there.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zLBk2k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“... a lot of the bad folks collaborate pretty well”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eqiJp"&gt;Juan Benitez, president of GoFundMe, said working with other platforms will be key for reducing crowdfunding fraud across the board. “And I’ll be quite honest, you know, a lot of the bad folks collaborate pretty well,” he said. “So I think it’s very important for the platforms to collaborate and have sharing of best practices, technology and resources.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz4TuF"&gt;Benitez added that GoFundMe would welcome more members of the crowdfunding industry to join the new alliance. “That just collectively helps us all be stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFcNfp"&gt;In addition to expanding globally over the past decade, crowdfunding platforms have also evolved to include much more personal campaigns for things like medical bills or funeral costs. Benitez says he has found the variety of situations that people can be involved in to be striking. “It’s so amazing, and frankly energizing, for GoFundMe to be able to create a place where people can engage on those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqZ0VS"&gt;In a blog post &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@gofundme/39fe4c9125a0"&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; the alliance with Indiegogo, Benitez described the aftermath of the June building collapse in Surfside, Florida that killed 98 people. Many people wanted to donate to help the families of the victims, and many scammers were lined up to take advantage of that generosity, Benitez wrote. But the company was able to identify and remove 23 suspicious fundraisers before they could raise any money. Campaigns the company verified raised $2.4 million to help the Surfside families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZP1Ob"&gt;While scammers in crowdfunding get a lot of the spotlight, Benitez said the focus for GoFundMe remains on building a trustworthy and safe platform. “The reality is the vast, vast majority of activity on our platform is all good people trying to do good things and trying to help each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9lMOa"&gt;Haines says that in addition to creating more transparency about how crowdfunding campaigns are run, he sees Indiegogo playing more of a role in helping entrepreneurs on its platform be more successful overall, acting as a kind of coach. “Some campaigns don’t ever raise any money,” he noted. “But we want to focus our attention on where the backers are, because that’s where the risk is, and where the money is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19prAG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s inexpensive Air Quality Monitor plays nice with Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d885_j148nEww3MILHcT1jPwsUg=/0x0:4342x2895/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085546/Amazon_Smart_Air_Quality_Monitor_Lifestyle_Image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The air quality monitor (right) can show information on Echo Show devices. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3EZce"&gt;Amazon’s latest smart home device is the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/how-alexa-can-help-you-create-a-smarter-healthier-home"&gt;$69.99 Smart Air Quality Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a small puck around half the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;latest Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to keep an eye on the quality of the air in your home. It can track your home’s temperature and humidity, and the presence of dust, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc9d5A"&gt;A key selling point of the Smart Air Quality Monitor is its Alexa integration. It lets you ask compatible Alexa-enabled devices for an update on the air quality of the home at any time or view trends via the Alexa app or an Echo Show device. Importantly, the Smart Air Quality Monitor’s temperature sensor can also integrate with Alexa Routines. That allows it to function as a trigger for things like smart thermostats, ceiling fans, and blinds to help control a room’s temperature. If there’s a problem, it can issue warnings via Echo devices or the Alexa app to let you know you might, for example, want to open a window.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HO4GS0Y9rSRSDa0bMgUdhcKj_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982161/Amazon_Smart_Air_Quality_Monitor_Side_View_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device itself is fairly unassuming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQB5Cz"&gt;Outside of the Alexa integration, one of the biggest appeals of the Smart Air Quality Monitor is its relatively affordable price. It’s cheaper than the $89 Awair Glow C air quality sensing smart plug &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707146/awair-glow-c-smart-plug-air-sensor-nightlight-combo-review-price-specs-features"&gt;we tried out in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and almost half the price of &lt;a href="https://www.netatmo.com/en-us/aircare/homecoach"&gt;Netatmo’s popular Smart Indoor Air Quality Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which usually retails for $119.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qn6SyQ"&gt;Air quality is an increasing area of focus of smart home manufacturers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/6/17083908/dyson-pure-cool-air-purifier-cyclone-v10-cordless-vacuum-announcement"&gt;Dyson’s latest fans&lt;/a&gt; include air filters to remove pollutants like smoke or pollen, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623397/google-nest-hubs-air-pollution-smoke-alert-feature"&gt;Google updated its Nest Hubs&lt;/a&gt; in parts of the US to show data on outdoor air quality. Even Ikea’s gotten in on the action with a smart air purifier that’s built into, of all things, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fnew%2Fdiscover-a-smarter-way-to-clear-the-air-with-starkvind-air-purifiers-pub4c72a520&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F3%2F22761003%2Famazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a side table&lt;/a&gt;, and it offers a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fvindriktning-air-quality-sensor-60515911%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F3%2F22761003%2Famazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standalone air quality sensor&lt;/a&gt;. The ideal smart home has traditionally been one that’s well-lit and efficiently heated, but increasingly it’s one with good air quality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TZV1e"&gt;Amazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor is available to preorder today in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK for $69.99 / £69.99 / €79.99 and is scheduled to ship in December.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Turkey Mode coming to GE’s Wi-Fi connected ovens and ranges this week promises to cook the perfect turkey&lt;/em&gt; | IMAGE: Kriech-Higdon Photography&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SjT25"&gt;The smart kitchen is getting a little more intelligent this holiday season. Appliance manufacturer GE Appliances has a new Turkey Mode for its smart ovens that promises to take the prep and guesswork out of roasting that big bird. It arrives on over half a million GE connected ovens and ranges this week via an over-the-air software upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNqBos"&gt;The Kentucky-based GE Appliances gave me a demo of the new tech, and it’s pretty impressive. You put the bird in the roasting tin, pop it in a cold oven, insert the temperature probe built into the oven, push the Turkey Mode button (either on the LCD screen of the oven or in the GE SmartHQ smartphone app), and sit back and relax. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/na-H_1AqYxMPED30ECZeuYpIhsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982371/kriech_higdon_photo_2_1_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GE Appliances says cooking a turkey in its smart ovens will be as easy as insert probe and push Turkey Mode this holiday season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Org2"&gt;There is no basting, stuffing, brining, fiddling with foil, preheating, or panicking about whether it’s over or undercooked. And most importantly, there is no math; whether the bird is 12lbs or 20lbs, Turkey Mode calculates the cook time and executes its cooking algorithms to bring the bird to 170 degrees a few hours later. And if you want to, you can monitor the turkey and temperature in real time through the app or LCD screen. When it’s ready, the oven timer will go “Gobble, gobble.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NpTF5N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it’s ready, the oven timer will go “Gobble, gobble.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YeVOSb"&gt;Sabrina Hannah, a food scientist at GE Appliances, explained that her team cooked hundreds of turkeys to perfect the algorithms, and she’s confident your turkey will turn out just as perfectly juicy and crispy as the one they showed me in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6UeATVbCrhohPva0ouIvIXNiI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982383/Turkey_Mode_UPDATE_noticeLCD_FLOW.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GE Appliances&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkey Mode is part of GE Appliances smart oven’s Precision Cooking programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYkCKw"&gt;The Turkey Mode feature will be available in a total of 336 GE ovens, including Monogram, Café, GE Profile, and GE models. It’s part of GE Appliances Precision Cooking program available on its smart ovens that guides cooking everything from cakes and cookies to salmon and beef tenderloin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY39yF"&gt;Manufacturers are still struggling to convince people to buy smart versions of their large kitchen appliances. But innovations such as this one — and GE Appliances’ recent over-the-air update to add an air fryer mode to its ovens — help provide reasons to consider the upgrade next time you’re appliance shopping. An oven that gets new, helpful features like Turkey Mode after you’ve bought it is pretty smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jc3f3k"&gt;It can be difficult to figure out what to do when you’re asked to provide a hard copy of a document but don’t have access to a printer at home. While it used to be a safe bet that everyone had a printer at home, that’s no longer the case — but if you don’t have one, odds are that at some point, you’ll come across someone who hasn’t gotten the memo and insists on a hard copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0HN35"&gt;If you’ve found yourself in this situation, you’ve got options. To help, I’ve researched the various methods you can use to get a document from your computer to whoever needs it and have come up with a few tips and considerations for printing without your own printer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0mqi9"&gt;Before I get to that, though, you’ll have to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4UiFG3"&gt;Prepare to print&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h5BMec"&gt;Presumably, the file you want to print is on a computer, and you need some way to get it from there to another computer connected to a printer. Depending on what method you use, you may be able to upload your file to the internet and have it printed at a specific location (some services can even connect straight to cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox). If the printer — or the organization that owns the printer — doesn’t support uploads from the internet, you may have to put your file on a flash drive, probably one with a USB-A connector. If you’re unsure whether the place you’re going to accepts online files, check ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8zT9q"&gt;As for what kind of files you can print, different services support different file types. In my inquiries, Microsoft Word’s .docx and Adobe’s PDF formats were universally accepted, so that’s probably the way to go if you’re trying to print out text. If your Word document includes a lot of custom formatting, fonts, and / or images, you may want to export it as a PDF first to make sure it prints exactly how you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRODW6"&gt;After you’ve got that squared away, here are some of your options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nzFICX"&gt;Print at the library or school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2mQqtE"&gt;If you’re a student or have access to a public library, you can likely print documents there for free or at a low cost per page. There will probably be instructions for how to print something out on your institution’s website, or you can always ask a librarian for help. I was able to upload my document to the internet and then print it for free at any of my local library’s branches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3F01j"&gt;It’s worth noting that you probably won’t want to print out documents with sensitive content or personal info at these sorts of places — for one, you’ll likely be printing them from an unfamiliar web portal using an unfamiliar computer. It’s possible your school will let you print straight from your own laptop, but in any case, you’ll be printing on a network you don’t control, which means there’s some level of risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jaP8h"&gt;If the printer isn’t located close to the computer, there’s also always the possibility that someone else could have access to your document after it comes out of the printer, depending on how the library is set up. If you need to print medical documents or the like, you may want to look into other methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XwVh4l"&gt;Ask a friend or family member&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PMxZPZ"&gt;If you’re only going to be printing a page or two and have family members or friends who own a printer, it’s always worth asking them if you can use it. This can help avoid the privacy concerns that can come with printing using public hardware. While it may not be the best method if you want to print off an entire novel (unless you’re willing to repay their generosity by bringing your own paper and possibly an ink cartridge, depending on how many pages you’re doing), it could work for the occasional times when you need a hard copy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5BEpnI6syqyqOwZCyQ2j4Lkv74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22976488/2017_06_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shipping stores often also offer printing services for big and small jobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l402O4"&gt;Go to a business center like UPS or FedEx&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W44t4j"&gt;Shipping centers often provide printing services, too, whether for large jobs, like making a poster or banner, or for more mundane tasks, like printing out permission slips or routine forms. Some stores are branded specifically as print or business centers, but even ones that aren’t will likely be able to print out a few pages for you. There’ll be a cost associated with it, based on how many pages you print out — I paid $0.12 for a single-sided, black-and-white page at a local UPS store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvRUoD"&gt;Again — and somewhat surprisingly, given that these stores are business-oriented — this option may not be the best for sensitive documents. At the aforementioned UPS location, the printing process involved emailing an attachment to the store, which the employee would then open and print before handing me the resulting paper. It may be different at other stores and locations, but you’ll probably want to check before you make the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dv0GXI"&gt;Ask if you can print at work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F1WJc2"&gt;If you work in an office that has printers, and there aren’t strict rules around how they’re used, it may be worth asking your boss or IT department if you can use them to print a personal document or two. The worst that can happen is that they say no, and you may be surprised with a yes. I wouldn’t, however, recommend taking the “ask forgiveness rather than permission” approach, as many workplace printers are monitored for appropriate use (and the IT department can track whose computer each print job came from). In addition, you don’t want to get scolded (or worse) over a print job when there are other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZAXEN"&gt;Privacy is also a factor here — along with potential IT monitoring, the printer will likely be in a public area, and it’s possible that someone could end up picking up your documents by accident if they’re also using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QbOGs9"&gt;Pick up a print at an office supply store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="59SfV3"&gt;Stores like &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeHowToPrint110221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fservices%2Fprinting%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.officedepot.com%2Fa%2Fbrowse%2Fdocument-printing%2FN%3D5%2B1212282%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22737500%2Fprint-document-how-to-laser-inkjet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Office Depot&lt;/a&gt; (or an independent, local print shop) often give you the option to order printed documents online, then pick them up in person. While their websites’ printing service pages may be covered with splashy brochures and posters, you can also just order &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeHowToPrint110221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fservices%2Fprinting%2Fcopies-documents-printing%2Fsimple-prints%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regular printed documents as well&lt;/a&gt;. Both the stores I checked let me upload my document online and then pick it up the same day. They even offered to ship the documents to my house for an extra fee, though that wouldn’t necessarily be an economical option for printing a single document or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqQFXX"&gt;One of the benefits of using an office supply store is the range of options you get — you can print in color, for example, and choose what size and weight of paper you want to use (so you can, say, impress a prospective employer with a finely-printed hard-copy resumé). Depending on what tier of printing you are getting (some stores have “basic” and “professional” printing services), you can also pay to have your document stapled, hole-punched, laminated, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVDf4kWiAms1RYYyZvHzmJOTa-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960551/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.28.55.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Office Depot offered several options for customizing my print job, many of which would’ve been over-the-top for a single page but good for mass-printing documents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ivdnzt"&gt;That flexibility may extend to how you get your prints made as well. The Staples location I went to also offered self-service printing, where you could walk in and do the printing yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOhpnR"&gt;The downside is cost — printing a single simple page at Staples was $0.19, and printing a color, stapled, 10-page document on premium “cotton resume white” paper would cost $7.42. A similar print job at Office Depot would be $7.03. Switching to black and white substantially lowered the price, down to $3.27 and $2.93, respectively, so it’s definitely worth choosing that option if color isn’t important for your document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksIQ9U"&gt;While there are discounts available if you’re printing a ton of copies, it could be worth looking around to see if you could find less expensive options.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G6NxSL"&gt;Buy an inexpensive printer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QkjpWm"&gt;The solutions above can be great if you only have to print occasionally or if the locations are part of your everyday routine. But if you find that you have to go out of your way to print things more often than you’d like, and your space and budget allow for it, you may want to get an inexpensive printer. That could &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-DeskJet-2742e-All-in-One-Wireless-Color-Inkjet-Printer-Cinnamon-6-Months-Free-Instant-Ink-with-HP%2F236589360&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHowToPrint110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost anywhere from $60&lt;/a&gt; (or less if you can find a sale) for a basic wireless inkjet all-in-one (meaning it can also scan and copy) to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfU0egkQXci" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over $100 for a black-and-white laser printer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyaUzX"&gt;Inkjet printers will be cheaper and will be able to print in color, but the ink can be shockingly expensive. Refilling my $60 example printer’s ink &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-67-Black-Original-Ink-3YM56AN%2F640484654&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHowToPrint110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will cost you $30,&lt;/a&gt; and HP estimates that you’ll only get around 100 pages of printing from those cartridges. Replacing a laser printer’s toner is less expensive per page (my example’s refill &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfU0fgRPVNZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $50&lt;/a&gt;, but HP estimates you’ll get 1,000 pages out of it), and laser printers could be a better option for infrequent printers, as their toner won’t dry out as quickly as regular ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MYoln"&gt;If you’re looking for a guide on buying a printer, we have one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279634/best-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can check out here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ToLlfu"&gt;Do you need a hard copy at all? It’s a good idea to ask. Some people or organizations may be willing to accept an electronically signed document, or you may have the option to use a digital pass instead of a printed one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXAlS"&gt;There will definitely be times when you’ll absolutely need a hard copy, but in a lot of situations, it may be worth checking to see if a digital version will work.

    <title>Waymo is bringing its autonomous vehicles to New York City for (manually driven) mapping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJk-3T-wNCKNAXPnINz7YHYXutI=/127x0:1474x898/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085218/O0CtGcQE53rLMZODMK_XXR4sEcsD73_ZALIzuuhdA8Rv_XdvjlUgAraW_KzZ0W7he97FRwrbUjdA9K65kh6OqW7IXHNYaPUnz6_Klq2c1c3Wz4GioI7WdAutNZd2d1PsxDgZebJSRQ.5.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8dfA5r"&gt;The latest autonomous vehicle company to tackle the mean streets of New York City will be Waymo. The Google spinoff is bringing a handful of cars to the Big Apple, where they will start mapping the city streets using manually driven vehicles with two people riding inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qul4g"&gt;Waymo cited New York’s vibrant street life, “unusual road geometries” (which is a nice way of saying utterly confusing), and the likelihood of heavy rain and snow as being among the reasons the company is eager to test there. Presumedly the company is also curious to see how its vehicles will react when down-on-their-luck street hustlers slap their hoods and shout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z-tCU-sULA"&gt;“I’m walking here!”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ndLN0"&gt;Waymo won’t have more than five vehicles on the street at a time to start out, a spokesperson said. They will be driving in Manhattan, primarily south of Central Park, and eventually extending down through the city to the financial district and also out to a small section of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel. The fleet will consist of Chrysler Pacifica minivans, equipped with high-powered sensors and computing units, at first. Later they will include the company’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lEHfc4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear when the cars will begin to drive in autonomous mode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPJm7H"&gt;It’s not clear when the cars will begin to drive in autonomous mode. But New York City is obviously a huge, complex stage on which Waymo is eager to demonstrate the effectiveness of its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvD9Rm"&gt;New York City also has some of &lt;a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/06/30/new-york-city-worst-traffic-in-the-country/"&gt;the most dangerous, congested, and poorly managed streets&lt;/a&gt; in the world. They are also chock-full of construction workers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and double- and sometimes even triple-parked cars. In theory, this would make it very difficult for an autonomous vehicle to navigate, given that AVs typically rely on good weather, clear signage, and less aggressive driving from other road users for safe operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqMaTA"&gt;While other states have become hot beds for AV testing, New York has been a bit of a ghost town. Part of the reason could be the state’s strict rules, which include mandating that safety drivers keep their hands on the wheel at all times and requiring state police escort at all times to be paid for by the testing company — though the state hasn’t enforced the latter requirement in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIQnty"&gt;A spokesperson for Waymo said its operations “do not meet NY’s current definition for testing and are therefore not subject to permitting requirements.” The company has proactively reached out to “relevant lawmakers,” including Governor Kathy Hochul, about its plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLADIj"&gt;Waymo says it has been in contact with “many New York policymakers, regulators, industry leaders, and non-profit groups to get their feedback, and we’re encouraged by the responses.” The company provided a quote from Eric Adams, who was just elected mayor, declaring himself “excited” to host Waymo’s small fleet of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3YbLr"&gt;Of course, many residents believe that New York City doesn’t need more cars — it needs fewer. Congestion in the city is arguably worse than ever, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/01/dont-walk-this-way-58-more-nyc-pedestrians-killed-in-2021/"&gt;pedestrian deaths are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and the city’s leaders have done little to stem the chaos. Waymo says its cars are safer, but they’re still cars that occupy the same amount of space as human-driven vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEoOvV"&gt;Waymo won’t be the first company to attempt to navigate New York City’s unique brand of vehicular chaos. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16488330/gm-cruise-nyc-self-driving-car-test-cuomo"&gt;GM-backed Cruise announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to test its self-driving vehicles in lower Manhattan, but &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/gms-plan-to-test-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-city-seems-1828945330"&gt;those plans were later scuttled&lt;/a&gt; with little explanation as to why. Boston-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20755163/new-york-city-self-driving-shuttle-service"&gt;Optimus Ride has been testing autonomous shuttles in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, but only on private roads as part of the borough’s Navy Yard. Mobileye, a division of Intel, also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585338/intel-mobileye-autonomous-vehicle-av-testing-nyc"&gt;began testing its vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in the city. Meanwhile, operators flocked to places with friendlier regulations (like Arizona) or ones that are more convenient to their headquarters (like California).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFi6l2"&gt;Waymo is operating a robotaxi service in Phoenix, some of which include completely driverless vehicles. It’s also testing its vehicles in San Francisco, where it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702962/cruise-waymo-california-dmv-autonomous-vehicle-permit"&gt;recently received&lt;/a&gt; permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to offer rides to passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thaer6"&gt;But in order to give rides to paying passengers in its fully driverless vehicles, as it does in Arizona, the Google spinoff would need to apply for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591045/california-robotaxi-paid-rides-cpuc-permits"&gt;additional permit from the California Public Utilities Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has a number of vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903034/waymo-self-driving-test-la-mds-data"&gt;in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; performing a similar task as they will in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFPiem"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Eternals is big, beautiful, and empty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nGD3QseZ9t46Bvv7wIjIOsxyDPk=/6x0:8466x5640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085295/SLH_16959_R_CROP.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sophie Mutevelian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Marvel’s epoch-spanning epic has too many heroes but still feels empty&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oHojHO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is Marvel’s biggest swing in years. It’s an attempt at a prestige-style film directed by Chloé Zhao, fresh off her Oscar win, at a size and scale that none of Marvel’s previous films have tried. But despite its grand ambitions, the film gets lost in its ponderous ideas and caught in the constraining box of what an MCU film has to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4LESR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; aspires to an almost biblical scope. The opening crawl of the film (yes, there is an opening crawl) reads like an early page of the Book of Genesis, explaining who Arishem, the Prime Celestial, brought light to the universe. The film bounds across thousands of years of human history, has no less than 10 main characters, four villains, a love quadrangle, and even Marvel’s first on-screen sex scene. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2AkKhL_wMPdNbwBlpLZqD2otbc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980788/TBB1100_comp_v044.1129.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals has a galactic scale, to mixed effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FMaq02"&gt;The basic plot of &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is as follows: for thousands of years, a team of immortal superheroes — the eponymous Eternals — has been living in secret amongst humanity on Earth, sent by the god-like Celestials to help nurture mankind and protect them from the villainous Deviants. The Eternals have spent centuries hidden among humanity, their epic feats mistaken for mythological gods. (But, as the film explains, the Eternals were &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; allowed to protect against Deviants, hence their absence in the many, many world- and universe-threatening crises of the previous MCU films.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1MNGuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a lot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuZ2U"&gt;The core Eternals team is comprised of 10 main characters, each with their own special powers: Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can transmute objects to different elements; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who basically is a Marvel-ized Superman with flight and laser eyes; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), who can fire energy blasts from his hands; Sprite (Lia McHugh), who can cast illusions; Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), a superhuman inventor; Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who has super speed; Druig (Barry Keoghan), with mind control powers; Gilgamesh (Don Lee) with super strength, and Thena (Angelina Jolie), a powerful warrior who can summon weapons from thin air. Leading the bunch is Ajak (Salma Hayek), the “Prime Eternal,” who possesses healing powers and can commune with Arishem as a sort of priest/mother for the rest of the Eternals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hy3hB"&gt;If that feels like a lot, it’s because it is. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; does its best to introduce the characters, along with their relationships, powers, and goals, but it’s a lot of backstory to cram into the two-and-a-half-plus-hour film. (That makes it the second-longest MCU movie to date, after the three-hour &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame.&lt;/em&gt;) By default, some of the Eternals are more “main” characters than others: Cersei and Ikaris get a lot of time to hash out their relationship, while Phastos and Makkari are effectively side characters. Nanjiani’s Kingo does the best to steal the show — his character has spent his centuries on Earth building a Bollywood dynasty — but he still gets sidelined a lot in favor of the more central characters.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed7x9d2hU18c4LwXe2t50MgHY7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980795/DCA3100_comp_v006_046585.1097_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Some of the many main characters in Eternals&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpHm2t"&gt;It’s not that Marvel movies can’t handle this many characters. The jam-packed Avengers films, or even the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, are testaments to the studio’s talent at coherently cramming dozens of heroes into a single film. But &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; has an uphill battle that starts with the fact that we’re meeting all these characters for the first time despite Marvel’s 20-plus films and shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhlKPr"&gt;All of this would be fine if the Eternals were actually doing interesting things. But the first half of the film consists largely of showing us how the Eternals drifted apart 6,500 years into their mission of hunting Deviants and a “getting the band back together” sequence of slowly reassembling the team to battle the resurgent Deviant threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hl3ru3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; constantly bounces between not having enough and too many things going on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2WSyt"&gt;A mid-movie lore dump helps kickstart an actual plot, but even that consists more of different combinations of Eternals standing around and arguing over a cosmic-scale trolley problem. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is constantly bouncing around between not having enough going on and suddenly having too much to be concerned about. One of &lt;em&gt;Eternals’&lt;/em&gt; antagonists doesn’t appear until nearly two hours in. Another persistently shows up in the movie but isn’t even given a name on-screen. A key character simply opts out of the third-act fight sequence entirely, unremarked by any other characters until returning out of thin air for the film’s conclusion. And of course, Marvel can’t help itself from hamfistedly setting up future sequels and spinoffs in Eternal’s cliffhanger ending and post-credit scenes (of which there are two, both of which feel more like moments to elicit gasps from comic book fans than any real concrete teaser).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/273pqYxESd2IAb2sI9EY8gydOao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980799/BAB1300_comp_v021_060057.1188.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ry1xhD"&gt;For all its flaws in plot and pacing, Eternals is a beautifully shot movie. A lot has already been made about &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/directors/chloe-zhao-oscars-nomadland-marvel-eternals-dracula-1234961719/"&gt;director Chloé Zhao’s insistence&lt;/a&gt; at shooting much of the film in actual, real-world locations instead of the MCU’s characteristic green screen sets, and the difference is clear. &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;’ dusty deserts, clouded beaches, and lush rainforests feel &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in a way that the CGI landscapes often don’t, with soaring views and sunsets lending a tangibility to the more fantastical goings-on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IA3E5r"&gt;The requisite fight scenes are also great; the Eternals put together its toy box of complementary powers to fun effect, and the golden curlicues that are used as the visual shorthand for everyone’s powers are a nice change from Marvel’s typical color-coded energy blobs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5t10pG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Marvel’s most diverse film yet (although the bar is exceedingly low)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zn56s"&gt;Eternals is also Marvel’s most diverse film by far, a bar that, while being so low as to be easily stepped over, is still an achievement to note, belated as it is in the studio’s decade-plus-long run. It is legitimately refreshing to see a wider range of actors on screen beyond the cadre of Chrises, even if the much-hyped debut of Brian Tyree Henry’s gay hero practically feels shot in a way to make it as easy as possible to excise for overseas box office requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICx8aJ"&gt;Ultimately, though, Eternals tries to be too much — and it suffers for it. The film’s lofty goal of being a creation myth for the Marvel universe has potential, but it’s far too much to cram into the constraints of a modern superhero film. It’s no use seeing where these heroes came from if we don’t have enough time to care about who they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSFP8e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTKSVq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats’ infrastructure bills don’t go far enough on cleaning up the power grid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US President Joe Biden during the World Leaders’ Summit of the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on November 2, 2021." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LwKMcJ5YoqNB5FCO04laZFdr68=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085177/1236294440.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gnx254"&gt;On a call Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied Democrats to pass two ambitious bills at the heart of President Biden’s agenda, aiming for a final house vote later this week. But the climate provisions of the $1.75 trillion budget reconciliation bill that progressives want to pass alongside a bipartisan infrastructure bill are newly uncertain after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) pushed to further delay the vote during a surprise press conference on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jOOOq"&gt;It’s the latest twist in a long struggle for Congress to pass meaningful legislation in support of the ambitious climate goals President Biden set on entering office. The reconciliation framework released last week puts $555 billion into clean energy, the first major effort to meet the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/"&gt;Biden administration’s goal&lt;/a&gt; of a power grid running entirely on carbon-free electricity by 2035. But while this bill and the companion infrastructure bill do a lot to speed the growth of clean energy in the US, experts say these two bills won’t get Democrats all the way there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JTiPw5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A really good down payment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u6cQLQ"&gt;“Is it going to be enough? No,” says Leah Stokes, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “This is a really good down payment on the progress that we need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHFB9P"&gt;The bulk of climate funds in the White House’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/28/build-back-better-framework/"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; for the reconciliation bill are for $320 billion in tax incentives for clean energy technologies. Existing tax incentives for wind and solar energy projects give people and utilities some relief from federal income taxes. A key change in this bill is that it would offer direct pay as an alternative. That gives utilities more incentive to build out renewable energy projects since they don’t have a lot of federal tax liability, according to Stokes. There are also new tax credits for batteries and energy storage, microgrid controllers, and other carbon-cutting technologies. The bill also gives home and building owners rebates for electrification projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXyQ4t"&gt;The reconciliation bill would also put significant funding behind supply chains and infrastructure for a future clean energy economy. That includes money to build out brand-new offshore wind infrastructure and a national network of electric vehicle charging stations. Rural communities, which often lack a big enough customer base to fund new projects that require a lot of up front investment, would get nearly $10 billion in grants and loans to transition to renewable energy. Plus there’s $20 billion allocated to incentivize governments to purchase next-generation technologies, including modular nuclear reactors, batteries, and other ways to store renewable energy for long periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bgSYMr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They’ll need to close a huge gap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NiudpQ"&gt;The reconciliation bill also includes $2.8 billion to site and build new transmission lines, which would add to another &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/climate-electricity-infrastructure.html"&gt;$73 billion&lt;/a&gt; investment in grid upgrades written into the separate infrastructure bill. For the grid to operate entirely on clean energy, thousands of miles of new transmission lines will need to be built to bring that energy from far-flung wind and solar farms and hydroelectric dams to the places where people live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRGE2q"&gt;Ultimately, one of the biggest challenges Democrats face with cleaning up the grid and tackling climate change is getting enough renewable energy online in the first place. They’ll need to close a huge gap between how much new clean energy is built each year and how much is needed to reach their climate targets. 2020 saw the most new wind and solar capacity installed, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42495"&gt;32GW&lt;/a&gt;, in a single year, according to the Energy Information Administration. But between 60 to 70GW of new clean energy capacity needs to be added each year over the next several decades, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-Long-Term-Strategy.pdf"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; document Biden released on November 1 on how his administration plans to meet its longer-term goal of completely slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. A clean grid by 2035 is a key milestone on the path to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AqzBk"&gt;It will be even harder to close that gap after Manchin effectively ended a policy that had previously been at the heart of Democrats’ clean energy strategy. The &lt;a href="https://grist.org/politics/meet-the-cepp-the-biggest-federal-climate-policy-youve-never-heard-of/"&gt;Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP)&lt;/a&gt; would have paid utilities to use more carbon-free energy and penalized them for sticking to dirty sources, pushing utilities to add progressively more clean energy each year. As recent as a &lt;a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/se/date/2021-10-21/segment/01"&gt;CNN Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; on October 21st, Biden said the CEPP was still on the table — with the caveat that Manchin was opposed to it. By the time his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751099/white-house-budget-climate-electric-vehicles-ev-tax-credit-deal-manchin-sinema"&gt;framework was released&lt;/a&gt; a week later, the program was gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cd80OB"&gt;“This is one place where the loss of the CEPP really does make it harder for certain because it was going to send a really clear nationwide signal,” says Leah Rubin Shen, policy director at Advanced Energy Economy, an association of clean energy businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ThXrz"&gt;All the back-and-forth weakens the US’s credibility during the United Nations’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;climate summit&lt;/a&gt; taking place over the next couple weeks. By replacing the CEPP with more clean energy incentives, the White House still expects measures in the reconciliation bill to cut “well over” &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-renews-u-s-leadership-on-world-stage-at-u-n-climate-conference-cop26/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=177665638&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz%E2%80%94MbeUJB3_hmNUMQVeXJMpQiXoqd-g-8RInqqYGD63XKyGafiYj8zPIAMpDFxBZQYwdlrX3AyGdN_yvh4H2BkC0qC7Ccv2otrYoXV3O_eJNhP_WzvU&amp;amp;utm_content=177665638&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;1 gigaton of greenhouse emissions&lt;/a&gt; annually by 2030 so that the US can fulfill commitments it made under the Paris climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui9bt5"&gt;To help close the gap, Biden could direct the EPA to step in with tougher pollution regulations on power plants, as the Obama administration tried to do. States and municipalities will likely have to help make up for the federal shortfall with their own clean electricity standards, too. One in three Americans already live in a place that’s targeting 100 percent clean power, according to Stokes. That includes states like Colorado and California, and cities like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22735645/new-orleans-east-hurricane-ida-entergy-power-shift"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pvqond"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We came really close.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKRcEH"&gt;“It’s going to continue to be incumbent on state and local governments to drive forward the power sector transformation with the passage of the 100 percent clean electricity laws,” says Sam Ricketts, co-founder and co-director of nonprofit Evergreen Action that pushed for the CEPP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35BbEq"&gt;Advocates are also keeping some hope that federal clean electricity standards could resurface in the future. But that could hinge on the long shot that midterm elections break the congressional stalemate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOWJfZ"&gt;“Look, we came really close. We were one senator away from passing a transformative electricity investment program,” Stokes says. “That’s closer than we’ve ever been.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ej7qjz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEgww9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google News to relaunch in Spain after mandatory payments to newspapers scrapped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5UGeanF61rutptGazygIU68AKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70084975/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zd85vS"&gt;Who should get paid when big tech platforms aggregate news stories? This was the question that prompted Google to &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/google-news-spain/"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; its Google News platform in Spain in 2014, after the country decided the US tech giant should cough up a monthly fee to Spanish papers. Today, though, Google announced that Google News &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/google-news-in-spain"&gt;will return to Spain&lt;/a&gt; “early next year” after the country overhauled its online copyright laws in line with EU regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVcwQg"&gt;The big difference from Google’s point of view is that it no longer has to pay a fee to Spain’s entire media industry and can instead negotiate fees with individual publishers. Some may want to charge Google for sharing stories in Google News, and Google can pay them or exclude them, depending on its preference. Other outlets will no doubt waive these fees, judging that the traffic offered by Google News outweighs any lost advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5EdZgK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says it will try to “reach agreements” with Spanish publishers in the coming months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ed00mK"&gt;Google says it’ll be working in the coming months with publishers “to reach agreements which cover their rights under the new law.” But just try to guess which side of the bargaining table will have the upper hand. Will it be lone newspaper outlets, struggling against plummeting revenues and industry-wide change? Or will it be the international megacorp that’s one of the most profitable companies in the world? Anyone? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igy77l"&gt;Really, though, the return of Google News to Spain is just a single skirmish in a long running battle between Europe’s media industry and Big Tech. The former complains that the internet has undermined its business model, and that profits from this new economy have been hoovered up by Google and its kin. The latter reply, “oh well, yeah, I guess so, sorry about that,” and throw some of their megabucks at various “sustainable journalism” initiatives. It’s not exactly been a happy solution, particularly for media companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUU7nH"&gt;To try and rebalance the playing field, many countries have passed or toyed with legislation similar to Spain’s in recent years, including Germany and Belgium. In 2019, these efforts were folded into an EU-wide reform of online copyright law known as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18280726/europe-copyright-directive"&gt;Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z1N0Z"&gt;If you remember this legislation at all, it’s probably for its so-called “upload filter,” a provision which, in its worst reading, requires tech platforms to check all data uploaded to their sites against copyrighted work. (The difficulty of actually implementing this provision is helpfully illustrated by the fact that the EU Commission is currently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commission-starts-legal-action-against-23-eu-countries-over-copyright-rules-2021-07-26/"&gt;suing its own members&lt;/a&gt; for failing to do so.) However, the Copyright Directive also dealt with payments to media companies for use of their content, and it’s &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; part of the legislation — which Spain recently adopted into national law — that has ultimately led to the return of Google News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXjpNa"&gt;It’s far from the only attempt by countries to give more power to their ailing but vital news industries. In 2020, Google announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302791/google-news-publishers-pay-content-australia-germany-brazil"&gt;new payments&lt;/a&gt; to publishers in Germany, Australia, and Brazil, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/"&gt;signed a similar deal with French papers&lt;/a&gt; (also in response to the EU Copyright Directive). Such agreements will no doubt continue to be passed and then superseded as the news industry changes and evolves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI ordered to delete all facial recognition data belonging to Australians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ud0r0rpmpxeY-60SLjM0Km24ufU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70084720/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RBoJJZ"&gt;Controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/clearview-ai-breached-australians-privacy"&gt;destroy all images and facial templates&lt;/a&gt; belonging to individuals living in Australia by the country’s national privacy regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr2CQz"&gt;Clearview, which claims to have scraped 10 billion images of people from social media sites in order to identify them in other photos, sells its technology to law enforcement agencies. It was &lt;a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/afp-admits-to-trialling-controversial-facial-recognition-tool-clearview-ai-546729"&gt;trialled by the Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) between October 2019 and March 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQAnQF"&gt;Now, following an investigation, Australia privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), has found that the company breached citizens’ privacy. “The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair,” said OAIC privacy commissioner Angelene Falk in a press statement. “It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I3o8Pw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hF4zbb"&gt;Said Falk: “When Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent by a commercial entity to create biometric templates for completely unrelated identification purposes. The indiscriminate scraping of people’s facial images, only a fraction of whom would ever be connected with law enforcement investigations, may adversely impact the personal freedoms of all Australians who perceive themselves to be under surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emHVfC"&gt;The investigation into Clearview’s practices by the OAIC was carried out in conjunction with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). However, the ICO has &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/clearview-statement/"&gt;yet to make a decision&lt;/a&gt; about the legality of Clearview’s work in the UK. The agency says it is “considering its next steps and any formal regulatory action that may be appropriate under the UK data protection laws.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9th3t"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/facial-recognition-firm-cleaview-ai-to-appeal-order-to-stop-collecting-images-of-australians"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clearview itself intends to appeal the decision. “Clearview AI operates legitimately according to the laws of its places of business,” Mark Love, a lawyer for the firm BAL Lawyers representing Clearview, told the publication. “Not only has the commissioner’s decision missed the mark on the manner of Clearview AI’s manner of operation, the commissioner lacks jurisdiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fVxLu"&gt;Clearview argues that the images it collected were publicly available, so no breach of privacy occurred, and that they were published in the US, so Australian law does not apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXHtX2"&gt;Around the world, though, there is growing discontent with the spread of facial recognition systems, which threaten to eliminate anonymity in public spaces. Yesterday, Facebook parent company Meta announced it was shutting down the social platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759613/meta-facebook-face-recognition-automatic-tagging-feature-shutdown"&gt;facial recognition feature&lt;/a&gt; and deleting the facial templates it created for the system. The company cited “growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole.” Meta also recently paid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304618/judge-approves-facebook-privacy-settlement-illinois-facial-recognition"&gt;$650 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; after the tech was found to have breached privacy laws in Illinois in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
