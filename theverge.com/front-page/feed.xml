    <title>Apple supplier Foxconn warns that component shortages will last until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WM8czH"&gt;The ongoing global shortage for electronic components continues, and Foxconn — which handles manufacturing for Apple, among other major tech heavyweights — has announced that it’s starting to see the impact of shortages. According to Young Liu, Foxconn’s CEO, the company won’t be able to fulfill some of its orders due to those shortages, which he expects will last until &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; the second quarter of next year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-supplier-Foxconn-says-chip-shortage-will-curb-shipments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8UU8a"&gt;“The [supply in the] first two months of this quarter was still ok, as our clients are all very big, but we started to see changes happening this month,” Liu reportedly told investors during the company’s latest earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbl2tS"&gt;The impact of the shortages isn’t expected to be large, at least for now: Liu expects that the company will only miss around 10 percent of its orders due to part shortages, citing the large order volumes of its customers. But it’s still a notable miss for Foxconn — and by extension, its customers like Apple — who may be forced to contend with delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Zz4z8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;10 percent &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NA0e8c"&gt;Foxconn also saw slowdowns in manufacturing last spring at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, following mandatory government shutdowns and quarantined factory workers. Those delays trickled down across the supply chain, leading to a later-than-usual November launch for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238081/apple-iphone-12-mass-production-delay-rumors-coronavirus-impact#:~:text=Apple%20is%20reportedly%20delaying%20mass,iPhone%2012%20mass%20production%20plans."&gt;Apple’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. The current slowdown, by comparison, seems less drastic, but if parts continue to be hard to get, delays could mount later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg2Ybt"&gt;Foxconn is the latest company to call out the ongoing chip and component shortage that has slowing down production of everything from next-generation consoles to cars. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;Samsung warned its investors&lt;/a&gt; of a “serious imbalance” in the semiconductor industry as it prepares to deal with the ongoing global chip shortage. Car companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2021/02/03/nissan-truck-production-reduced-canton-plant-due-chip-shortage/4369759001/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have have had to slow truck and car production due to a surfeit of silicon. Both Sony and Microsoft have both cited part shortages as major factors in the near-impossible-to-buy status of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. And the aftermarket value of PC graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;has doubled, even tripled&lt;/a&gt;, due to a combination of unprecedented shortages and demand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s Spectacles might become true AR glasses this time — and there’s a drone  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="snap spectacles" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IV9E0rbmQyDYoOE4UbPjyILFxQc=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051718/Specs4.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first generation Snap Spectacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wn1zJP"&gt;Snap, the company behind Snapchat, is planning to continue its push into hardware devices with a new pair of augmented-reality glasses and a drone, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-plans-hardware-push-with-ar-spectacles-drone"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Spectacles will reportedly include displays so the wearer can see the AR effects without having to use their phone — a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20951783/snap-spectacles-3-review-snapchat-glasses-price-specs-features"&gt;was notably missing&lt;/a&gt; from the all the Spectacles that came before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F88tko"&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources says that the new Spectacles will be meant for developers and creators, rather than consumers — though you could probably argue that, at $380, the Spectacles 3 are already mostly limited to that market as well. As the article points out, though, the intention is likely to have the developers make lenses and experiences that consumers will use at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sEhL8X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Snap may not be backing down from its hardware dreams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5R0XN"&gt;If the new Spectacles act as an AR headset, it could be the culmination of what the company has been working towards with the first three versions of the product. Currently, the Spectacles are mainly capture devices, acting as head-mounted cameras with the bulk of the processing being done on the user’s phone. This hasn’t necessarily been a recipe for success: the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16620718/snapchat-spectacles-40-million-lost-failure-unsold-inventory"&gt;lost $40 million&lt;/a&gt; when it was stuck with unsold inventory of the original pair, and the company’s hardware head &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17607834/head-snapchat-spectactles-augmented-reality-mark-randall"&gt;left shortly after the second-generation glasses came out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5w28Bk"&gt;If the reports about the new Spectacles are true, it could indicate that Snap isn’t backing down from its hardware dreams — &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-snapchat-looks-a-lot-like-magic-leap/"&gt;the company’s CEO has said&lt;/a&gt; that AR hardware will be part of what defines Snap by the end of this decade. If it wants to continue pushing its AR glasses, it seems like it will have to contend with competition from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;— both companies seem to be developing their own face-mounted wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSqVIC"&gt;As for the drone, there’s precious little information about it. There have been rumors about Snap working on a drone &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/technology/snapchat-drone.html"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, and back in 2017 it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/27/15704906/snap-ctrl-me-robotics-acquired-drone-cameras"&gt;acquired a drone company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Snap invested $20 million into a Chinese drone company as well. There’s no information on when the drone will ship, but the report’s sources say that it’s recently been made the priority of Snap Lab, a hardware group at Snap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2r3c9"&gt;In other AR headset news,&lt;em&gt; The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ti-reality-check-a-tease-of-ars-future-and-a-look-at-vrs-past"&gt;also reported today&lt;/a&gt; that the headset &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/niantic-ar-headset-teaser-225310953.html"&gt;teased by Pokémon Go creator Niantic&lt;/a&gt; is actually a reference design made by Qualcomm — the two companies announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997493/niantic-qualcomm-xr2-ar-glasses"&gt;that they were partnering back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Niantic is also reportedly looking to go the developer-first route as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gocycle’s folding G4 e-bikes promise more power and less noise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nst8va1QLqnXjGkNBjiC_Uszqa8=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051524/Gocycle_Generation_Four_Location___7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gocycle e-bikes are small but still great for long commutes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gocycle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hMzws9"&gt;Gocycle, the maker of some of the most eye-catching and adaptable electric bikes on the planet, is back with its fourth-generation e-bike. The G4 series brings a new motor, better tires, lighter carbon-fiber components, and more to improve upon what’s already one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21211827/gocycle-gxi-review-price-foldable-electric-bike"&gt;favorite e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. But before you get too excited, know that the G4 range &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; at a suggested retail price of $3,999. The G4, G4i, and G4i Plus models are all available for &lt;a href="https://gocycle.com"&gt;preorder now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyyKZu"&gt;For the money, Gocycle makes a very premium e-bike that we’ve found to be equally suited to long commutes and multimodal travel due to its compact quick-fold design with wide high-volume tires. That tradition continues with the G4 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v39RJk"&gt;The new motor is probably my favorite change and the feature I’m most excited to test. To start, the custom-built G4drive is now billed as “quiet,” bringing it in line with most modern e-bike motors above, say, $1,300. It’s also tuned to power starts from a standstill. Previously, Gocycle relied on thigh power to get you off the line in order to keep the front-hub motor and removable battery as small and lightweight as possible. The G4drive promises more torque and power from what Gocycle still calls a “class-leading compact package.” We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOjX1pmU9ikSYI-XkrdeQkNVdgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407497/Carbon_Fibre_Mid_Frame.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New carbon fiber mid-frame and other improvements help lower the weight on all models by 1kg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rtXKMDm1r-n2SGYBwP0HCrhEazw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407499/Fully_Integrated_Single_Sided_Front_Fork_Houses_New_G4drive_Electric_Motor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New G4drive front-hub motor is quiet, torquier, and able to provide power from a standstill, while the tires have improved grip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MAZdAs"&gt;Even with that stronger motor, other changes like a switch to carbon fiber for the mid-frame and single-sided fork help reduce the weight by 1kg across the series, while treaded tires with an infused silica compound promise better grip. The generation four e-bikes also improve connectivity with an integrated 1 amp USB charging port on the handlebar and Bluetooth LE as well as improved folding and stopping power, according to Gocycle. Three and a half-hour fast charging is now standard across the entire range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFLGa7"&gt;“G4 has been in development for many years and represents the most significant product update for Gocycle since our G1 to G2 engineering programme,” said Gocycle designer and founder Richard Thorpe in a press release. “Our generation four models have been developed through a combination of listening to our customers and our continued mission to develop the best urban electric bikes on the planet. G4 will not only set a new standard for Gocycle, but a new standard for performance for all of our competitors in the portable electric bike segment.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YbehSVZdiaKXYqu3N-t_nNQCnrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407505/Gocycle_G4i__gloss_black_01.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top-of-the-line G4i Plus in gloss black with carbon wheels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PTeKj4"&gt;The G4 (£3,399 / €3,699 / $3,999) is the entry-level model with mechanical twist-shift gears and range up to 40 miles (65 km). The G4i (£3,999 / €4,499 / $4,999) steps things up with predictive electronic shifting, integrated daytime running lights, a more detailed LED dash display, and improved range to 50 miles (80 km). The top-of-the-line G4i Plus (£4,999 / €5,499 / $5,999) model improves things further with lightweight carbon wheels. It will be available in limited numbers in either a bespoke red or gloss black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NfaOzc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10419560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>YouTube has removed Steven Crowder from its Partner Program indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyFxfeZ2NIrOkeCWFoOrlI80dXY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051444/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_4.38.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Steven Crowder’s YouTube channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2G4rWQ"&gt;Two weeks ago, after YouTube revealed its definition of hate speech was so narrow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;that it couldn’t remove a wildly racist tirade&lt;/a&gt; for being wildly racist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22339030/youtube-racist-steven-crowder-video-does-not-violate-hate-speech-policies"&gt;we wondered out loud&lt;/a&gt; what it would take for YouTube to stop promoting conservative commentator Steven Crowder as an official YouTube Partner and allowing him to profit from those tirades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pfv9P"&gt;Today, we have a partial answer: YouTube has officially suspended Steven Crowder’s main channel from the YouTube Partner Program indefinitely, which includes removing his ability to run ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p4gpN"&gt;It’s also banning him from uploading videos for a full week after his latest infraction: a now-removed video that reportedly challenged the legitimacy of the vote in Nevada. YouTube has a policy against false claims that the election was stolen. Crowder &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/steven-crowder/after-being-suspended-youtube-steven-crowder-announces-his-plan-evade-it-his-other"&gt;has already announced his intent&lt;/a&gt; to upload videos to his other Crowder Bits channel, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzpvzm"&gt;Here’s YouTube’s statement (including links):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bac7lX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to monetize on YouTube, channels must comply with the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube Partner Program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which include our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/policies/#community-guidelines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google AdSense program policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Channels that repeatedly violate our policies are suspended from the partner program. In addition, we removed a video from Steven Crowder’s channel for violating our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;presidential election integrity policy &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;and applied a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;strike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, meaning uploads are suspended for one week. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oBnnom"&gt;While YouTube isn’t telling us which straw broke the camel’s back when it comes to the YouTube Partner Program (and his ability to run ads), the company did point us towards two specific guidelines around &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Controversial_sensitive"&gt;controversial issues and sensitive events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Harmful_dangerous"&gt;harmful and dangerous acts&lt;/a&gt;. I would have guessed that awful, racist tirades would have already broken the YouTube Partner Program’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642#Hateful"&gt;hateful and derogatory content&lt;/a&gt; policy, but I guess I shouldn’t read too much into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzc9ck"&gt;It’s not the first time Crowder’s been removed from the YouTube Partner Program. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654196/steven-crowder-demonetized-carlos-maza-youtube-homophobic-language-ads"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;,  it took him &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365601/youtube-steven-crowder-monetization-reinstated-harassment-carlos-maza"&gt;just over a year to come back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is experimenting with hiding dislikes to protect creators’ well-being</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7s4RirOX9iMkRcEc-0mNwnWO-Hc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051226/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CyXNup"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s experimenting with hiding dislikes to discourage “dislike mobs” from deliberately downvoting videos from creators and channels. The experiment is a different implementation than the solutions the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;, but it is similar to other attempts platforms like Instagram have taken to nip targeted attacks in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuDtVC"&gt;In the current setup, stats for both likes and dislikes are viewable in a creator’s individual &lt;a href="http://studio.youtube.com"&gt;YouTube Studio&lt;/a&gt; page, but only likes will be displayed publicly on a video. In &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/104325801?hl=en"&gt;a support article&lt;/a&gt; explaining the test, YouTube says that dislikes can negatively impact a creator’s well-being and “may motivate a targeted campaign of dislikes on a creator’s video.” Basically, the idea is that seeing a dislike number and watching it go up could be enough motivation to join in and make the number larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ngXt4J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;   In response to creator feedback around well-being and targeted dislike campaigns, we're testing a few new designs that don't show the public dislike count. If you're part of this small experiment, you might spot one of these designs in the coming weeks (example below!). &lt;a href="https://t.co/aemrIcnrbx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aemrIcnrbx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube (@YouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942486594150405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shLUNG"&gt;Creators rely on likes and dislikes as a form of feedback to guide their creative output, but much like purposefully giving a game a bad review on Steam, it’s easy to turn what could be a useful feature into another surface for abuse. When YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEdlaJo5YV8"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; it was looking into addressing problems with dislikes, it was considering three ideas: hiding the numbers for both likes and dislikes, adding more friction to disliking something through requiring extra interaction, or removing likes and dislikes entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUsbYC"&gt;This test does half of what the first option promised, and it makes a certain amount of sense. If dislike numbers are the problem, why not just hide them and see what happens? Instagram experimented with a similar kind of test when it decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20956091/instagram-testing-hiding-likes-us-bullying-mosseri"&gt;to hide likes on posts&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, likes are inherently positive, but chasing a high like count can have its own negative impact on creators whose livelihoods depend on closely monitoring interactions with their posts and appearing well-liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmd8t8"&gt;YouTube isn’t testing hiding dislikes on all creators’ videos, but if you notice them on your page or you have an opinion as a viewer, &lt;a href="http://yt.be/help/feedback"&gt;YouTube is collecting feedback&lt;/a&gt; on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is letting Qualcomm off the hook with a tortured statement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ftc-flickr" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBCyrlNcxR26iLASgfvpMg70YdU=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051125/ftc.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PSmf5E"&gt;Four years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/17/14302932/qualcomm-ftc-lawsuit-anticompetitive-practices-modems"&gt;accusing Qualcomm of abusing monopoly power&lt;/a&gt; to charge phone makers additional licensing fees for its modems — and seven months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;seemingly losing that battle&lt;/a&gt; in a federal circuit court — the Federal Trade Commission has decided to throw in the towel. It’s no longer planning to appeal to the Supreme Court, which means the case is done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05c00M"&gt;If that were all, I probably wouldn’t be writing it up for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; since things are exactly where we left off in August.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But then I saw &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/statement-acting-chairwoman-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-agencys"&gt;the FTC’s explanation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it’s dropping the case, and... well, just read it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aPzGcv"&gt;Given the significant headwinds facing the Commission in this matter, the FTC will not petition the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in &lt;em&gt;FTC v. Qualcomm&lt;/em&gt;. The FTC’s staff did an exceptional job presenting the case, and I continue to believe that the district court’s conclusion that Qualcomm violated the antitrust laws was entirely correct and that the court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise. Now more than ever, the FTC and other law enforcement agencies need to boldly enforce the antitrust laws to guard against abusive behavior by dominant firms, including in high-technology markets and those that involve intellectual property. I am particularly concerned about the potential for anticompetitive or unfair behavior in the context of standard setting and the FTC will closely monitor conduct in this arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yeNDk4"&gt;Let me get this straight: the FTC believes it was right about this case, believes it was important, believes that “now more than ever” it needs to “boldly enforce the antitrust laws” and is “particularly concerned” about cases like this... and yet, it’s not even taking the step of seeing whether the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case because of “significant headwinds”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqlS7U"&gt;Perhaps the FTC has bigger fish to fry right now, or perhaps it’s afraid it will simply lose again. It’s not cheap to petition the Supreme Court, after all; in 2013, a lawyer who’s done it repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2013/03/25/how-much-does-big-supreme-court-case-gay-marriage-cost/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a petition can easily cost a quarter of a million dollars. Or perhaps the FTC’s acting chair simply doesn’t think a vote to petition the Supreme Court would pass, given the current staffing split between two Republican and two Democratic FTC commissioners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ATVieZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The weak FTC might be getting stronger, though&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOmlHW"&gt;But the FTC’s tortured public statement doesn’t say those things. It feels a little more like a cry for help from America’s antitrust enforcer, an enforcer &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/its-ridiculous-underfunded-us-regulators"&gt;with a budget that’s admittedly less than $350 million a year&lt;/a&gt; and an enforcer that’s repeatedly let big tech companies go with a slap on the wrist — such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/9/5/20850287/youtube-ftc-settlement-google-antitrust-investigation"&gt;fining Google roughly 37 hours worth of profit&lt;/a&gt; for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) with YouTube or issuing a record-breaking $5 billion fine to Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692524/facebook-five-billion-ftc-fine-embarrassing-joke"&gt;that was so weak, Facebook’s stock price actually went up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYKF4u"&gt;There are signs the FTC might possibly change in meaningful ways, and my colleague Makena Kelly has written about them at length, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346828/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-biden-nomination-facebook-google-doj-garland"&gt;Congress potentially modifying the law&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to bring lawsuits against Big Tech, and the strong possibility that influential antitrust scholar Lina Khan may soon help run the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22321092/lina-khan-ftc-tech-antitrust-law-regulation-amazon"&gt;with President Biden’s nomination&lt;/a&gt;. In the meanwhile, the agency that believes Qualcomm has a monopoly — the agency we expect to bust such a monopoly if so — is just going to let this one go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen of America lied about rebranding to ‘Voltswagen’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VMZw1oqsursZ1FT2ZyxUpONW9c4=/0x120:716x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69048185/Large_13212_VoltswagenAnewnameforaneweraofe_Mobility.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Volkswagen of America&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TmfqQn"&gt;Volkswagen of America lied about rebranding to “Voltswagen” in an effort to draw attention to the lone electric vehicle it’s currently selling in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-name/volkswagen-will-not-change-name-of-u-s-operations-sources-idUSKBN2BM2YJ?il=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/messaging-says-vw-usa-to-rebrand-itself-voltswagenheadquarters-says-not-so-fast-11617120111?mod=hp_lead_pos10"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported. It was a marketing stunt done ahead of April Fools’ Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7ysfi"&gt;This all started when Volkswagen of America “accidentally” published a draft version of a press release announcing the change on Monday, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html"&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The company had declined to comment on the report, and spokesperson Mark Gillies repeatedly declined to say whether the name change was a marketing stunt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LxBGN"&gt;The automaker, which pleaded guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/volkswagen-ag-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-43-billion-criminal-and-civil-penalties-six"&gt;deceiving regulators about the true pollution levels of hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, then published a press release on Tuesday morning saying the change was a “public declaration of the company’s future-forward investment in e-mobility.” The company said the “Voltswagen” branding would be on all of its EVs going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO32eV"&gt;Volkswagen of America is now expected to reveal on Wednesday that the name change was a stunt, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. The larger Volkswagen Group declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NnCSU"&gt;“We have said, from the beginning of our shift to an electric future, that we will build EVs for the millions, not just millionaires,” CEO of Volkswagen of America Scott Keogh proudly boasted in the press release, which, at publication time, &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1499"&gt;remained on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;. “This name change signifies a nod to our past as the peoples’ car and our firm belief that our future is in being the peoples’ electric car.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AE6fDQLltVgeB9ClhH0fxLt5B5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408979/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_3.53.57_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="reM8p8"&gt;Volkswagen’s various social media accounts also promoted the lie on Tuesday. The @VW account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VW/status/1376868756782219266"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; an image of the fake “Voltswagen” logo and wrote “66 is an unusual age to change your name.” That’s a nod to the age of the American subsidiary — not the larger Volkswagen Group, which was founded in the 1930s before it became part of the Nazi war machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6xeuM"&gt;Volkswagen of America so straightforwardly represented the name change as real that it was reported by &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, the BBC, and dozens of other outlets, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Even Wall Street firm Wedbush &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Finvesting%2Fvolkswagen-closer-to-apple-partnership-wedbush-says&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22357166%2Fvolkswagen-name-change-voltswagen-us-division" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published a note about the change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySYCqQ"&gt;Volkswagen is at the beginning of an $86 billion push into electric vehicles because it wants to be known as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; leader in the space — a strategic shift that, again, was inspired by the fact that the company was caught installing software on its vehicles that was meant to fool regulators into allowing dirty cars on the road. It did not seem completely out of the question that the company would be willing to make such a ridiculous choice; after all, Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess has spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/20/22240725/volkswagen-herbert-diess-twitter-elon-musk-vw-tesla"&gt;emulating&lt;/a&gt; Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, who makes erratic decisions like most people drink water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3ATmi"&gt;But now we know the rebrand was nothing more than another lie from a company that’s become known for something else: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352646/volkswagen-dieselgate-investigation-damages-winterkorn-audi"&gt;lying&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnQlaz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 30th, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This post was originally written about Volkswagen’s announcement that it was rebranding in the US to “Voltswagen.” The company has since confirmed that this was a lie in service of a marketing stunt. The post and headline have been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wFRdw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube denies employee request to remove rap song with anti-Chinese lyrics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGczVJldUO-M8w3RSFlobXcCW5I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69050807/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfs8IO"&gt;YouTube is facing employee calls to remove a rap song that allegedly encourages violence against Asians, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/youtube-refuses-to-remove-anti-asian-song-drawing-staff-ire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcEwIU"&gt;Rapper YG’s “Meet the Flockers” is a detailed description of a burglary — a relatively common trope in rap music — but it opens with a specific reference to Chinese communities: “find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don’t believe in bank accounts.” In light of the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22274325/asians-racism-coronavirus-oakland-san-francisco"&gt;recent rise in street violence against Asians&lt;/a&gt;, a group of YouTube employees argued that message was straightforwardly dangerous, ultimately asking the Trust &amp;amp; Safety team to remove the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBEA0v"&gt;But YouTube ultimately declined to remove the song, citing &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/"&gt;the platform’s exception&lt;/a&gt; for “educational, documentary, scientific, and artistic” (or EDSA) content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGerpX"&gt;“While EDSA is not a free pass for any content, there are likely thousands of music videos that would otherwise violate policies... were it not for these sorts of EDSA exceptions,” executives wrote in an open letter to employees. “Removing this video would have far-reaching implications for other musical content containing similarly violent or offensive lyrics, in genres ranging from rap to rock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqbIY1"&gt;It’s not the first time “Meet the Flockers” has generated controversy. Largely ignored on its release in 2014, the song became &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/yg-meet-the-flockers-controversy"&gt;a point of controversy for Chinese communities two years later&lt;/a&gt; after circulating in social media channels, with &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/yg-meet-the-flockers-knock-burglaries/1958131/"&gt;some police departments&lt;/a&gt; even blaming the song and a subsequent unauthorized music video for specific home burglaries. Concern became so heated that &lt;a href="http://sfist.com/2016/09/28/jane_kim_wants_youtube_to_remove_an.php"&gt;San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim&lt;/a&gt; called on YouTube to remove the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxa5wi"&gt;YouTube also declined to take action in response to the 2016 controversy, although the uploader later voluntarily removed the music video. The song remains on YouTube through the official YG account, played over a static album cover image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8gcMQ"&gt;Reached for comment, YouTube emphasized the importance of open disagreement within its workforce. “YouTube has an open culture and employees are encouraged to to share their views, even when they disagree with a decision,” a representative said. “We’ll continue this dialogue as part of our ongoing work to balance openness with protecting the YouTube community at large.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcyPeq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4DWj4R"&gt;Apple’s built-in web content filter for iOS and macOS has apparently been blocking any searches containing the word “Asian” for almost a year, and the error is finally getting fixed, according to a &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-asian-adult-content-filter-ios-fix/"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The issue shows up when you’re using a device that has the “Limit Adult Websites” content restriction turned on. But it’s not just blocking adult websites; it’s blocking almost any searches relating to Asian culture, including “Asian market,” “Asian culture,” and even “stop Asian hate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4HQNl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to confirm that the above searches were blocked on devices running current versions of Apple’s software (iPadOS 14.4.1 and macOS 11.2.3) with the content restrictions turned on. The searches are blocked on both Safari and Chrome on iOS devices, but Chrome was able to perform them on macOS. Devices without the content restrictions turned on can perform the searches and receive results. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nnBi-paaXCSm7De5vPXKvZYOqZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408688/IMG_A6361A17FF98_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message shown when a search is blocked by the content restrictions on an iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzBuf2"&gt;The good news is that the issue should soon be resolved. The searches work on devices running the iOS 14.5 beta, &lt;em&gt;Mashable &lt;/em&gt;reports. Still, it’s ridiculous that it took this long to fix: there are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charliestigler/status/1229845987864109056"&gt;reports of the issue&lt;/a&gt; from February 2020, and it shouldn’t have been an issue in the first place. Of course, creating a filter for adult content is extremely difficult, but almost entirely blocking a word used to describe &lt;a href="https://asiapacific.unfpa.org/en/node/15207"&gt;60 percent of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is obviously incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35eD3x"&gt;In current, non-beta software, the filter behaves very strangely. “Asian restaurants” is blocked on macOS but not iOS, while “Asian food” is blocked on both. And while the issue has been around for a while, it’s especially embarrassing for Apple in the current moment, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"&gt;anti-Asian sentiment and violence have been on the rise&lt;/a&gt;. It’s good to see it should be solved in the next versions of iOS, but it shouldn’t have taken this long. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVd9u16rXqTZwykb9t8sVIxO1dM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67799392/acastro_201109_4282_gamingHeadsets_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few options for each platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZkrThV"&gt;If you’re shopping for a gaming headset, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of options. While there are some great ones out there, it’s easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn’t work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that’s just uncomfortable. Knowing a thing or two about headphones &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIb46"&gt;For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate without a dongle via Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol. They’ll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases. Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless dongle, it’ll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console’s TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox. It’s best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly, or else there’s a good chance you’ll run into some compatibility issues. Of course, you can eliminate most of the guesswork by buying a wired gaming headset instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JNU3"&gt;This guide focuses on newer options that you’re more likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online. Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKGdzA"&gt;You’ll find a few categories below, including the &lt;strong&gt;best multiplatform wireless headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock, the &lt;strong&gt;best Xbox wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;best wired gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="McEjqN"&gt;Best multiplatform wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QxhUUV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sxpL6zcXsuLE6hAiQUeioEP8vfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973780/cfaulkner_201016_4245_0001.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="riIMhm"&gt;The HyperX Cloud II Wireless makes an excellent first impression before even turning it on for the first time. Its headband expands to fit a range of head sizes, and the ear cups rest gently around my ears without nary a pinching feeling around my cranium. The cups can be stretched even further than my head requires, which gives me faith that they’ll be a durable pick for years to come. This is the downfall of many otherwise good gaming headsets. HyperX nailed the fit, and it also aced a lot of other winning elements with the Cloud II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7HwnV"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless boasts a balanced sound that delivers just enough gusto for every scenario. It’s not the right choice if you want bass to rattle your head, but it’s good if you want your headset to be just as enjoyable to use for gaming as it is for music and voice chats. I also like that the Cloud II Wireless has USB-C charging, and its battery life is long-lasting. HyperX claims 30 hours of battery per charge, and the headset lived up to that mark during my testing. The wireless range of the headset and the included 2.4GHz wireless receiver are also great, suffering no drops anywhere in my apartment. It even remained stable when I stood on the other side of a wall or window, each being about 25 feet away from the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7a8Vev"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: The Cloud II Wireless seems to be out of stock at most retailers that sell it. As for which headset makes for a suitable alternative if you need to buy now, people looking for comfort above all else should check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech’s G733&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. For a headset that closely matches its features, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723931742397286408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro A20 Gen 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; below should satisfy you.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iHCKN5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568047" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlqrJU"&gt;Compared to competitors in this price range, the Cloud II plays it simple when it comes to the buttons, and the result is that it’s easy to learn how to master the layout. And if all the functions you require are a volume dial, power button, and a microphone mute button, this will suit you better than other headsets that try to fit too many buttons onto ear cups. On the other hand, it’s missing a game and chat audio mix dial that easily lets you fine-tune your game audio with your pals chatting on Discord or while streaming. You can do this manually by clicking a few windows, but other headsets mentioned below make this easier to do. This headset also makes it easy to turn on mic monitoring to hear yourself talk (and hear things happening around you) by simply holding the mute button to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQCvSA"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless doesn’t have an overwhelming lead over the major players in the space, like Logitech, SteelSeries, and Razer. In fact, it may get the boot if a similarly priced and comparably cozy model with wired 3.5mm connectivity and Bluetooth support comes along. But since that has yet to happen, HyperX’s flagship wireless headset is the easy choice for PC, PlayStation, and Switch gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQibPD"&gt;Here’s what the microphone sounds like on the HyperX Cloud II Wireless:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YdssKP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DSU9zw"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21404415/astro-a20-gen-2-next-gen-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-wireless-headset"&gt;Astro A20 Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; ($120)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiplatform but requires an extra $20 adapter to work with both PS and Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMAE19hTSmz0CsTc9TF32Tv1bnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21830232/Aquarius_Blue_Desk_Stage_2_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SrrIBJ"&gt;Astro’s new A20 for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles is unique in that it’s one of the few cross-platform wireless headsets out there. Buying just one of them (in either the PlayStation blue / white colorway or the Xbox green / white) can let you connect to either system. However, there’s a small catch: you’ll need to buy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional $20 wireless adapter&lt;/a&gt; to let it connect to the console opposite of your headset’s color styling (each headset includes one adapter). Despite the string attached, this functionality makes it an appealing option for people who will be getting both the PS5 and Xbox Series X or S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntDrFp"&gt;Whichever platform you’ll use with this headset, Astro’s A20 Gen 2 is packed with more buttons and features than the Cloud II Wireless above. On the ear cups, Astro managed to also fit in a dedicated button for switching the equalizer to your liking to add or subtract bass and vocal clarity. There’s also a game and chat audio mixing dial to help you find the right balance of sounds between your apps. I love this feature, and I also dig that it has a good amount of mic monitoring, so you can hear a little bit of the outside world. This headset’s microphone doesn’t detach. Instead, you’ll just move it up to mute it, which gets it out of your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4o0BxC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j1b0Ap"&gt;Astro’s latest headset checks a lot of boxes considering its $120 price. The A20 Gen 2 doesn’t quite reach the comfort of HyperX’s model above, as it hangs most of its weight at the top of your head. It doesn’t get painful as the ear cups don’t pinch, but it can result in some fatigue after a while (on top of some very bad headset hair). Also, while I appreciated the EQ button that cycles between sound profiles, the sound quality on the whole isn’t as balanced and punchy as the Cloud II Wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpjga"&gt;But speaking on its features alone, it’s a more affordable runner-up choice if you want better console compatibility (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even though it comes at a $20 cost&lt;/a&gt; to have both Xbox and PlayStation support), and a headset that has a physical game and chat mixing dial. I found the wireless range of the A20 Gen 2 and its included wireless receiver to be quite good. My studio apartment is about 40 feet long and 15 feet wide, the headset kept a solid connection throughout. I was even able to run some trash outside without a drop. Astro claims up to 15 meters of range.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C dongle that ships with the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless makes it an alluring choice for Switch gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyHuQL"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="H0bxb3"&gt;The amount of wireless gaming headsets is blossoming, and I expect to make an update to this section on a regular basis — perhaps more regularly than the sections below. As such, there are plenty of other options that didn’t quite make the cut as the “best” but are still pretty good in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1RkbU"&gt;Logitech’s G733 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$127&lt;/a&gt;) came very close to being the runner-up headset. It’s comfortable with breathable ear cups, it has good sound for the price, and the vertical strips of LEDs actually look sharp. It misses the mark by not allowing a wired listening mode and for not having a game-chat audio mix dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJyiFA"&gt;The G Pro X Lightspeed (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081PP4CB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=19e702d2b62186465b570dcca369fd9f&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200&lt;/a&gt;), also from Logitech, nails the basics of having good build quality, USB-C charging, and punchy sound quality. It goes a step beyond the G733 with better noise isolation. However, its heavy build wore uncomfortably on my head after a few hours and I don’t think it offers enough features to justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5uWQ"&gt;The Audeze Penrose (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Wireless-Playstation-Low-Latency-Bluetooth/dp/B08D9PBR9X?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=6e608f6933710a8443e333369413294a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299&lt;/a&gt;) has incredible sound quality, along with a plethora of features, like Bluetooth support for connecting a phone and console simultaneously, USB-C for charging, and a 3.5mm port for wired listening. However, considering its high price, it’s not nearly comfortable enough for my head size — it is heavy and too tight — and I think it is likely to wear heavily on other heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgokdG"&gt;If you’re mostly into playing games on the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 1 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best choices out there when it comes to ease of use. It isn’t a super comfortable headset, as it lacks the company’s ski band-style headband that distributes weight gently on your head. But it ships with a USB-C wireless receiver that can plug directly into the Switch or Switch Lite. Connectivity is strong, and audio quality is quite good given the headset’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X64MTGL?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=cfbb36f4c557294387d3902c446fc9a1&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kVCQQA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j1QvYC"&gt;Best Xbox-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9eHTCI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Bluetooth-ready devices, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T3InI_Jx1ABKPuq9tgDd-BkhyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363682/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BF4Nbd"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset is surprisingly good for $100. It has all of the same features as our previous top pick, Razer’s Kaira Pro, but knocks $50 off the price and has a better design. Like the Surface Headphones, this headset features twistable dials on the outside of its earcups, and it simplifies making quick adjustments, like turning up the volume on the right side, or tweaking the game / chat audio mix on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrpptY"&gt;This headset operates on the Xbox Wireless protocol, letting it connect effortlessly to a modern Xbox console with a push of its pairing button (it pairs just like a controller). It supports a concurrent Bluetooth connection, too, so you can be paired to your phone and console at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTAiuF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: it’s tough to find the Xbox Wireless headset in stock currently. Best Buy is the first place you should look for restocks. If you have to get a headset now, the best alternative is the runner-up below, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LRV49W8?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=eaf86b6a935186a1ebd412c822bc4cc5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Kaira Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LIHpB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv7vfB"&gt;Battery life is fine, but not spectacular at around 15 hours per charge. While I really like the Bluetooth feature, this headset lacks a multifunction button for controlling, say, phone calls or playing / pausing music or podcasts coming from your phone or tablet that might be connected. Razer’s Kaira Pro makes this easier. Another fault is that this model lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that might not be a big deal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYmful"&gt;Microsoft’s headset doesn’t break new ground, it just does a lot right for a reasonable price. There are other options that offer noise cancellation and more hearty sound quality than this model. But if you don’t want to spend more than $100, most people should be very happy with what the Xbox Wireless headset offers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="66Orpz"&gt;Razer’s new Kaira Pro for Xbox consoles and PC is one of the company’s most impressive headsets yet. It narrowly loses the matchup to the HS75 XB listed below when it comes to sound quality, but it leaps ahead with more features. It includes the option to connect to devices via Bluetooth so you can listen to music, podcasts, or take calls while you game on Xbox or PC. The Kaira Pro also has other features I expect to have in a wireless gaming headset, like USB-C charging and a handy game and chat dial for a customized audio mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXqF7"&gt;A particularly cool feature here are the built-in microphones that kick in when you’re connected to a device over Bluetooth. While the Kaira Pro includes a detachable boom mic for use with gaming on your console, these additional microphones are useful for on-the-go voice calls when you don’t want to be seen using the bigger microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hIYdw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568243" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtxXA"&gt;As I mentioned before, the Kaira Pro sounds great, but it’s not quite as robust when put up against the Corsair model below. If you’re a stickler for crisp sound quality and better positional audio, opt for the runner-up since they’re open-back and not closed like Razer’s headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEhXsi"&gt;Razer’s headset looks and fits mostly like your average set of over-ear headphones, which is ideal since you can easily use it in that fashion with its Bluetooth function. The Kaira Pro’s build quality is better than I expected, particularly when it comes to comfort. It places equal pressure on the top of your head and around your ears, feeling just tight enough to keep the sound in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnqkBI"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Razer Kaira Pro sounds like:

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="orJF4d"&gt;If you’re locked to team Xbox, or find yourself switching between PC (with Microsoft’s Xbox wireless adapter) and your console, Corsair’s HS75 XB Wireless is currently the headset that I recommend if you want superb audio quality. It’s a $150 model that surprised me with impressive sound and a styling that looks like a set of premium open-back headphones. In addition to a bombastic sound that, at least for a moment, made me forget that I wasn’t using my Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless headphones, it’s comfortable to wear for hours. These look far heavier in images than they feel on my head, and I was delighted that they didn’t give off much of a pinching sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGpDXo"&gt;It’s usually the small details that win me over in a headset, and in the HS75 XB, it’s the symmetrical button layout. Thus, the learning curve for mastering the buttons is low, and this model has everything I need in a pinch, including a game and chat audio dial, volume dial, and an easy way to mute the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7H0E2q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568253" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obhus1"&gt;Corsair’s 20-hour battery life claims for the HS75 XB are a tad lower than competing models. But its USB-C charging at least makes recharging faster and more simple to do than plugging in via Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN4Uu"&gt;I mentioned this with the Razer Kaira Pro, but wireless range is an issue here. Your living arrangement might yield different results, but breaking line of sight with the Xbox Wireless Adapter plugged into my PC or straying more than 15 or so feet away made the audio begin to crackle. I think I’d prefer if Corsair simply made its own dongle that was compatible with Xbox than going this route. Still, this is a great headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OkJraT"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Corsair HS75 XB Wireless sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ix1BVV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BO7lTo"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ySUxNR"&gt;The options above deliver the best experience for the money, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other solid options out there. We tested other wireless gaming headsets from manufacturers like Turtle Beach and LucidSound. Though, there was usually one or more deal-breakers about each model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rOlW"&gt;For instance, the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Premium-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Console/dp/B08D45WDR7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=89ece5e076095169f2188aa3e8230262&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) sounds great and has USB-C charging, but its fit is tight and it’s uncomfortable to wear after a while. Your experience may vary depending on your head size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9V3HE"&gt;The LucidSound LS15X (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MMSW147/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=83aa2896b7a6f9de3c8cac25250149e1&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$86&lt;/a&gt;) and SteelSeries Arctis 7X Wireless (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7x&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) are also good in some ways, but not good enough that I suggest you seek them out over the others above. Both offer better comfort than the Stealth 700 Gen 2, but they’re relatively light on extra features and they charge via Micro USB, which is just inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fD8Ib3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NvDGre"&gt;Best PlayStation-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731191871792355944" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Pulse 3D&lt;/a&gt; ($100)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nz0scw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PS5, PS4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony Pulse 3D headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOf5ce2ocE5G4xWmRzB8Os1tqq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276836/pulse3d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony Pulse 3D gaming headset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KWlvfW"&gt;Sony’s $99 Pulse 3D wireless headset for the PS4 and PS5 is a surprisingly feature-packed headset that’s also one of the most comfortable options on this list. I’m a sucker for well-fitting headsets, and the bungie-style headband Sony supplies is fantastic. Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band. It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it’s on my head. Just a note: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avxDnB"&gt;The Pulse 3D’s headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5’s Tempest sound engine. Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off. Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5’s &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; to be a great showcase for it. In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear. For a more relaxing experience, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; sounds great, too. There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems. Games that don’t support 3D audio still sound good but are not quite as enthralling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcK8B"&gt;For a $99 headset, the positional audio quality is better than I expected, as is the sound balance. There’s not an overwhelming amount of bass or tinny highs — everything is delivered delicately. I like that because it helps prevent fatigue during long play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="63qvPj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbTnpB"&gt;Almost everything else about this headset is impressive for the price as well. The controls are a little more intuitively laid-out than Sony’s previous model for the PS4. The Pulse 3D features a tactile rocker that lets you balance game audio with your chat, and there are separate buttons just for adjusting volume. I like that there’s a dedicated switch for turning on mic monitoring, which helps to funnel in just a little bit of outside sound (including your own voice) through its built-in pinhole microphones, so you’re not totally isolated while wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiOAWK"&gt;Speaking of mic quality, these kinds of mics are certainly not as good as what you’d get with most boom microphones. For instance, some “s” and “f” sounds are often muddled. But on the whole, it’s serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHWw0L"&gt;The Pulse 3D supports listening via an included 3.5mm cable or wirelessly when paired up to the 2.4GHz receiver. What’s new here is support for USB-C charging. Sony is by no means the only company putting USB-C in headsets these days, but it’s nevertheless nice to use the same cord that charges your DualSense to recharge this headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb182h"&gt;Sony claims 13 hours of wireless performance per charge. The headset actually landed between about 10 and 12 hours during my testing, which is an underwhelming result. Of course, this is less of an issue if you’re connecting it to a power source each time you stop gaming for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uWo9Sy"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II gaming headset offers the most features, but at the highest cost of any other headset featured in this guide. Despite costing more than an Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch, this set delivers on value. It comes with the QC 35 II wireless noise-canceling headphones that can be used on the go with Bluetooth and wired 3.5mm connectivity. There are no other options I’ve listed that have a noise cancellation feature and support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also among the most comfortable, lightweight options on this list. You’ll know when the QC 35 II is on your head, but it doesn’t pinch or press hard against your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRyE2r"&gt;Used as a gaming headset, either connected via USB through its included desktop controller or via 3.5mm, the QC 35 II makes for a lightweight, comfortable option with a microphone attachment that’s easy to use. This model offers the best noise isolation (even without the battery-draining noise cancellation feature switched on) in any headset I’ve tested. Noise isolation is usually something most headsets fumble, but with this one you’ll be able to better hear footsteps and other crucial noises that might decide the match. With noise cancellation switched on, it really does make everything around you very quiet — perfect for boosting the immersion in your games. The desktop controller I mentioned above adds more features, including a nice volume dial and button that adjusts the intensity of mic monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtgrRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ZNt7"&gt;The $329 price is high, but if you value noise cancellation and want to have a headset you can easily take on the road (and that has ear cups that can swivel and fold into a compact size), check this out. It’s worth noting that current owners of the QC 35 II headphones unfortunately won’t be able to easily acquire the microphone attachment, as Bose isn’t selling it separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b6Zsn5"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Bose QC 35 II gaming headset sounds like:

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U8pXiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ejvb7t"&gt;Razer’s updated BlackShark headset is my runner-up choice for a wired headset you can buy. It’s $100, yet it features a similar design and general feature set to Razer’s $200 wireless V2 Pro model. That also means it’s just as comfortable, with a plush headband and breathable ear cups that don’t apply too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOPElj"&gt;This model’s build materials are a step above the $59 BlackShark V2 X when it comes to being breathable, and it includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;USB sound card&lt;/a&gt;, into which the headset’s 3.5mm end plugs. With it, you’ll get slightly better sound quality. Also, using the sound card allows you to use THX spatial sound in Razer’s Synapse 3 software, which I found to be a nice value add but not particularly alluring in practice. Razer says it’s adding spatial audio profiles for popular games moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of ways to utilize the sound card, if this feature strikes your interest. Regardless of your interest, you’ll also be able to plug the headset’s 3.5mm end into a variety of controllers and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gz2EXW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568257" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgFwUw"&gt;Something that stood out to me during testing is that finding a comfortable fit took almost no effort. And while many headsets are comfortable enough to wear for hours, I didn’t want to take the BlackShark V2 off my head. Another nice touch is its volume knob, which affords fine-tune adjustments that dials don’t usually provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SMekMu"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the BlackShark V2 sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TY1VFp"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ryiJOs"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXkzte"&gt;If you’re committed to getting a wired headset, there are some really interesting options out there. I got to test a few other headsets that, while not as good as the models above, might be better for your needs or budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIgFJ"&gt;For something less expensive than Bose’s headset that still sounds good, HyperX’s Cloud Revolver 7.1 wired headset for a PC (&lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets/cloud-revolver-gaming-headset"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) might be worth checking out, particularly if you’re looking for something comfortable. This model is just as comfy to wear as the Cloud II Wireless, my top wireless pick at the top of this article. Sound quality isn’t at the same level, though, and I’d recommend holding off on any purchases until the price drops, as the package here is fairly light on features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Uaxxs"&gt;Creative Audio’s SXFI Gamer (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNPSZVP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=d134f5aa0a291f3f43cb53e066c7546d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130&lt;/a&gt;) is a USB-C wired headset that has a simple design and a sound profile that’s pleasant to listen to for games, voice chat, or music. My complaints with this one are on the minor side, with its sizing adjustments not holding very well and its voice prompts sometimes being confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QJEfi2"&gt;The Sennheiser EPOS 601 (&lt;a href="https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/gaming/products/gsp-601-gaming-headset-1000413"&gt;$220&lt;/a&gt;) nails the fundamentals, with great sound and a quality microphone. But the ear cups are too darn big, and that excess spills into its overall design. It’s also too expensive for a relatively basic wired headset that doesn’t offer but a couple of special features, like replaceable sidearm plates and a twist-to-adjust volume knob.&lt;/p&gt;
