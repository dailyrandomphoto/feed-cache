    <title>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says Starlink internet service leaving beta in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9nRkDP"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438748063527575555"&gt;tweeted Friday&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s Starlink satellite internet network would come out of its open beta phase next month. That’s two months later than the August date &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556031/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-users-next-year-telecom-5g"&gt;Musk gave at Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt;, when he also said he expected the service to have “possibly over 500,000 users within 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6N9On"&gt;The Starlink system calls for a constellation of nearly 12,000 satellites in low-Earth orbits that will beam continuous broadband internet service. A terminal costs $499 and there’s a $99 monthly fee for service. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;opened its public beta&lt;/a&gt; test in October 2020, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1429907171639103489?s=20"&gt;Musk said in August&lt;/a&gt; that SpaceX had shipped 100,000 Starlink terminals, which includes a satellite dish and a Wi-Fi router, to users in 14 countries. As the beta ends and more countries are able to get access to Starlink, that 100,000 number is likely to grow, although it’s hard to tell when it might reach the half-million mark that Musk predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37tpFT"&gt;Starlink’s internet service is planned to be sold directly to consumers in rural areas around the world, among other customers, and it’s touting 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds. Reviews of the Starlink service so far have been mixed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="90BfTO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Starlink review: broadband dreams fall to Earth","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Jm49aE"&gt;It’s also worth noting that Musk tends to be extremely optimistic when laying out deadlines for his companies’ product releases, as Tesla customers who waited for that company’s so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563751/tesla-elon-musk-full-self-driving-admission-autopilot-crash"&gt;“Full Self Driving” software&lt;/a&gt; can attest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson’s stunning vintage-inspired electric bikes are going on sale later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylbGEaWQIsmXszY92FPZ3OoWiQ0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876882/S1_Tribute_Front_Right.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zH6ULH"&gt;Nearly a year after announcing plans to spin out its own electric bike company called Serial 1, Harley-Davidson said it will sell a “limited” number of the gorgeous, vintage-inspired models that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;originally said was just a “styling exercise.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGjXts"&gt;The S1 Mosh/Tribute is an homage to &lt;a href="https://ultimatemotorcycling.com/2010/03/09/1903_harley-davidson_serial_number_one/"&gt;“Serial Number One,”&lt;/a&gt; the nickname for Harley-Davidson’s oldest known motorcycle built in 1903. The bike’s design, with its white tires, leather saddle and handgrips, and sleek black frame with gold lettering, harken back to that first prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMO0An"&gt;But under the glossy black paint and honey-colored leather accents, the bike is identical to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564315/harley-davidson-ebikes-serial-1-price-specs-date"&gt;Serial 1’s entry-level Mosh/Cty model&lt;/a&gt;. The S1 Mosh/Tribute (props to Harley for keeping all the vowels this time ) has many of the same features as the Mosh/Cty, including a Gates Carbon Drive belt, Brose mid-drive motor, TRP hydraulic disc brakes, internally routed cables and wires, and integrated lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="04zusU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the company is leaning into its motorcycle roots by relying on exclusives and one-offs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nSsEzd"&gt;The white-toned Schwalbe Super Moto-X tires are exclusive to Serial 1, and the leather saddle and matching leather grips are hand-made from Brooks England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkg2u7"&gt;It’s an update that’s sure to delight many potential customers who were initially disappointed when Harley-Davidson declined to say whether it would put the prototype into production back in October 2020. But it’s also an indication that the company is leaning into its motorcycle roots by relying on exclusive one-offs and limited runs as it tries to build a brand identity in what is turning out to be an incredibly crowded and competitive space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="STOlMs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10759201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrGOHj"&gt;Last month, the company announced a series of exclusive, one-of-a-kind e-bikes that it was auctioning off under its 1-OFF series brand name, with the Schwinn Sting-Ray-inspired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616558/harley-davidson-seral-1-electric-chopper-auction-specs"&gt;Mosh/Chopper as the first offering&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.serial1.com%2Fproduct%2Fmosh-chopper%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F18%2F22679256%2Fharley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-s1-mosh-tribute-exclusive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The winning bid was $14,200&lt;/a&gt;, which... wow.) At the time, the company said that much like in the motorcycle world, customization and personalization would play a big role in how Serial 1 thinks about the types of e-bikes it designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JettMu"&gt;The S1 Mosh/Tribute will serve as a “springboard to launch our S1 Series that will see even more exclusive and highly-desirable Serial 1 eBike models in the future,” product manager Aaron Frank said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUrJY8"&gt;Harley-Davidson said it will only make 650 units, half of which will be available for purchase in the US, and the other half in Europe. Interested customers can pre-order one starting today on the company’s website, and deliveries are expected to commence in the fourth quarter of this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook VP disputes report claiming the platform knows about multiple flaws it doesn’t fix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OattcqRglK8jz1Iw9MxyVNDAOFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876762/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dc0VwI"&gt;Facebook’s vice president of global affairs criticized a series of stories by the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; that reported the social network is aware of numerous problems across its platforms that cause harm to users, but does little to fix them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBJeWg"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/"&gt;post on Facebook’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Clegg wrote that while it was “absolutely legitimate for us to be held to account for how we deal with” some of the issues outlined in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporting, the stories “contained deliberate mischaracterizations of what we are trying to do, and conferred egregiously false motives to Facebook’s leadership and employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QY7VNv"&gt;This week, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; published a sweeping series of deeply reported stories on Facebook, based on its review of internal documents, concluding that the company’s platforms “are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO7wak"&gt;The stories included details about the XCheck program that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; found exempts celebrities from Facebook’s standard moderation rules; a look at internal research that shows its photo platform Instagram is problematic for younger users’ mental health; how changes Facebook made to its algorithm increased engagement but actually made users more angry; a look at employees’ concerns about how its platforms may be used in human trafficking, and how CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s initiative to promote COVID-19 vaccines drew anti-vax activists to flood Facebook with “barrier to vaccination” content. You can read the full &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files series here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsqHyr"&gt;Two Senators on the Commerce Committee panel that oversees consumer protection said they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;launching an investigation&lt;/a&gt; following the&lt;em&gt; Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; report that Facebook was aware that Instagram could be harmful to teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTi2SF"&gt;Clegg said in his blog post that the allegation that “Facebook conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings are inconvenient for the company” was incorrect. “[W]e fundamentally reject this mischaracterization of our work and impugning of the company’s motives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMBEuW"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clive Sinclair, inventor of the ZX Spectrum personal computer, has died</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjr23M"&gt;Clive Sinclair, who invented the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, an early personal computer, died of cancer Thursday at age 81, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58587521"&gt;his family confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. Sinclair was an inventor with an impressive list of electronic products to his name, some, like his pocket calculator, were quite successful, while others, like his Sinclair C5 “electric trike” vehicle, were decidedly not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UISHI8"&gt;Born in England in 1940, Sinclair had a knack for creating gadgets. The Sinclair Executive “slimline” pocket calculator, released in 1972, sold well (likely in large part due to its low price ), and at one point was &lt;a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/2608"&gt;displayed at the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLoJXu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/workspace/pc/tales-tech-history-zx-spectrum-207004"&gt;Sinclair’s ZX personal computers&lt;/a&gt; were priced lower than the then-popular Commodore 64, and well-liked by consumers in the UK. The ZX Spectrum (nicknamed “Speccy”)  had a rubber keyboard and a color display, and eventually a library of thousands of games. The first model had 16KB of RAM and sold for £125 (roughly $170). The ZX Spectrum sold some 5 million units worldwide, before it was discontinued in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OLomJg"&gt;But even many of Sinclair’s less successful inventions were later validated; Sinclair’s Black Watch, which used “integrated circuit technology” according to a &lt;a href="https://rk.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/other/gallery/blackwatch_ukad.jpg"&gt;1970s print ad&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t really catch on, but looks it could have inspired some of the fitness trackers everyone wears on their wrists now. Sinclair’s TV80 pocket television wasn’t popular back in the day, but now we all carry little screens around with us wherever we go. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438623391645372420?"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted his condolences&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, saying he “loved” the ZX Spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSXse9"&gt;The Sinclair C5 electric vehicle, which launched in 1985 with a starting price of around  £399 (roughly $550) wasn’t a hit with consumers either; you had to pedal it when the battery died, and when seated the operator was below the line of sight of most cars on the road. Oh, and there was no passenger seat: the C5 was a one-person vehicle. It’s probably a stretch to call it a precursor to the Tesla, but Sinclair was on to something, perhaps just a few decades ahead of the general public.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ndUEgl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5N937V8ZOw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qnZwn8"&gt;“It was the ideas, the challenge, that he found exciting,” Sinclair’s daughter Belinda said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/16/home-computing-pioneer-sir-clive-sinclair-dies-aged-81"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “He’d come up with an idea and say, ‘There’s no point in asking if someone wants it, because they can’t imagine it.’” And doesn’t that last bit sound a lot like a sentiment often attributed to the late Steve Jobs, about why he didn’t rely on market research for product development: “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRpHG9"&gt;Despite receiving a knighthood in 1983 for his contributions to the UK’s computer industry, and being a pioneer in the field of consumer electronics, Sinclair preferred his slide rule to a calculator. He said he found the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/28/clive-sinclair-interview-simon-garfield"&gt;internet and email “annoying,”&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t use them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iHCpi"&gt;In addition to Belinda, Sinclair is survived by sons Crispin and Bartholomew, five grandchildren and two great grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV at Best Buy this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgS4pyfvxQNptZIAgXccbWC55JA=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876143/153092_tv_review_sony_a8_4k_oled_tv_review_image1_bgco4tcqtp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Slim and sharp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgcRHO"&gt;OLED TVs have developed a reputation for being sharp, clean, fragile, but also remarkably expensive. But this weekend you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzVgpkkUy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save a whopping $800 on this 55-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; from Sony at Best Buy. At just 2.3-inches thick without its stand, the A8H, much like other OLED screens, is impossibly slim. This makes it ideal for wall mounting especially for anyone in pursuit of that ultra-clean, Ikea catalog aesthetic. In terms of apps, the A8H has access to the Android TV catalog and offers voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple AirPlay2. Besides having 4 HDMI ports that include a single audio return channel, the A8H also has a trio of USB ports and built-in Bluetooth for everything else.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5OkHSV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3arKN"&gt;One of our biggest issues with the Razer Nommo Pro when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17898382/razer-nommo-pro-review-consumers-producers-thx-dolby-stereo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;originally reviewed it in 2018&lt;/a&gt; was the overall cost, but this sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Pro-Certified-Illuminated/dp/B07DNSLL24?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon knocks more than $100 off the original MSRP&lt;/a&gt;, making it a far more attractive prospect. This THX-certified speaker system is one of the best ways to beef up your desktop audio without investing in a dedicated receiver. The system itself is composed of a pair of standing woofers and tweeters, a volume control knob, and a trashcan-sized subwoofer that serves as the hub that connects to your desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JcsGWP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758930"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BIFgP6"&gt;It’s tough to say no to a good pair of Beats, and right now you can grab a pair of the Beats Solo 3 Wireless in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo3-Wireless-Ear-Headphones/dp/B07YVYPNRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096%3Fpreselect%3D79358892%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $131, their second-best price to date. The well-built headphones are compatible with Android and iOS devices and can last for up to 40 hours on a single charge before needing to be topped off via MicroUSB. They sound decent enough, too, and pair effortlessly with iOS devices thanks to Apple’s integrated W1 chip. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review in 2016&lt;/a&gt; took some issue with the original sticker price of the Solo 3 Wireless, but this sale definitely makes the on-ear headphones far more appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dTwSmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hjeuE"&gt;If your desktop or PS5 needs a little extra breathing room, right now you can grab the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-970-evo-plus-2tb%2Fp%2FN82E16820147744%3FItem%3DN82E16820147744" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung 970 EVO Plus (2TB) at Newegg for just $250&lt;/a&gt;. No bigger than a stick of gum, this SSD is one of the easiest ways to expand the storage outside of finally cleaning out your downloads folder.....the OTHER downloads folder. These drives can be easily installed on any motherboard with a free M.2 slot, and thanks to a recent firmware update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your PS5 as well&lt;/a&gt;. Besides providing you with more storage space, the faster transfer speeds can help cut down on load times for games as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="q5aDHQ"&gt;If you’re looking to substantially upgrade your home theatre and are okay with spending an equally substantial amount of money, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-HW-Q950A-11-1-4ch-Soundbar-Dolby/dp/B08X1CH646?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfBzRYNK7Tv#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have knocked $300 off the incredibly popular Samsung HW-Q950A Soundbar. We haven’t had a chance to test this ourselves, but a quick trip to Google will reveal a list of glowing reviews, from Wired, Reviewed, and Techradar to name a few. Even a cursory glance at this absolute lad of a soundbar reveals that that praise is well warranted. This soundbar includes 11 speakers as well as a pair of upward-firing rear speakers and a subwoofer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Castlevania composer on returning to her ‘masterpiece’ with new Apple Arcade game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="castlevania grimoire of souls" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JqJ97KkJ4nx4ubdYHf10GK6QjVI=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876046/15_5120x2880.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHFvMA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623498/apple-arcade-castlevania-grimoire-of-souls"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just the long-awaited return of the vampire-whipping series. It also marks the return of some big names, including character designer Ayami Kojima and composer Michiru Yamane, who left Konami in 2008. Yamane previously worked on seminal &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; games like &lt;em&gt;Symphony of the Night&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dawn of Sorrow&lt;/em&gt;, and after going freelance she teamed up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15830788/koji-igarashi-bloodstained-castlevania-interview-e3-2017"&gt;longtime &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; director Koji Igarashi&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102612/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review-switch-ps4-xbox-pc-castlevania"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodstained&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her credits also include &lt;em&gt;Skullgirls&lt;/em&gt;, a few &lt;em&gt;Suikoden&lt;/em&gt; games, and &lt;em&gt;Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, though she calls her work on &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; her “masterpiece.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLjVFr"&gt;Ahead of the launch of &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;, which is out now on Apple Arcade, I had the chance to ask Yamane a few questions over email about her work and career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r8ssJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it feel to return to the franchise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXZSmt"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; series is my masterpiece from my days as a company employee, and it is also the series in which I participated in the largest number of titles. So I’m very happy to be able to participate in this project as a freelance musician again after all these years, and to be able to please the fans of this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTaYIP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For you, what makes a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castlevania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; soundtrack distinct? What are elements that are intrinsically &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castlevania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rdn7AY"&gt;The best thing about it is its worldview. Pipe organs, choirs, church bells, and other instruments and musical styles which are typical of the medieval European era. In particular, baroque and classical music is of course a point of differentiation. In addition to the academic Western classical music, there is also the essence of various music such as Ravel and Debussy, the essence of avant-garde music, and modern music (progressive rock) in odd time signatures. For example, the desert stage contains music with Middle Eastern melodies, or the water stage uses modal melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zRxKT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The best thing about [Castlevania] is its worldview.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi6aW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think the series’ sound has evolved over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdUr4P"&gt;It can be said that it has developed along with changes in the performance of game console. The PSG sound source of NES, followed by the Mega Drive, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2, has increased the range of expression as time has progressed. In the early days of video games, the number of simultaneous sounds was three, but as technology increased, the amount of data that we can handle increased, and the range of musical expression expanded. We can say the same thing for graphics. As the person in charge of music, I feel that as the expression of graphics has expanded, it has become possible to express artistic beauty by linking it to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF0R4T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there anything you wanted to do differently this time around?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoG4sD"&gt;Currently, my life’s work is healing music. Because of this, I create music in a slightly lower tuning “A = 432hz,” which is specialized for healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvtCHV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s latest Steam Next Fest for upcoming games will open on October 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6obZig34fQbDPOkb9i2kOBGWEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69876024/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Steam Next Fest is coming October 1st | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="asd8rX"&gt;Valve announced Friday that its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest"&gt;latest Steam Next Fest&lt;/a&gt; is coming the first week of October, giving access to playable demos of hundreds of upcoming PC games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFb3ei"&gt;A video teaser showed glimpses of a few games to expect to see in demo, including &lt;em&gt;Airhead&lt;/em&gt; from Octato Games, &lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; from Ludomotion, &lt;em&gt;ANNO:Mutationem&lt;/em&gt; from Thinking Stars, &lt;em&gt;Mahokenshi&lt;/em&gt; from Game Source Studio, &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers— Terran Command &lt;/em&gt;from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The Artistocrats,&lt;em&gt; Life of Delta&lt;/em&gt; from Airo Games, and more. And &lt;a href="https://za.ign.com/no-mans-sky/157295/news/the-last-campfire-from-the-creators-of-no-mans-sky-has-a-steam-release-date"&gt;IGN reported&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Last Campfire&lt;/em&gt;, from Hello Games, the creators of &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;, will also have a playable demo available as part of Next Fest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOFs4T"&gt;Gamers can “explore the latest from veteran devs and first-timers alike,” according to the promotional video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PVUlHJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8ykD5CeNWk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bwMzMw"&gt;Valve has been holding these online events for PC games every few months to try to fill the void of the in-person gaming and developer events that have been canceled or postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. Originally called the Steam Game Festival, Valve &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/next-fest-dates"&gt;changed the name&lt;/a&gt; to Steam Next Fest with its June 2021 event. For developers, it’s a chance to get feedback directly from fans about their upcoming games, because in addition to giving player access to game demos, the event will include livestreams with developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRrZ0I"&gt;Steam Next Fest opens October 1st at 1PM ET, and runs through October 7th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why you need a personal laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 closed, seen from above." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLfj3lG1YttwI3PmnqNi9YnwoHA=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69875898/akrales_210824_4723_0158.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, if my employer gave me a ThinkPad X1 Carbon, I’d want to use it all the time too. Don’t do it!&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf58oI"&gt;It’s a decision that may seem like a no-brainer. You’ve got a new job, and they’ve just given you a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;brand-new ThinkPad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Perfect&lt;/em&gt;, you think to yourself. &lt;em&gt;It’s about time I got rid of that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/16/2491224/apple-macbook-air-review-13-inch-mid-2011"&gt;&lt;em&gt;10-year-old MacBook Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myxhb0"&gt;I’ve been there. &lt;a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2020/10/work-devices-for-personal-use/"&gt;Surveys have shown&lt;/a&gt; that over half of workers use work-issued devices for personal tasks — whether sending personal messages, shopping online, accessing social media, or reading the news. The prospect of using your work laptop as your only laptop — not just for work, but also for Netflixing, group chat messaging, reading fanfiction, paying bills, and emailing recipes to your mom — is understandably tempting, especially for folks who work from home. Keeping work tasks and personal tasks in one place may feel like an easy way to simplify your life, and it might save space on your desk. Most of all, it may seem like a good cost-saving measure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHODuw"&gt;But I’m here to be the bearer of bad news: Don’t do that. Please, I’m begging you, don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 open on a red picnic table with a playground in the background. The screen displays a black desktop background with a multicolored cloud in the center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xb_wWFzsaSKNiLV96mJPaTBLrzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785983/mchin_191108_47150002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s one good, affordable option for a personal laptop: HP’s Pavilion Aero 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OvZ7wY"&gt;The most important thing to remember is that if you’re using a work laptop, you should assume IT can see what you’re doing. Companies have &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/01/05/how-employers-use-technology-to-surveil-employees/"&gt;all kinds of tools&lt;/a&gt; available to monitor their employees’ devices — keyloggers, biometric tracking, geolocation, software that tracks web browsing and social media behavior. &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-future-of-employee-monitoring/"&gt;Over half&lt;/a&gt; use some sort of monitoring technique, and their usage has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/employee-monitoring-tools-see-uptick-as-more-people-work-from-home.html"&gt;become more popular&lt;/a&gt; throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGnWlO"&gt;And, of course, your company can see what you’re doing in company-run programs like Slack and G-Suite Enterprise. Your novel you’ve been writing at night? Your Slack messages complaining to your co-workers about your boss? IT can see all of that. Even if you have separate personal accounts for these services, it’s still more likely that you’ll mix them up if you’re logged into both on the same computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qFODX"&gt;“If you’re on a work laptop, you should assume your IT can see everything,” says Ryan Toohil, who has worked in IT for 20 years and is currently CTO of Aura, a digital security firm. “It’s the company’s laptop. They own it. It’s enrolled in a corporate IT product where they’re going to be able to track where you go on the internet.” Toohil emphasized that not all IT departments are regularly digging through their employees’ web history — but there’s always a risk that they could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCW3kj"&gt;It’s not just your activity that your co-workers might be able to see — they could also get access to anything you download. Loading some personal photos or text messages onto your work device for safekeeping might seem harmless — you’ll just wipe them off before you hand it in, right? But some companies (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;such as Apple&lt;/a&gt;) won’t actually allow you to wipe your device before handing it in, regardless of how personal the contents are. Even if your employer doesn’t have such a policy, there’s still the possibility that you could be fired or laid off at short notice, or your company could collapse without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfPhQP"&gt;In these cases, you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have the time to move personal files off your laptop before turning it in, but depending on the circumstances of your termination, you could be locked out of it before you have the chance. “In most companies, the moment that you’re let go, that generally is kicking off an automated process that disables your access,” Toohil says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yCOH4"&gt;Even if you leave your company with plenty of notice, moving a bunch of things off your work device in the last few days of your tenure could raise some eyebrows with IT — who, remember, can see everything you’re doing on that device. “Let’s say you’re going to work at a competitor,” Toohil says. “They’re gonna go through that huge audit trail, see, wow, you moved a bunch of data off this laptop in the week before you left. And that opens up a huge liability for you personally. At a minimum, you’re going to spend some time explaining what you were doing. In the worst case, you took some corporate information.”  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Framework Laptop outdoors on a red tablecloth, seen from above, open. The screen displays a mountainous landscape." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYO_yB3BMumpxVohd38IqdX-zyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728999/mchin_210720_4671_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s another option to consider: the Framework Laptop, which lets you customize your ports and upgrade the processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RVw4Fl"&gt;And if things go wrong, the list of embarrassing possibilities is endless: do you really want to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/style/screen-share-disasters.html"&gt;this woman&lt;/a&gt;, who received a text message about pooping on her computer while sharing her screen with executives? Or &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2020/01/my-employee-accidentally-posted-porn-to-the-company-group-chat-and-now-wants-to-resign.html"&gt;this employee&lt;/a&gt;, who accidentally posted fetish porn in a company-wide group chat? Or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Daveastated/status/1250053121172213764"&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt;, who invited his current boss to join his job interview on Zoom? If you’re mixing work and pleasure on one device, just one mistaken email attachment or one incorrect copy / paste could lead to scenarios that aren’t just embarrassing but could harm your relationships with co-workers and even jeopardize your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOx3HC"&gt;I know using your work laptop as a personal laptop may seem like a decent cost-saving measure, especially if you’re one of the &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/348743/seven-u.s.-white-collar-workers-still-working-remotely.aspx"&gt;51 percent of US employees&lt;/a&gt; who work from home at least some of the time. But here’s the good news: a personal laptop doesn’t have to cost very much, especially if you just plan on using it for some emailing, Netflix, and tweeting. Some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; you can buy are regularly available for under $1,000 — and if you’re open to Chrome OS, some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; are under $400. I’ve tested all of these devices myself, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;$299 Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;$389.99 Asus Chromebook Detachable&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d have no problem using either as my primary personal device. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;a $329.99 iPad&lt;/a&gt; can do most laptop things, especially if you buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444822/zagg-pro-keys-trackpad-keyboard-case-ipad"&gt;keyboard case&lt;/a&gt;. Budget laptops have come a long way, and these devices are fast and very well made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL8KSA"&gt;Otherwise, what you’re looking for in a personal laptop will come down to your price range and the features you want. That’s a big benefit of a personal device, in fact — you can tailor the product to your needs and preferences in ways an IT department may not be able to accommodate. You can look at specifications like the processor (an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 should be the most you need for web browsing and Netflix), screen resolution (go for 1080p, unless you’re very particular), storage, memory, and weight (you can get affordable laptops as light as two pounds) — and you can find the combination that suits your lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED open on a table. The screen displays a black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Utc8HAgZJc_DN-EVa4baHDFwBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653793/mchin_20190905_4631_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s one of our favorite personal laptop recommendations, the Dell XPS 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HhYa6d"&gt;Plus, you can get perks out of personal laptops that you likely won’t see in a run-of-the-mill office notebook. Feel like trying out some games? Get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;something with a GPU&lt;/a&gt;. Are you an artist? Get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;something with a stylus&lt;/a&gt;. Want a tablet to keep your piano music on? Get something with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;detachable screen&lt;/a&gt;. Like pretty lights? Get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;something with an RGB keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. You can cover the product in all the skins, stickers, and decorations you want, and you can even get something that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536996/msi-ge66-raider-dragonshield-edition-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;looks totally ridiculous&lt;/a&gt; if that’s your whim. It’s your laptop — you’re the boss!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qmwHtp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a slight sense of freedom in knowing that Slack notifications won’t pop up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SF6ZZK"&gt;I’ll end on a personal note: many remote employees have trouble logging off. &lt;a href="https://go.morningconsult.com/rs/850-TAA-511/images/Remote%20Work%20Report%20-%20Morning%20Consult%20-%20Final.pdf"&gt;A majority feel&lt;/a&gt; that their personal and professional lives are more blended together than they would be with office access. Now that my work and my leisure happen in the same room, with no commute between them, it’s harder to ignore the nagging notion that I should be working — that even if I’m off the clock, there’s more I could be doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RasgZg"&gt;Speaking from experience, a personal laptop can help. I’m less tempted to peek at my work email if I’m not logged into it on my computer. And there’s a slight sense of freedom in knowing that Slack notifications won’t pop up while I’m watching &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; because Slack isn’t installed on my &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;-watching device. A personal laptop is an investment — not just in your security, but in your mental health. You should get one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8 new HomeKit features arriving with Apple’s September 20th software updates  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFrB4RSo4qr_67XyNG51mEUjUcU=/0x400:2400x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874081/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sm4we8"&gt;With new iPhones come new features. And starting next week, Apple HomeKit users will get plenty courtesy of iOS 15, HomePod 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8 software updates. Apple has confirmed that these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;will all be available on the same day, September 20th&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k51FQ2"&gt;So, if you’ve been excited about unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras, the HomePod Mini as a speaker for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22672587/apple-tv-tvos-15-features-release-date"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, or the chance to see your doorbell on your Apple Watch, you’re in luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn6TDY"&gt;Here’s a look at all the new HomeKit and HomeKit-related features that will be dropping on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jo8NY2eGt7DG9iorfWFYTw-oYsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22025414/dseifert_201107_4281_0005.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update will let you pair a single or pair of HomePod Minis to your Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6Won2G"&gt;Control your Apple TV with Siri on HomePod Mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="w9RK6D"&gt;Finally, you’ll be able to use Siri on your HomePod Mini to turn your Apple TV on and off, start a specific show or movie, or have it pause or resume playback for you. This has been a feature of Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant’s smart speakers for a while now (when paired with a Fire TV device or Chromecast), and we’re pleased to see Apple bringing Siri’s mini speaker up to par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFdFkO"&gt;Set your HomePod Mini as your Apple TV speaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxwnW"&gt;A single or pair of HomePod Minis can now be your Apple TV 4K’s default speaker. This feature was previously only available to the original (now discontinued) HomePod, but now it’s available for Apple’s more diminutive (and not discontinued) smart speaker. Additionally, the HomePod Mini can be the output for other audio devices using ARC / eARC, if your television has those inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple TV 4K can now show you multiple HomeKit camera feeds on the biggest screen in your house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUE4J2"&gt;Have your HomeKit cameras spot packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pLPGEg"&gt;Security cameras connected to Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video (Apple’s option for storing footage from your smart home cameras) through an Apple TV 4K or HomePod Mini can now tell you when they see a package. This is in addition to people, animal, and vehicle detection and will increase the usefulness of the two HKSV compatible residential doorbells currently on the market — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163585/logitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video"&gt;Logitech View&lt;/a&gt; and the Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SRazyy"&gt;See multiple HomeKit cameras on your Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Im16Y5"&gt;The Apple TV can now stream multiple feeds from your HomeKit cameras instead of only one, so you can survey your domain from the big screen. It will also offer up control of nearby accessories such as a porch light, so you can turn on the lights using the remote,  no need to get your phone out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OMjPaC"&gt;Add unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oVMCFU"&gt;Speaking of multiple cameras, with the iOS15 update on your iPhone and iPad you can now add an unlimited number of cameras to HomeKit Secure Video if you sign up for the new iCloud Plus 2TB plan ($9.99 a month). Previously, 5 was the maximum number allowed, which is a bit limiting if you want to cover a whole home inside and out with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV3g8Rm4NYnw6didqLbXbN_KBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16308986/dseifert_190530_3460_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ecobee SmartThermostat is the first confirmed Siri-enabled accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sKsTIh"&gt;Talk to Siri in more places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vqGlQF"&gt;The voice assistant is coming to other speaker-enabled HomeKit accessories. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt; is the only confirmed accessory so far — and the function won’t go live for a few more weeks, according to Ecobee. But it’s likely more devices will follow soon, enabling you to ask Siri to control smart home devices, set timers and alarms, and use the intercom feature in more rooms in your home. You will still need to have a HomePod Mini on the same network for the device to relay the requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AQaTqY"&gt;Tell Siri to do something later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6VW0TX"&gt;Siri is getting smarter about home control, adding the ability for you to ask the voice assistant to do something later or based on an event. That means you’ll be able to use commands such as “Hey Siri, turn off the lights when I leave home,” or “Hey Siri, turn off the TV at 6 p.m.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpr6RaUnkXF2S_If_9TwlUqEZrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858560/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update for Apple Watch lets you view your HomeKit doorbell camera feed on your watch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Enr29Y"&gt;Control your home on your wrist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zXy3Gj"&gt;With WatchOS 8, the Apple Home app gets a much-needed redesign. Now when you access individual accessories as well as HomeKit Scenes, the watch will use context to determine which ones to offer up for control. You can also now view HomeKit-enabled camera feeds from a doorbell camera directly on your wrist and use Intercom to quickly broadcast a message to the whole home, individual rooms, or personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj04Cg"&gt;To update your HomePod and HomePod Mini’s software, go to the Home Settings in the Apple Home app (you can turn on automatic updates here). For Apple TV 4K, look in the settings menu on your device and for the Apple Watch, use the Watch app on your iPhone or the settings app on the watch itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPp7E6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:26AM ET, September 18th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that the article is referring to Siri on a HomePod Mini, not the discontinued HomePod, to control the Apple TV. Added the information that the HomePod Mini can also be the audio output for other devices through ARC / eArc. Clarified that the new feature for accessing accessories and Scenes on the Apple Watch is that the Home app offers up relevant accessories and Scenes using context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmail-1essHD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 8:26AM ET September 18th 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this article stated the update will let you view camera feeds on your watch and that you can unlock a door using HomeKit on AppleTV. You can already view video feeds on the Apple Watch, the update adds the ability to view feeds from a doorbell camera. You can only control secure accessories such as door locks through a personal device not through the Apple TV interface. We regret the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDtToU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LA3MH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a room, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lightning or other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;We’ve previously seen the fourth-gen Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29, however, it’s currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers for full price. Best Buy, however, will also throw in a free Sengled smart bulb and take $10 off if you buy two, meaning you’d pay $90 instead of $100. There is also a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other info that is available for $60, the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the Kids Edition is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers for $60, the full MSRP. Amazon is selling a discounted bundle for $75, however, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Amazon does &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M1MRHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offer a $100 bundle that includes a free Ring Smart Bulb&lt;/a&gt;, though, and Target is currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal/-/A-80770246/&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22362455%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $20 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $180. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3g4zTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccs5nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2-megapixel camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 6 is currently available for $85 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer the first-gen model, it’s available at the same retailers for $80 (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747625078603978178#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6d2iBD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently only available for $110 — its full retail price — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080p security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $131. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08J8FFJ8H_toAsin_B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742759409782754841#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fthis-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $130. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle that contains a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blink Mini for $140&lt;/a&gt; or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

All three retailers are also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini security camera, for $260 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfA9yum1C1P#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148115/2092?subId1=VergeEchoDot091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
