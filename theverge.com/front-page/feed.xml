    <title>Democrats are gearing up to fight for net neutrality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senator Markey Holds Get-Out-The-Early-Vote Rallies" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSby1u0udz9ncCEivgbJbOlZyqY=/0x0:5098x3399/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938112/1228227467.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxRPoP"&gt;A new bill to bring back net neutrality is on its way, supported by one of the open internet’s most fervent advocates. At an advocacy event last month, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) announced that he would be introducing a measure in the next few “weeks” that would engrave the no throttling, block, or paid fast lanes rules into law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fxgm0"&gt;Reached by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday, Markey reaffirmed his commitment to introducing a bill soon. “The coronavirus pandemic has proven that broadband is as essential as electricity and other utilities. We need to restore net neutrality protections to ensure that our internet remains open and free and that consumers can continue to benefit from this critical infrastructure,” Markey told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBjG6i"&gt;Legislation like Markey plans to introduce could finally put the debate over net neutrality to rest and secure open internet protections for Americans under Title II for good, immune from the back-and-forth of the Tom Wheeler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;and Ajit Pai orders&lt;/a&gt;. Net neutrality has more of a chance than ever with Democrats in control of Congress and the White House. But with a razor-thin majority in the Senate and most Republicans still firmly opposed, net neutrality legislation still faces a delicate path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4nhZQ9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Net neutrality has more of a chance than ever with Democrats in control of Congress and the White House&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFe8UD"&gt;Markey and his compatriots in the House have already seen some success in legislative efforts to revive the rules. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304522/net-neutrality-save-the-internet-act-house-of-representatives-approval"&gt;Markey’s Save the Internet Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in the House by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA), was approved by a significant margin, but was never taken up in the Senate under former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) leadership. Another measure, through the Congressional Review Act (CRA), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357592/net-neutrality-senate-vote-cra-reinstate-fcc-rules"&gt;received a 52-47 vote&lt;/a&gt; to overturn the Pai Federal Communications Commission’s rollback of the rules. Three Republicans, Sens. John Kennedy (R-LA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Susan Collins (R-ME), all voted on a measure to bring back the rules, signaling that there could be some bipartisan support for a new bill in the Senate as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7qdLy"&gt;But the window for another CRA vote has long since passed, making it more difficult for Democrats to find the votes necessary to approve net neutrality legislation in the Senate. There are also Senate Democrats who could vote against a bill. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) was part of a working group with Sen. Roger Wicker (R-LA) in previous congresses that sought to draft a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2019/3/wicker-and-sinema-announce-net-neutrality-working-group"&gt;bill to bridge the partisan divide&lt;/a&gt;. No bill ever came out of that group, but it would likely include net neutrality’s three brightline rules: no throttling, blocking, or paid prioritization of web traffic. But without Title II, an FCC classification that gives the commission more authority to regulate broadband, a bill would be a nonstarter for many Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNTdlG"&gt;“It’s not just about net neutrality that’s about closing the digital divide that it’s about making sure that broadband is affordable and accessible to everyone that it’s reliable. Right now the FCC can’t do any of that,” Chris Lewis, the president and CEO of Public Knowledge, said Monday of Title II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pqdSWS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not just about net neutrality that’s about closing the digital divide”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SMorSl"&gt;If a legislative solution isn’t viable, Democrats are preparing to pressure the FCC to take measures into their own hands (again). In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Markey said, “Once we have three Democrats in place at the Federal Communications Commission, I will strongly urge it to reverse the Trump FCC’s wrongheaded decision and restore net neutrality and the FCC’s authority over broadband.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZY74S"&gt;By appointing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel&lt;/a&gt; to lead the FCC in the interim in January, President Biden signaled that he would approve of a net neutrality advocate chairing the commission. But the FCC is currently gridlocked with two Democrats and two Republicans, making it impossible for it to move forward on open internet rules. As of Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/03/09/scoop-biden-taps-another-big-tech-trustbuster-492042"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Biden has selected Lina Khan, an anti-monopoly researcher and expert, to join the Federal Trade Commission. This nomination, once confirmed, would bring the FTC back to a working majority, potentially signaling that the FCC could be next in line for a nomination. Activists are already lining up to ensure that Biden’s pick for the next FCC commissioner won’t have any ties to the telecom industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4jI4n"&gt;“The first battle is ensuring that whoever the Biden administration nominates for that fifth position that the FCC is someone who’s a real fighter, who’s going to stand up and make sure that the FCC is an agency that is protecting people’s basic right to connect to the internet safely affordably,” Evan Greer, deputy director for Fight for the Future, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfAIqb"&gt;The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding its FCC nomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amju8a"&gt;Still, any measure that would put net neutrality rules back in place at the FCC would be subject to yet another reversal under a new Republican-led administration in the next few years, making it even more important for Congress to try to find a solution. State laws are also beginning to go into effect. Last month, a federal judge ruled that California could begin enforcing its state’s net neutrality law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGeiqa"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/net-neutrality-2021-legislation.aspx"&gt;nine states&lt;/a&gt; have introduced some form of net neutrality legislation this year. If more of these laws are approved, it could make legislating at the federal level even more of a challenge with Republicans seeking to make those laws moot through preemption. This momentum in the states could force both Republicans and Democrats to get serious about net neutrality legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lobqes"&gt;“I think it shows real momentum,” Greer said of the California decision. “It certainly opens the door for other states to follow California’s lead and I think we will see that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJOjt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos Roam officially announced for $169, preorders start now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RogTuxUZq_6AqOHo_f9EI96BTEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937910/Roam1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rALqmP"&gt;There wasn’t much left that we didn’t already know, but today, Sonos has officially announced its latest speaker, the Sonos Roam. Just as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313451/sonos-roam-leak-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, the Roam is a portable battery-powered speaker priced at $169. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Preorders start today,&lt;/a&gt; and it will go on sale on April 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuy09O"&gt;The Sonos Move was the company’s first try at a portable product, but it’s quite large and hefty to actually travel with. The Roam, however, is a true “bring it anywhere” speaker. It’s the smallest speaker that Sonos has ever made, though the measurements I gave you last week were a hair off. It’s actually 6.61 x 2.44 x 2.36 inches and weighs 0.95 pounds. With dimensions like that, the big question is whether the Roam can live up to the reputation Sonos has established for good sound quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvgqR15-vT6hbkrJGYjNlgkztgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355745/Top_Detail.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tCjXhl"&gt;I haven’t heard the thing firsthand, so I can’t yet say how it compares to a UE Boom, JBL Charge, or one of Bose’s portable speakers. Sonos has packed the Roam with “two Class-H amplifiers.” There’s a tweeter for high frequencies and a “custom racetrack” mid-woofer — similar in shape to what’s in the Arc soundbar — that “ensures faithful playback of mid-range frequencies and maximizes low-end output.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0F5L0"&gt;Here’s how everything fits together:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CB9ZCZpeqVaiNXKbpLlHLFKKJg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354858/SonosRoamExplode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrsuni"&gt;Sonos is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price"&gt;bringing automatic Trueplay to the Roam&lt;/a&gt;, so it will tune audio output for the best results based on whatever room or environment that the speaker is in. (It does this by using the built-in mics, which are also there for the purpose of hands-free Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.) Two Roams can be set up as a stereo pair over Wi-Fi, but unfortunately, this option isn’t available when you’re playing music over Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLqqyy"&gt;Unlike the Move, which made you choose between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modes, the Roam takes advantage of both connections at once. You can play something from your phone with Bluetooth on the Roam and extend it across your whole multiroom Sonos system. (Yes, the company confirmed to me that this is also an easy way to get Bluetooth-enabled turntables playing on all your Sonos speakers.) Apple’s AirPlay 2 is also supported, and as always, you can play audio from a ton of services through the Sonos mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/caOe3CB_VSkW-dNa6dlm-bxh7RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355764/RoamCamp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6RSiC"&gt;The Roam can last for up to 10 hours of audio playback on a charge, and a USB-C charging cable comes in the box. As I said last week, Sonos is also selling a wireless charging stand — the Roam attaches to it magnetically — but you can use any Qi wireless charger that will fit the speaker when it’s standing up, so that’s nice. When not in use, the Roam can last for up to 10 days of standby time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIDiLw"&gt;Like the Move before it, Sonos says the Roam has been put through a ton of durability tests. The speaker has silicone at both ends to help protect it when dropped. It’s rated IP67 for dust and water resistance, so it can endure baths of up to a meter for 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDMbm0"&gt;Another neat Roam trick is called Sound Swap. Just hold the play / pause button on the top for three seconds, and the Roam will pass the music it’s playing to whatever other Sonos speaker in your system is closest. The way Sonos achieves this is clever: when Sound Swap is activated, all of your Sonos speakers will emit a high-pitched frequency that people (and dogs, I’m told) can’t hear. This is how the Roam figures out which one is nearby. This type of handoff could prove useful for an eventual, long-rumored set of Sonos noise-canceling headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beyZqv"&gt;The Roam seems like a compelling product for Sonos, and I’ve already seen a lot of excitement about a variety of use cases. Is it the perfect bathroom speaker? The ideal speaker for tossing into your bag when traveling? Taking to the beach or park? A ton hinges on how good it sounds for $169. For that verdict, stay tuned for our full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC may be teasing the release of a VR lip tracker for Vive headsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJH4bFrXDjGmEo0Mopm5FU3YGfQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937812/akrales_191003_3707_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmNamF"&gt;HTC may be teasing new modules and attachments for its Vive virtual reality headsets, including a lip tracker, &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/htc-lip-tracking-tease"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl1qJx"&gt;HTC’s been building up to some kind of announcement on its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/htcvive"&gt;Vive Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; over the last week. Yesterday, it posted an image of a hinge, which savvy Twitter users matched to an experimental lip tracking module HTC announced at the Game Developers Conference in 2019. You can see a picture of the hinged product HTC is teasing and a matching photo of its lip tracking device below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wFix8c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Pl6Z5eojD4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pl6Z5eojD4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rλmes VR (@vr_rames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vr_rames/status/1369018088587419653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wq6u1"&gt;At the time, the company said it was using the module for research and experimentation, &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/htc-vive-pro-lip-tracking-module-gdc-2019/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Road to VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Combined with the eye tracking HTC’s already integrated into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655871/htc-vive-pro-eye-vr-headset-eye-tracking-price-release-us-canada"&gt;Vive Pro Eye&lt;/a&gt;, it offers an early picture of what full face tracking looks like in VR. Some developers have gotten their hands on that earlier version of the lip tracker and integrated into social VR apps like &lt;a href="https://neos.com/"&gt;NeosVR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AMKm5k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukKHVYwzZRA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XgmAnL"&gt;Hand, face, and eye tracking features play a large part in making avatars move and appear “natural” in VR. The HTC Vive and Oculus Rift and Quest headsets already offer hand tracking as a control method, but face tracking (enabled by an attachment or eventually new headset designs) could prove to be a boon in social VR settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmnlqX"&gt;Facebook was already experimenting with face tracking for Oculus headsets in 2019, &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/frl-multiview-face-tracking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. In a recent interview, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also reiterated how important &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;realistic avatars&lt;/a&gt; — animated with face and eye tracking — are to his vision of the future of VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzuKoC"&gt;HTC hasn’t actually confirmed that it’s releasing a version of its lip tracking module to the public. But either way, getting comfortable with headsets sensing you as much as they do your surroundings seems like it’s in the cards for VR enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmJRvG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: T-Mobile will start sharing customer info with advertisers unless you opt out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kI5Iqa2CQKwkctUCqH1NRDzHl3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937654/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will soon start sharing certain customer data with marketers to provide more relevant ads. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZ741t"&gt;T-Mobile will soon put a new privacy policy into effect that will allow it to share certain kinds of customer information with third-party advertisers. Starting on April 26th, 2021, all customers will be automatically opted in to the new program, as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Customers who don’t want to participate will need to manually opt out using their accounts’ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0R5BD"&gt;T-Mobile’s new policy is no different than &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/csr/home/privacy/overview.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-32&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt;. This is an about-face for former Sprint customers, however. T-Mobile acknowledges in its announcement of the policy change that Sprint offered a similar opt-&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; service rather than an opt-out one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pYDROX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies say the data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mHh4aS"&gt;The new policy includes the same kind of provisions as AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for sharing user data with third-party marketers in the name of providing more relevant advertising. The companies say that data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities and that they don’t share information that’s associated with a child’s device or service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppHqnT"&gt;As harmless as the carriers make this practice sound, it’s something people are growing increasingly wary of. As a response, companies like Google are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;working to make their data-gathering and sharing practices less intrusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncN7JZ"&gt;If you’re not wild about your carrier sharing data about you with advertisers, it’s easy enough to opt out of these services.

    <title>Microsoft is ending support for the old non-Chromium Edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft edge" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBFmCDP3egTxXtur2-se-G-IJfE=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937630/e1.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fo0IqW"&gt;Support for Microsoft’s Edge browser is ending today — not the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration"&gt;Chromium-based&lt;/a&gt; one, but the original Edge that was built as a replacement for Internet Explorer 11. Microsoft now calls it Legacy Edge, and the company &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666"&gt;announced it would be discontinuing the product&lt;/a&gt; back in August. That day has finally come: Legacy Edge will no longer receive security updates, and anyone still using it should start the process of switching to something else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erxDYf"&gt;Legacy Edge was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/8/7516489/windows-10-new-browser-spartan-features"&gt;originally codenamed “Spartan”&lt;/a&gt; and was included with Windows 10 as the operating system’s default web browser before it was officially named Edge. The Edge mantle is being taken up by Microsoft’s Chromium-based browser, which was in beta throughout 2019 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20942038/microsoft-edge-chromium-release-date-new-logo-features"&gt;officially launched in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This means Edge (the old Edge, that is) survived just over a year alongside its replacement. Microsoft also says Legacy Edge &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/new-microsoft-edge-to-replace-microsoft-edge-legacy-with-april-s/ba-p/2114224"&gt;will automatically be removed&lt;/a&gt; by the April Windows 10 update, with the new Edge being installed in its stead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="338H3p"&gt;If you’re the tech support person for your family, it’s worth checking in with your relatives to make sure Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;successfully bullied them into switching to the new Edge&lt;/a&gt;. If, somehow, it’s not installed on their computers (or your computer), you can download it &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fedge&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321779%2Fmicrosoft-edge-legacy-spartan-browser-support-ended" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Microsoft’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GA9f56"&gt;The death of Legacy Edge is bittersweet in some ways. By most metrics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313433/microsoft-edge-vertical-tabs-startup-boost-features"&gt;the new Edge is vastly superior&lt;/a&gt;, but it does put the final nail in the coffin of Microsoft’s custom web-rendering engines, the history of which stretches back to early versions of Internet Explorer. It probably won’t be missed, given its... performance, but it’s still the end of an era. The old Edge is officially gone, and the new Edge has fully replaced it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 review: AMD and Nvidia at their best</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s simply the best&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q6UuhJ"&gt;When I tested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG’s Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; a year ago, I was blown away. Not only was it just over 3.5 pounds — a weight unheard of for a system with both a powerful processor and a discrete GPU — but it ran even the most demanding games at much better frame rates than any gaming laptop we’d ever seen at that size. And then everything else about it — the keyboard, the touchpad, the audio, the battery life — was also great. The G14 wasn’t just better than other gaming laptops in those areas: it was better than most other laptops at its price point, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWZi0B"&gt;Given the G14’s resounding success, it was only a matter of time before Asus put it in a 15-inch chassis. The formula wasn’t broken, and Asus didn’t fix it — Asus just made it bigger. While I had some questions when I heard the G15 was on the way (could it deliver the same combination of portability, battery life, and performance as a 14-inch product? Could it do that without costing over $2,000?), what’s become clear throughout my testing period is that the device isn’t just as good as its 14-inch counterpart; it’s somehow even better. Asus and AMD have done it again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Zephyrus logo on the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GBalSnXWC5SsSNVk4BZB4khozJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341897/akrales_210226_4440_0130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaming on Cloud 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HWfSaG"&gt;The G15’s secret weapon is its processor. All models have AMD’s monstrous eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HS. My test model, priced at $1,799.99, pairs that chip with Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 3070 (an 80W version, with dynamic boost up to 100W), as well as 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. This configuration is a step above the base model, which includes an RTX 3060 and 512GB of storage. There are also two RTX 3080 models — pair it with 16GB of RAM for $1,999.99 or 32GB of RAM for $2,499.99. (I think my test model hits a sweet spot: 512GB of storage isn’t a lot for a gaming laptop, and it seems like the RTX 3080 models are &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G15-laptop-review-Eye-catcher.517789.0.html"&gt;fairly low-clocked&lt;/a&gt; and don’t perform hugely better than the lower-tier options.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4mlaUk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10382482"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mRqKJUyaFM-6ibL3L-8Rb_2gO7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341902/akrales_210226_4440_0199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the G15 has a “desktop-inspired layout” with separate keys to control the volume, toggle the microphone, and pull up Armoury Crate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="I2Jg3e"&gt;Another highlight, consistent across all models, is the G15’s 165Hz QHD display. We’re finally starting to see 15-inch laptops with QHD screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;en masse this year&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that this is the first year that manufacturers think mobile hardware is powerful enough to take advantage of them. Traditionally, mobile gamers have had the option of a 1080p display or a 4K display. (Not only is the latter quite expensive, but very few laptops can run demanding games at playable frame rates in 4K.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 half open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays two large rocks with a person running towards them seen across a body of water." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOls4hR6yunICRTjJJFN-zK9XjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341889/akrales_210226_4440_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get over 3.5 million pixels from this QHD display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rbrUvf"&gt;So, the big question: Can the Zephyrus G15 run games at QHD resolution? The answer is an emphatic yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igOHW0"&gt;Some raw numbers to start. The G15 averaged 178fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO &lt;/em&gt;at maximum settings — dust particles, fires, and other graphically intensive effects looked just fine. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;, also at maximum settings, averaged 58fps. (Come on, that’s basically 60). Ray tracing was no problem for this machine: the system averaged 61fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing on ultra, and a whopping 81fps with ray tracing off. Remember, the G15 is running these at QHD resolution, which is already a bigger haul than traditional 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HMrwev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ray tracing was no problem for this machine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BqvnS8"&gt;Those frame rates mean you should be able to run whatever game you want in QHD without bumping down any settings. They put the G15 about on par with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI’s GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; with an Intel Core i7-10870H and a GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q — the two laptops tied on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; and were just one frame apart on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. MSI told us that the QHD GS66 model costs $2,599 — so the G15 with an RTX 3070 is getting the same frame rates for literally $800 less. The G15 also did better than the QHD / RTX 3070 Intel configuration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; (53fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;, 46fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;), which costs &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0369BEA2-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 more&lt;/a&gt;. Those differentials should speak for themselves. Yes, the GS66 has a 240Hz screen, but that’s going to be excessive for most people at QHD resolution. If I didn’t already know where the G14 was priced last year, I would be emailing Asus to check if $1,799.99 was a typo. It’s an unbelievable value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nh6K1o"&gt;The games all looked great on this screen, which covers 100 percent of the sRGB gamut and 89 percent of AdobeRGB, and maxes out at 334 nits of brightness. It isn’t the highest refresh-rate screen you can get at 165Hz — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; has a 240Hz QHD model, as does MSI’s GS66 Stealth — but it’s still a significant step above the Zephyrus G14’s 120Hz display. While the G15 doesn’t deliver the best picture I’ve ever seen, it still looks great and certainly improves upon the G14’s 1080p panel. Movement was all smooth, without a stutter in sight, and colors looked great. I saw a small amount of glare when using the device outdoors, but it was still quite usable at maximum brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports and vents on the right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdKL7LimZF1CZUjZ7MJlVu62oWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341892/akrales_210226_4440_0081.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right: one Kensington lock slot, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one microSD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SJuca_GyJUIYL85M4RWvkRHqPYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341890/akrales_210226_4440_0065.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left: one power port, one HDMI 2.0b, one RJ45 Ethernet port, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C with DisplayPort 1.4 and power delivery, one combo audio jack jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E0EYb4"&gt;Cooling, while sometimes iffy on the G14, is stellar on this device. The G15’s “intelligent cooling” system includes two 84-blade fans and six heat pipes. It had no problem with any of the games I threw at it, spending the vast majority of its time between the mid-60s and mid-70s (Celsius) and never jumping above 80 degrees. That’s some of the best cooling performance I’ve ever seen from a gaming laptop, especially considering that this one was running heavy AAA titles, maxed out, at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bnNwf4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cooling is stellar on this device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zL2NAs"&gt;More impressively, the fans managed to do this without being deafeningly loud. I could certainly hear them while the machine was under load, but it was standard gaming-laptop noise, and I had no problem hearing game audio. You can also swap to the “Silent” profile in Asus’ Armoury Crate software. That toggle lived up to its name and completely silenced the fans, without causing any heat or performance problems that I observed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg6LgL"&gt;Speaking of audio, the G15’s speakers also sound great. That’s to be expected — there are literally six of them, including two front-facing tweeters and force-canceling woofers under the palm rests. They deliver clear audio with very strong bass and powerful percussion. I don’t often get to say that about laptop audio, especially on gaming laptops. The G15 comes preloaded with Dolby Access, which you can use to jump between equalizer presets for gaming, movies, and music, and it makes a huge difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="d5bkyR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10382607"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgwXSJ"&gt;There are three microphones, which had no trouble picking up my voice. They also have presets for game streaming, music recording, and conference calls. Those are handy, but they’re not enough to make the G15 a good choice for remote work because it doesn’t include a webcam. The G14 also didn’t have a camera — Asus seems to have decided that webcams aren’t necessary on Zephyrus products. It’s the one significant knock against a device that is basically perfect otherwise. It’s also very odd to have such an advanced microphone setup and not have a webcam to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qifwqa"&gt;There are a couple other things to note about the G15’s chassis. Like many other Asus laptops, the G15 has an ErgoLift hinge, which folds under the deck when the laptop is open and lifts the keyboard above the ground. This is supposed to create a more ergonomic typing position, though I can’t say I ever noticed the difference. It does dig into your legs a bit if you’re using the laptop on your lap, though. The G15’s hinge isn’t as sharp as some other hinges, but as a frequent couch user, it’s still not my favorite feeling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wHoQun"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard and touchpad are both great&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77D1oY"&gt;The keyboard and touchpad are both great as well. The G14 had one of my favorite keyboards of 2020, and the G15’s is quite similar. The click is comfortable, with 1.7mm of travel, and the dedicated volume keys (a Zephyrus staple) are quite convenient. There’s a fingerprint sensor built into the power button, which is on the top right of the keyboard deck.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YR48Hq"&gt;The touchpad is massive, at 5.1 x 3.4 inches — 20 percent larger than that of the prior G15 generation. It’s so big that large portions of both my hands were resting on it when they weren’t typing, rather than on the palm rests. This was a bit annoying, but to the G15’s credit, it didn’t cause any palm-rejection issues. It’s also a bit loud and not the easiest or deepest click, but those are nitpicks — it’s a fine touchpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Republic of Gamers logo on the lid of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UIuYOz6xuJIJhRJO1rUtEweqe30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341893/akrales_210226_4440_0093.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid and deck are made of magnesium-aluminum, with a “wear-resistant coating.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The bottom right segment of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 lid." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DXZrmuyJH2spFaGpFZoky9Zp0PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341894/akrales_210226_4440_0098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid is covered in a dot matrix design. There are 8,279 “perfectly spaced perforations.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbAwE4"&gt;But what impressed me the most about the G15 is its battery life. This thing never dies. Using it as my daily driver with an office workload on Asus’ Silent profile around 200 nits of brightness, I averaged eight hours and 32 minutes. That’s just under what I got from the G14, and the G15 has a larger and higher-resolution screen to fuel. The result puts the G15 right up there with its smaller sibling as one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops we’ve ever seen. It has a large 90Wh battery inside, but plenty of gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536996/msi-ge66-raider-dragonshield-edition-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;rigs&lt;/a&gt; with comparable bricks can only make it a few hours on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="nhEQes"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The G15 is one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops we’ve ever seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yksEnT"&gt;Gaming significantly shortens the G15’s life span, of course. I got an hour and 21 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; out of one charge. Impressively, though, the game was quite playable for much of that time, avoiding stutters and performance issues. The game didn’t drop below playable rates until the G15 was down to 10 percent with six minutes remaining. The 200-watt charger also juices the G15 decently fast — during very light Chrome use, it got the device up to 60 percent in 37 minutes. If you don’t want to carry that heavy brick around and aren’t doing GPU-intensive tasks, the G15 also supports 100W Type-C charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JLgjcY_2KMF_8qLRHbCwZhJO2ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341901/akrales_210226_4440_0177.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;G15s are available in eclipse gray (like this model) and moonlight white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="biSl7n"&gt;At the end of the day, there are things I can nitpick about this device. In particular, the lack of a webcam is egregious. And there are reasons it won’t be for everyone. Folks who are looking for a higher refresh-rate screen may prefer to spend more on a Blade 15 Advanced or a GS66. Those who want a jazzier design may find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt; a better fit. And while $1,799 is a great value for these specs, anyone on a tighter budget has options like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo’s Legion 5&lt;/a&gt; on the table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wnw6fA"&gt;But almost everything about this laptop is fantastic. And not only is it fantastic, but it’s fantastic for several hundreds of dollars less than its QHD competitors. If you are willing to use an external webcam and you don’t need a 240Hz screen, there’s really no reason you should be buying any other QHD laptop in the thin 15-inch class. The G15 is superior on battery life, superior on power, superior on weight, and superior on price. It’s just the best. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ajJQjg"&gt;The Xbox Series X and Series S are some of the hottest and most challenging gadgets to buy right now. Fortunately, the Microsoft Store has restocked both the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F8wj714n3rbtl%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F942J774TP9JN%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-DwENKSyzuW9qbH9.LbNwQQ%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-DwENKSyzuW9qbH9.LbNwQQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0ku1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-DwENKSyzuW9qbH9.LbNwQQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0ku1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles. Get ‘em while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JWuNH4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hEaps5"&gt;Whether you purchase the most affordable next-gen console (the Xbox Series S) or Microsoft’s most powerful gaming console to date (Series X), both share many accessories that are great for early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93li6a"&gt;Several of the most popular games to play on these consoles include third-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Valhalla-PlayStation-Standard-upgrade-4/dp/B087XR2X4N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some popular Xbox One titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fori-the-collection%2F9p5mbbff3rnt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ori: The Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have all received graphical updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="w7cLmq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10248487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5tKiL6"&gt;Games aside, there are also a few accessories to consider — most notably, an extra game controller for your new console. You can expand your store, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external SSD&lt;/a&gt; you can purchase, but it is not cheap. Additionally, if you are not interested in buying some games now but need something to play, I suggest getting a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund has a new leader</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Week NYC Opening Ceremony" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERoZI9dRb6kMMyeJDtoOdnfg02A=/0x815:2055x2185/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937342/104309684.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Steer speaks at the opening ceremony for New York City’s Climate Week in 2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="neCEcv"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund has a new leader and a newly announced deadline. Andrew Steer will take the helm as president and CEO of the Earth Fund in mid-April after stepping down from his role leading one of the environmental organizations Bezos currently funds. According to Steer, Bezos intends to spend the entire $10 billion fund by 2030 — a date that hadn’t previously been publicly disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BnCKj"&gt;Choosing Steer to lead the Earth Fund is another signal that Bezos intends to spend his cash on mainstream strategies to address the climate crisis. Bezos’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;first group of grantees&lt;/a&gt; were mostly legacy environmental organizations that work toward the reduction of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, other high-profile efforts have funneled money into hastening the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;development of future technologies&lt;/a&gt; designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22245100/elon-musk-100-million-carbon-capture-removal-x-prize-competition"&gt;capture emissions&lt;/a&gt; after they’ve already been released. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Q6Qfd"&gt;Steer was the president of the World Resources Institute (WRI) for eight years, an organization that received one of the biggest grants from Bezos last November — $100 million. The nonprofit research institute said it would spend the money on &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/news/2020/11/release-gift-bezos-earth-fund-will-support-two-major-climate-initiatives-wri"&gt;two initiatives&lt;/a&gt; over five years. One project is a satellite monitoring system to track carbon dioxide emissions. WRI will also put the money toward electrifying more than 450,000 school buses in the US by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYOtwQ"&gt;Steer vaguely outlined some of the Earth Fund’s priorities on Twitter. “The Earth Fund will invest in scientists, NGOs, activists, and the private sector to help drive new technologies, investments, policy change and behavior,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewSteerWRI/status/1369317237807546372"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “We will emphasize social justice, as climate change disproportionately hurts poor and marginalized communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ADeGfH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Steer vaguely outlined some of the Earth Fund’s priorities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qyPasK"&gt;The Earth Fund has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some grassroots groups that say Bezos’ initial choice of grantees lacked diversity and didn’t do enough to curb emissions from Bezos’ company Amazon. Many mainstream environmental groups, including those Bezos chose to fund, are &lt;a href="https://diversegreen.org/"&gt;facing a reckoning&lt;/a&gt; over a lack of people of color among their ranks. The Climate Justice Alliance, whose members include environmental organizations led by people of color from communities that have faced a long legacy of pollution, has &lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/bezos-earth-fund-is-an-unnatural-disaster/"&gt;called on Bezos&lt;/a&gt; and his grantees to redirect money from the fund to their communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBjAqH"&gt;Bezos announced in February that he plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;step down&lt;/a&gt; from his role as CEO of Amazon this year. The move will give him more time for his “&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=0&amp;amp;imprToken=dcbc0c33-6d0e-6d39-48e&amp;amp;tag=curbedcom06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=w50"&gt;passions&lt;/a&gt;,” including the Earth Fund, he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this stunning FPV drone short film inside a bustling bowling alley</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3q42_K0HFUttn0bZiZZCx4hGyRM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936907/GIF_Bowling.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sW1NO"&gt;It’s been a while since most of us have been able to go to a bowling alley, but “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgS54fqKxf0"&gt;Right Up Our Alley&lt;/a&gt;” is a new drone video that might just be the next best thing, thanks to an astonishing display of camera work and drone piloting skill, &lt;a href="https://kottke.org/21/03/a-drones-eye-view-of-a-bowling-alley"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kottke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJoVQW"&gt;The video, from YouTuber jaybyrdfilms, doesn’t provide too many details, other than it was shot at &lt;a href="https://www.bryantlakebowl.com/"&gt;Bryant Lake Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in Minneapolis, and it was filmed with an FPV drone. But the footage speaks for itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQRqGC"&gt;At first, it gives off the impression of a standard drone flight, with a bird’s-eye view of the building itself. But things quickly shift as the pilot meticulously swoops the drone &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the open door of the bowling alley, maneuvering past diners and waiting bowlers before swooping down the alley itself alongside a spinning bowling ball. Throughout the short clip, the pilot manages to fly the drone back behind the pin setting machines, down a narrow corridor of tools and parts, behind the bar, and even into the pins for a perfect strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LMFWf"&gt;Selling the short film is perfectly dubbed dialogue from bowlers, customers, and the ambient noise from the alley itself, which gives the illusion of actually soaring around the alley as snippets of conversation float by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKB9Ge"&gt;Aspiring pilots might want to just enjoy this one from a distance. Unless you’re an expert drone pilot yourself, though, you might not want to risk a new $1,299 DJI FPV drone to re-create the film in your own local bowling alley. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus surpasses 100 million subscribers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flT-MzE9aU7iWNz0qfxP0L-Ud3Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936883/wandavision.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AIoj03"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; has officially surpassed 100 million subscribers, less than a year and a half after the streaming service launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcJgO2"&gt;Executives announced the milestone during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/disney"&gt;Disney’s&lt;/a&gt; annual shareholders meeting. The last time Disney gave an update on Disney Plus’ subscribers number was in February during its first quarter earnings; there, it announced that, as of January 2nd, 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;there were just over 94 million&lt;/a&gt;. Although executives didn’t say what pushed Disney Plus over 100 million subscribers, the recent success of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303068/wandavision-episode-8-explainer-recap-scarlet-witch-white-vision-post-credits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;likely helped. The next big series for Disney Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;out on March 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM1yMq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;The enormous success of Disney Plus ... has inspired us to be even more ambitious, and to significantly increase our investment in the development of high-quality content,” CEO Bob Chapek said in a press release. “In fact, we set a target of [more than] 100 new titles per year, and this includes Disney Animation, Disney Live Action, Marvel, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars,&lt;/em&gt; and National Geographic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="00mtKI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrAUFg"&gt;Disney’s streaming success has caught the attention of everyone in the industry. Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-praises-disney-plus-execution.html"&gt;didn’t think it was possible&lt;/a&gt; that Disney could generate 60 million subscribers for Disney Plus within its first year, and now it has passed 100 million subscribers within 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0OaIZ"&gt;Disney executives originally predicted that Disney Plus would amass between 60 and 90 million subscribers by 2024. The company has blown past that goal and is now targeting between 300 and 350 million subscribers across &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-surpasses-137-million-paid-subscriptions-across-its-direct-to-consumer-services-shattering-previous-guidance-increases-paid-subscriptions-target-to-300-350-million-by/"&gt;all of its streaming platforms&lt;/a&gt; (Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus, Star Plus, HotStar) by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sju4z"&gt;To try to continue growing Disney Plus’ subscriber base, Chapek reiterated that Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.” There are currently several series from every major franchise and brand in development, and it seems likely more mid-tier films (movies that aren’t on the same level as &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, or &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;) will migrate to Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HsNhQd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no question that Disney has pulled off an incredible feat with Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8t5dvp"&gt;While 100 million subscribers is an accomplishment, analysts will likely have questions about the revenue breakdown. In December, Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, announced that 30 percent of Disney Plus’ subscriber base comes from Disney Plus HotStar, where the average revenue per customer is lower. As Netflix’s vice president of investor relations, Spencer Wang, pointed out in January, the overall revenue is lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvNuf3"&gt;Still, there’s no question that Disney has pulled off an incredible feat with Disney Plus. Other competitors, like WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal, are trying to scale their own streaming services (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) but are growing at a much slower pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV6ewx"&gt;During the meeting, Disney executive chairman Bob Iger reiterated that he was going to leave the company at the end of the year. This mark’s his final shareholder meeting. Considering he saw the conception and launch of Disney Plus, what an incredible feat to go out on. &lt;/p&gt;
