    <title>Tesla’s Autopilot may not have been available at the time of the ‘driverless’ Texas crash </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdhnTiuBMI0Pfx9dn0PHp1EDRH4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264548/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GEb8xZ"&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HWY21FH007-preliminary-report.pdf"&gt;two-page preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;deadly crash of a Tesla Model S in Texas last month&lt;/a&gt; in which local authorities said there was no one in the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm77OV"&gt;There are several relevant disclosures in the NTSB report. The first is that security camera footage from the owner’s home captured the owner entering the driver’s side door, while his companion got in on the passenger side. The car leaves the house, travels 550 feet before departing the road on a curve, hitting a drainage culvert, a raised manhole, and a tree. The car then burst into flames, killing the two occupants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5yJH4t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There has been much speculation from Tesla’s many interested online observers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8iOon"&gt;The second relevant finding is that NTSB crash investigators tested whether Tesla’s advanced driver assist system Autopilot would work on the part of the road where the crash took place. There has been much speculation from Tesla’s many interested online observers as to whether Autopilot would even function on the road near the crash site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZexsXz"&gt;Using Autopilot requires both the Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (Tesla’s brand name for its adaptive cruise control function) and Autosteer (which assists in lane departure and centering) to work. According to NTSB, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control could be engaged but not Autosteer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54d817"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;Tesla claims&lt;/a&gt; that its own data suggests local officials were mistaken when they reported that the car crashed without someone in the driver’s seat. The company’s executives have stated that the steering wheel was “deformed” and the seatbelts were buckled, leading them to conclude that someone was behind the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIMl4E"&gt;There was some limited data recovered from the crash. NTSB said the fire destroyed the onboard storage device located in the vehicle’s infotainment console. The restraint control module, which records data associated with vehicle speed, belt status, acceleration, and airbag deployment, was recovered but was also damaged by the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="76Vaf4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board likely will not issue its final report on the crash this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt85Nc"&gt;The board likely will not issue its final report on the crash this year. By comparison, the NTSB’s investigation into a California man’s death while using Autopilot in his Tesla Model X took two years to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85ILAL"&gt;The crash took place on Saturday, April 17th, in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators at the scene were “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTr9oR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q8mGj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA5RTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple suppliers linked to Uyghur forced labor in new report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XoKq-dY5VONuf34LH0rcbAS_z6k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264431/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v9l0IJ"&gt;Several Apple suppliers may have used forced labor in China, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fseven-apple-suppliers-accused-of-using-forced-labor-from-xinjiang&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F10%2F22428899%2Fapple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Working with two human rights groups, the publication identified seven companies that supplied products or services to Apple and supported forced labor programs, according to statements made by the Chinese government. The programs target the country’s Muslim minority population, particularly Uyghurs living in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjTPW"&gt;Six of the seven suppliers were said to participate in work programs operated by the Chinese government, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports, which human rights groups describe as frequently offering cover for forced labor. Workers can be jailed for refusing to join the work programs, the report says, and those enrolled in the programs are often moved far from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl0OY3"&gt;One of the suppliers operated in Xinjiang, the region of China predominantly populated by Uyghurs and where the most egregious human rights violations &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/inside-xinjiang-detention-camp"&gt;have reportedly taken place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wL5Jyw"&gt;The companies supplied Apple with antennas, cables, and coatings, among other products and services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glfQLl"&gt;Apple “found no evidence of forced labor anywhere we operate,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. Apple said it looks for forced labor as part of “every assessment” it conducts. “We will continue doing all we can to protect workers and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgJ34z"&gt;The problem is not Apple’s alone. The tech industry at large relies on suppliers in China, and &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reports that these companies have also worked with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, among others. (Amazon and Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; they wouldn’t work with suppliers using forced labor; Google and Microsoft didn’t respond.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeynMT"&gt;China’s forced work programs have been &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;getting more attention&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, with new reports speaking to the growing scope of China’s oppressive practices in Xinjiang. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xinjiang-forced-labor-uyghurs-a3b58b6e-c98f-4ce4-ae52-7b4a37fa61f5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; finding more than 100 detention facilities located beside factories.  In January, &lt;a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/determination-of-the-secretary-of-state-on-atrocities-in-xinjiang/index.html"&gt;the Trump administration said&lt;/a&gt; China was “committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcbbAE"&gt;Apple’s supply chain has previously been linked to forced labor in China. The Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;said a glass supplier&lt;/a&gt; was using forced labor in December; Apple said it had seen no evidence of forced labor. In March, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/shares-of-china-s-ofilm-drop-after-firm-loses-foreign-customer"&gt;cut ties with another supplier&lt;/a&gt; over allegations it was connected to coercive government labor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook wants to make sure you’ve read the article you’re about to share</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68e7momSmK79BvJ29oJAdkeC9SU=/136x0:1756x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264427/E1C5TYUWEAo0YiK.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FaceBook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="80hZFr"&gt;Facebook has announced on Twitter that it will start testing a pop-up that asks users if they’re sure they want to share an article that they haven’t opened. The pop-up will prompt users to read the article, but they can also choose to continue sharing it if they want. A Facebook spokesperson said the test would be rolled out to 6 percent of Android users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pG3uXD"&gt;The pop-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;is similar to Twitter’s&lt;/a&gt;, which it started testing in June 2020. Twitter’s implementation of the feature can be annoying to users (myself included) who have read the article elsewhere and decide to share it when they see it pop up on their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjXWWf"&gt;Facebook says the pop-up is meant to help people be more informed about the articles they share, likely as an attempt to combat the spread of misinformation the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551906/facebook-election-results-misinformation-violence-incitement-trends"&gt;has struggled with in the past&lt;/a&gt;. As the message warns, not opening the article can lead to “missing key facts,” with headlines often not telling the whole story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FRAjeo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, we’re testing a way to promote more informed sharing of news articles. If you go to share a news article link you haven’t opened, we’ll show a prompt encouraging you to open it and read it, before sharing it with others. &lt;a href="https://t.co/brlMnlg6Qg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/brlMnlg6Qg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1391816265891778560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="nqWiLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th 3:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline hackers apologize, promise to ransom less controversial targets in future</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vT3M71"&gt;The group behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;ransomware that took down Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; late last week &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/white-house-creates-task-force-to-deal-with-pipeline-breach?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;has apologized&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences,” claiming that its goal is to make money, not cause societal problems. The group is called DarkSide, and &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-compromise-of-colonial-pipeline-networks"&gt;the FBI has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the group’s malware was responsible for compromising one of the US’s largest fuel pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVx5G2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzzez/colonial-pipeline-hackers-statement-darkside"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the group’s apology was posted to its dark web site. It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8WgclL"&gt;We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, &lt;strong&gt;do not need&lt;/strong&gt; to tie us with a defined government and look for other our motives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph7GhI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIWixH"&gt;From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg1wFa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1391794316507418624"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth&lt;/a&gt;, DarkSide isn’t necessarily associated with a specific nationstate, but it does tend to avoid holding victims for ransom if their systems are running in certain Russian and Eastern European languages (see embedded tweet below). &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/white-house-creates-task-force-to-deal-with-pipeline-breach"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the group is known to speak Russian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IPbZ03"&gt;

    <title>Harley-Davidson spins out LiveWire as its own electric motorcycle brand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kuDm4MSafaLkT7zDmLsYb317Gr4=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264340/harley_davidson_livewire_2497.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AeZiTC"&gt;LiveWire, the first electric motorcycle from Harley-Davidson, will now become its own standalone brand. The Milwaukee-based company announced that it would be spinning out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172421/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-price-ces-2019"&gt;electric motorcycle division&lt;/a&gt; as its own company with a distinct lineup and a tailored retail experience. Harley-Davidson plans to unveil the “first LiveWire branded motorcycle” on July 8th to coincide with the International Motorcycle Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v9piF"&gt;It’s a similar move to how Harley-Davidson approached its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536726/harley-davidson-serial-1-electric-bike-ebike-specs-price"&gt;new electric bicycle company, Serial 1&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that LiveWire continues to benefit from its relationship with its parent company while also forging its own brand identity that is distinct from Harley-Davidson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiBVgY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Harley-Davidson is interested in letting its electrified models stand on their own terms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfsiAO"&gt;It’s a shift from how the company approached its current LiveWire model, in which the Harley-Davidson logo is front and center, while the LiveWire brand is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/14/20692388/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-test-drive"&gt;practically nonexistent&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s a sign that going forward, Harley-Davidson is interested in letting its electrified models stand on their own terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0e2LcZ"&gt;“With the mission to be the most desirable electric motorcycle brand in the world, LiveWire will pioneer the future of motorcycling, for the pursuit of urban adventure and beyond,” Jochen Zeitz, chairman, president, and CEO of Harley-Davidson, said in a statement. “LiveWire also plans to innovate and develop technology that will be applicable to Harley-Davidson electric motorcycles in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oj7upFuTMLjIrIytH908nZF8v08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504479/3_LiveWire_Black_CMYK_PRIMARY_LOCKUP.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SS4KX6"&gt;There’s a new logo and a new “virtual” headquarters, with engineering teams stationed in Silicon Valley and Milwaukee. LiveWire will work with Harley-Davidson dealerships as an independent brand, with a blend of digital and physical retail formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdrrBe"&gt;Asked whether this will include online ordering, a Harley-Davidson spokesperson responded with a cautiously worded statement. “It depends on the state in which you live,” the spokesperson said. “LiveWire is creating a purchase path that allows us to meet the expectations for a digital-first purchase experience, supported by a network of committed dealers that allow customers to choose their path and engagement model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfrJJB"&gt;The question is whether this branding strategy will lead to better sales for Harley-Davidson’s electric models. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-harley-davidson-electricbike-focus/harley-struggles-to-fire-up-new-generation-of-riders-with-electric-bike-debut-idUSKBN1WM10N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s plan to appeal to a younger generation of motorcyclists with the LiveWire was struggling, with most of the preorders coming from older or preexisting customers. Harley-Davidson’s overall sales have been stagnant lately after hitting a low point in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IwDlC"&gt;The problem could be that the price, which starts at $29,799, isn’t that much cheaper than a Tesla Model 3. Dealers told &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;that many younger customers were turned off by the price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVKmE6"&gt;Harley-Davidson is also facing some stiff competition from rivals like Zero Motorcycles, which recently teamed up with power sports manufacturer Polaris on a new lineup of electric-powered ATVs and snowmobiles. And as the broader world of transportation shifts to electric, the company will be under increasing pressure from its shareholders to prove its vision for the future can be profitable. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has run the numbers to see how vloggers open their videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HjqD1R5jYjt_vZXO6oJ4NDaLwUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264132/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2b8UnS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;YouTube has run the numbers&lt;/a&gt; and discovered what greeting its vloggers most use to open videos: “Hey, guys.” Those findings may not be surprising if you’ve watched a lot of YouTube, but the report actually shows a lot more, including what the runners-up are, how greetings have changed in popularity over time, and how video genre affects the most common openings. Let’s just jump into it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRxQVj"&gt;To get these findings, YouTube did quite a bit of data analysis, looking at the auto- and creator-generated captions from over a million videos. YouTube picked videos that had over 20,000 views from channels that had over 20,000 subscribers, so it is worth noting that the results are more reflective of how relatively popular videos open, rather than of every single video on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTOOlBTlhg5z-ukWLhW8C8S7170=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504241/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.05.16_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The runners-up have changed over time, but “Hey, guys” has always been dominant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dNiKuG"&gt;YouTube also breaks down how creators of different genres open their videos. For example, sports videos are way more likely to start with “What’s going on?” while travel videos start with a “Good morning” 9 percent of the time. “Hey, guys” comes in second for opening tech videos, with “Ladies and gentlemen” barely edging it out (though I do prefer &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/i09V6SkVkz8?t=46"&gt;Tom Scott’s&lt;/a&gt; “Ladies, gentlemen, and all in between”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErESGkQHEuG5rtKgeElr11hdpxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504243/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.34.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There sure are some outliers here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KQuBeG"&gt;The article also takes a look at international greetings from Brazilian, French, German, and Mexican creators. Surprisingly, only one has a phrase in the top spot that translates to “Hey, guys,” making it seem like more of an English-speaking opening than a global one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co16-ezXisx7CloZ_d9LidhJ_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504222/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.22.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Coucou tout le monde” is how I’m greeting everyone from now on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CBHviN"&gt;To play around with the interactive timeline of greetings for yourself (and get a look at some famous channel openings from the infamous “Hey VSauce, Michael here” to “What’s up, Greg?”), you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/articles/hey-guys/"&gt;head over to YouTube’s article&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it’ll do a breakdown of how people end their videos next so I can get a good idea of how I should be ending these blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>State attorneys general pressure Facebook to abandon plans for children’s Instagram</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ET5Q-lbn2IAyfCbW4-NKQg9HliI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69264000/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XMGgWR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20702192-naag-letter-to-facebook-on-ig-kids"&gt;In an open letter today&lt;/a&gt;, the National Association of Attorneys General called on Facebook to abandon plans for an Instagram platform focused on children under the age of 13. The letter is signed by 44 different state-level attorneys general (including non-states like Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands), representing a majority of US territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0WW96"&gt;“It appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one, as this platform appeals primarily to children who otherwise do not or would not have an Instagram account,” the letter reads. “The attorneys general urge Facebook to abandon its plans to launch this new platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5bXMO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The attorneys general urge Facebook to abandon its plans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvUicq"&gt;Plans for the child-focused Instagram were &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt; in March&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently confirmed by the company. But while internal emails reported by &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt; identified the project as a company priority, Facebook insisted at the time that there was no specific timeline for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWUcOm"&gt;While the letter has no formal legal power, it emphasizes the significant legal risk Facebook will face in undertaking the project. In the US, children under 13 are subject to enhanced legal protections under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (or COPPA), which places particularly stringent rules against data collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFVU2E"&gt;Social networks have traditionally complied with the act by banning users under the age of 13, but it has not entirely protected them from regulatory action. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules"&gt;Google agreed to pay $170 million&lt;/a&gt; after a Federal Trade Commission investigation about the company’s data collection from YouTube videos featuring children’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp4N5k"&gt;State attorneys general have been particularly active in the enforcement of COPPA protections, so the NAAG letter carries with it an implicit legal threat: if Facebook proceeds with its plans for an Instagram for kids, these same attorneys general will be watching very closely for COPPA violations and will be eager to file suit over any violations they find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prhWfv"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook said it would not sell ads on any Instagram app targeted at young children but did not back off on its interest in developing the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTtfBm"&gt;“We’ve just started exploring a version of Instagram for kids,” said Facebook policy representative Andy Stone. “We agree that any experience we develop must prioritize their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it. We also look forward to working with legislators and regulators, including the nation’s attorneys general. In addition, we commit today to not showing ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird is reportedly taking its electric scooter company public via SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V8hOL9zo0YMpah5ab9ZRNaKGxPo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69263773/vpavic_190730_3572_0055.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs57Pj"&gt;Bird, the electric scooter company that helped launch the global micromobility boom, is planning to go public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dot.la/bird-ipo-2652932971.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;dot.LA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bird is merging with &lt;a href="https://swbk2.com/"&gt;Switchback II Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, a Dallas-based “blank check” company focusing on companies reducing carbon emissions, according to documents reviewed by the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Y3I2h"&gt;Bird is the latest transportation company, but one of only a few e-scooter companies, to go public. A record number of companies have gone public this past year by merging with SPAC shell corporations, which avoids the scrutiny of a traditional IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s9pVxG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bird is the latest transportation company, but one of only a few e-scooter companies, to go public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x5yNeC"&gt;Reports first surfaced last November of Bird’s SPAC ambitions, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/scooter-startup-bird-is-said-to-discuss-going-public-via-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;after &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Santa Monica-based company was working with Credit Suisse to find a potential partner. Spokespersons for Bird and Switchback II Corporation did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcfRbP"&gt;The deal will net Bird hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, which it can use to fund its operations as it continues to chase profitability. Scooter sharing is a cash intensive business, with companies routinely spending more on each scooter than they take in with revenue. Very few companies operating scooter fleets have succeeded in turning a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9LqFX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;dot.LA&lt;/em&gt;, which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has gotten a look at the pitch deck, has more details about the transaction: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vspn85"&gt;The transaction values Bird at $2.3 billion, below the $2.85 billion valuation it reached in the beginning of 2020. But that was before the pandemic, which drove 2020 revenue down to $95 million, a 37 percent decline from 2019, according to a deck pitching the deal seen by dot.LA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OdOyeb"&gt;Bird first launched its scooter sharing service in Santa Monica in September 2017. Since then, it has grown to over 100 cities, facilitated over 10 million rides, and raised cash at an unprecedented pace. It has the distinction of being the fastest startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17634330/bird-electric-scooter-sharing-paris-tel-aviv"&gt;to achieve a $2 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8upTWB"&gt;But the pandemic has taken a serious toll on the company. Bird saw its ridership numbers plummet at the onset of the lockdown last spring. Last March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231802/bird-electric-scooter-company-workplace-culture-layoffs"&gt;the company laid off over 400 employees&lt;/a&gt; in a now infamous Zoom call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e4Rbco"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But as lockdowns ease and customers return to scooter sharing, Bird’s woes continue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1O8Hi7"&gt;But as lockdowns ease and customers return to scooter sharing, Bird’s woes continue. The company was snubbed by a number of major cities issuing permits to scooter operators, including Chicago, Paris, and San Francisco. Bird was recently selected to participate in New York City’s inaugural scooter program — a decision that may have helped buoy the company’s long-term financial prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhZWav"&gt;Bird has grown increasingly reliant on revenue from its franchising program, in which the company sells its older scooters to small operators and takes a cut of each ride. The program, which is called Bird Platform, has led some operators to fall into deep debt, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/bird-is-quietly-luring-contract-workers-into-debt-through-a-new-scooter-scheme-3fa34fb4a0f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company has since launched Bird Platform in countries like Switzerland and Estonia, cheering investors who hope it will lower Bird’s labor and capital expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYb8iV"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/after-tough-year-spacs-tempt-bird-lime&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332624/bird-europe-investment-scooter-expansion-new-hires&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22096665__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Bird was nearing a deal to raise more than $100 million in convertible debt from some of its existing investors. The debt, which could eventually be converted into stock, would help Bird avoid selling shares at a lower price than in earlier fundraising rounds. But the company has yet to disclose whether that deal has gone through. &lt;/p&gt;
