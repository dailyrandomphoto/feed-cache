    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;This year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKAXTh"&gt;Currently, the 3rd-gen Echo Dot gets frequent price drops, and right now you can get it for $25 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725321348360875873" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54148143&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. That deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen/dp/B08LX6M79Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is by far the most adorable smart speaker on the market right now. The Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version, but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audio books and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now, you can get this device for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LY7VXZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you purchase it on Amazon, you can also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo also includes a sphere-shape design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;If you are looking for just one Amazon Echo, it is down to its lowest price ever of $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo from Amazon, you also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HtqAa"&gt;If you are looking for two Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $140&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $60 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device for at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GGyBnu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;Last year, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itnaQP"&gt;Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYZJ868?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds, plus six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited, for just $80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product you may want to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no active deals right now for a new Echo Studio, but you can get it right now for its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There is, however a deal on a bundle at Best Buy, which includes a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725326053000014488" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio and a Fire TV Stick 4K for $230&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Health care is coming to grips with its pollution problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An ambulance drives down a road in Brooklyn on December 01, 2020 in New York City.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16NbqPvK7BvkE1_DqfM4F0klQHk=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68472975/1288910280.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ukc6hl"&gt;Pollution from the health care industry is harming the communities it serves, says a study published today in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you count up how many fewer healthy years people in the US lived as a result of all the pollution the industry pumped out in 2018, it would add up to a collective sum of 388,000 years, the research found. That’s similar to the number of years of life lost due to preventable medical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j86AaO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m putting a bandaid on a bullet wound”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wBFkX3"&gt;“I feel like I’m putting a bandaid on a bullet wound,” says Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and lead author of another article also published in &lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt; today that urges health care policymakers to consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;threats posed by climate change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zj1hwm"&gt;Salas is already seeing the effects in her practice, from older adults suffering from heat strokes to patients struggling to breathe because of pollution and &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/climate-change-and-allergies/#:~:text=Burning%20fossil%20fuels%20releases%20carbon,can%20make%20allergy%20symptoms%20worse."&gt;seasonal allergies&lt;/a&gt; that have gotten worse as the planet heats up. “I can try to open their lungs back up with treatments in the emergency department,” Salas said. “But then I send them back out into the very same environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8eTOX"&gt;The problem is only growing over time, with greenhouse gas emissions from health care rising 6 percent between 2010 and 2018. That’s why health care providers are increasing pressure on their industry to tackle its environmental footprint. The new research is part of an entire December issue of &lt;em&gt;Health Affairs&lt;/em&gt; dedicated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;climate change and public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rX5mEX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Health care makes up 8.5 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwqeF1"&gt;Overall, health care makes up 8.5 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions. The biggest source of health care pollution was its supply chain, which accounted for 82 percent of health care-associated emissions. That means the way medicines, medical supplies, and equipment are made could be contributing to pollution that’s making people sick. The numbers in the study on greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollutants are estimates based on how much money health systems spent on goods and services. Since this method doesn’t account for gases used for anesthesia that escape operating rooms, the true environmental footprint could be even larger. Anesthetic gases are &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/anesthesia-greenhouse-gas/"&gt;even more potent&lt;/a&gt; than carbon dioxide when it comes to heating up the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXCjQR"&gt;Instead of simply sending patients back out to an unhealthy environment, health care providers need to step up and eventually eliminate their contributions to climate change, Salas tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Salas and the authors of the emissions study both recommend that Medicaid offer incentives to health care providers to cut down pollution. Medicaid reimbursements, for example, could be tied to climate efforts in the same way they were tied to efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690142/"&gt;desegregate hospitals&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s. The emissions study also recommends mandating that health care systems report on how much pollution they’re generating and make plans to cut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqNUmO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The health care system should be the first.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNNTxs"&gt;England is the only country in the world that mandates reporting already, according to the study. In October, England’s National Health Service declared that it would become the first national system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497815/uk-nhs-national-health-service-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change"&gt;to slash emissions to net zero&lt;/a&gt; by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzENfn"&gt;“I personally believe that the health care system should be the first to try to reach net zero [carbon dioxide emissions] because we have to practice what we preach,” Salas says. The global economy needs to get to net zero emissions — a combination of cutting down pollution as much as possible and then offsetting whatever is left — by the middle of the century to avoid the worst effects of climate change, according to climate scientists. “Climate action is a prescription for health; we have to lead and fulfill that prescription for our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtH1Gq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLjek2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mXAcFi"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, usually costing $90. Released in 2019, this base Kindle model includes a front light, comes in one storage configuration of 8GB, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=08c9fedb17174c7a7fe940944cd78418&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which is $120 ($15 off its usual price), and it includes a printed cover and a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of this device, as it allows parents to grant access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $128&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-generation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8PKNl"&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CXG6C9W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724858487720989771" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have discounted the fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite 8GB model with ad-support, bringing its retail price down to $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJrHrN"&gt;Amazon has also knocked $20 off its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKWNVSD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=261395a0382ce2c0aecf3c9f9e099dcc&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKX97CR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=3a5cb4645a5b1f86f9b8e704cc584654&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt; Paperwhite (with ads), plus a leather cover and a power adapter. If you are a fan of &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; book series, the e-commerce giant has four bundles that include the Paperwhite (with ads) and exclusive covers designed by the series’ author, plus a power adapter for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 if you buy the 8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Oasis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations: 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are no deals on just the Oasis itself, Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087YZGRGQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=e940143295b150503dca7aa3985b2fd5&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z7Z3DF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=7b5fe424246439c89a69b3302267e073&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also include a leather cover, a power adapter, plus three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D0nXc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 best games for your new Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21012569/nintendo-switch-best-games-2019-pokemon-zelda"},{"title":"The best games of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21126558/best-games-2020-ps4-ps5-xbox-nintendo-switch-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hKnMOF"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons/dp/B084DDDNRP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=9a44240b76583966c44a81aba7e7c185&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21116081/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-unique-joy-con-colors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;-themed Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; consoles. Unlike the regular Switch, this model has a few standout features that make it one of the best-looking Switch models to date. It includes pastel green and blue Joy-Con, a white dock adorned with images of the Nook family, and the back of the Switch has an embossed design with little icons associated with the game.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="pbWPDc"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowto&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dnintendo%2Bswitch%26lang%3Ddefault" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1720139703165212912" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; receive new supplies of the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite consoles fairly regularly, and it’s a good strategy to keep these pages open so you can quickly add one to your cart when they come back in stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lwy57E"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=as_li_ss_tl?node=16227130011&amp;amp;pf&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=cdc1feec68a340047fb6e28d4e61c5b9&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has been sold out of the regular Switch for a while now and is usually among one of the first retailers to sell out when new stock arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUJLvUA3JhGEkMaXYRnoetEh8aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21940650/nintendo_switch_animal_crossing_new_horizons_edition.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special edition Animal Crossing Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out GameStop. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veAGHSQdVpomFEThPomQmjmS1bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070145/jbareham_1492_170228_0275.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $75&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $46&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yrravQwglpzWOC1tZVT479bwzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UL8Rr"&gt;Of course, there are also third-party options to choose from, especially if you liked the GameCube controller’s design. Amazon is currently running a deal that allows you to buy &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qu1XX6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three of PowerA’s wireless game controllers for $70&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great deal, especially if you plan to play multiplayer games like &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-429" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $129 or $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725328034162471061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724675251539044953" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-23" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon, which has the Apple’s flagship earbuds for $199&lt;/a&gt;. If that deal sells out, you can currently get them at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo for $220&lt;/a&gt; or for $234 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724966188075813300" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at the Watch SE, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. But for those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Watch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2TkUJkurmgX8ZHUE8HnJGYxv-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9693867/akrales_171113_2119_0045.jpg"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal itself. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is  $179 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=0d1a72f49279f5c3ff832b7b9721e419&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725327349047065530" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for its normal price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K387Y7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725899747014446199" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have knocked $20 off the pricing of its black model, bringing it down to $209 ($20 off). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GXmAb3"&gt;A current deal available for the Apple Watch SE is the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900256762314827" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm size with GPS for $259&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off) at Best Buy. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900395414293919" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm with GPS is also on sale for $20&lt;/a&gt; off at Best Buy, bringing the price down to $289.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhhPdM"&gt;If you are looking for the GPS and cellular configuration, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900657775317077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has the 40mm size for $309&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for the 44mm size (plus cellular) Amazon has select colors on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-Cellular-44mm/dp/B08J5SFGQQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $320 (usually $359) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or you can buy this model at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900565456393275" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $339&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The latest high-end model of the Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect the blood oxygen levels in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

Best Buy also has a sale on the 40mm &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900844461171213" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series 6, knocking $30 off&lt;/a&gt; its normal retail price of $399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMKKL1"&gt;Amazon has the 44mm size (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5V1YWL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white only&lt;/a&gt;) for $399, which is how much the 40mm size normally costs.

    <title>Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review: noise-canceling champion</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Good sound quality and best-in-class noise cancellation come in an awkwardly big case&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AWRAyO"&gt;Bose’s original true wireless earbuds, the SoundSport Free, sounded fantastic but were foiled by connectivity problems and audio / video sync issues that the company never fully resolved. They also lacked active noise cancellation, which is the feature that Bose built its entire brand around. This allowed Apple, Sony, and others to seize the market with products like the AirPods Pro and WF-1000XM3 earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWYsbq"&gt;But Bose is tired of ceding ground to its competitors, and it’s returned with the QuietComfort Earbuds. Thanks to their completely redone design, the QuietComfort Earbuds are free from the frustrations that came with the SoundSport Free buds. They still sound terrific — and now, they’ve got ANC. It took Bose a while to get here, but the QuietComfort Earbuds deliver the best noise cancellation you can get in true wireless earbuds right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KAf2tu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9517646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpuVm8"&gt;The big question is how much that’s worth to you. At $279, the QuietComfort Earbuds are a $30 increase over the AirPods Pro and in striking distance of Sennheiser’s $300 Momentum True Wireless 2. And while Bose has avoided any inherent flaws with the earbuds themselves, there are still minor annoyances like an awkwardly large carrying case and limited onboard controls that lack much customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EAQJY"&gt;At 0.3 ounces (8.5 grams) each, the QuietComfort Earbuds weigh about the same as Sony’s 1000XM3 buds in the ear, but the AirPods Pro (0.19 ounces, 5.4 grams) have them beat for all-day comfort. Bose’s earbuds are also larger than the AirPods Pro in every dimension and stick out further from the ear — though not to the same silly degree as the SoundSport Free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds next to the Apple AirPods Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xp7wo8Nybo4rSmbfEqlbLFJPvFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946558/IMG_0719-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are smaller and lighter than the QuietComfort Earbuds, but their noise cancellation isn’t as good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qshKMy"&gt;But even if they’re not the most discreet or svelte, the QuietComfort Earbuds still feel very good in my ears, thanks to Bose’s StayHear Max ear tips, which have an integrated, flexible silicone wing that tucks into the ridge of the ear for added stability. Both the medium and large-sized ear tips worked for me and created a tight seal, but I ultimately found that mixing the two led to the best extended comfort. (There’s a reason manufacturers suggest trying that!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXxTDN"&gt;Once they’re in place, the QuietComfort Earbuds aren’t going anywhere, and I’d be confident taking them for a run or through an intense gym routine. They’re rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, so sweat and the occasional splash of water should be fine, but avoid rainstorms. One thing worth mentioning is the occlusion effect; since Bose didn’t go for a vented design like the AirPods Pro or Pixel Buds with natural airflow, if you have a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tight seal with the QuietComfort Earbuds in, your inside voice might sound louder than normal, and in silent environments, you can hear yourself breathing. I noticed this when I first started using them, but it’s since gone away — either because the fit changed slightly or I’ve gotten used to it. Some people are more sensitive to this stuff than others. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds case next to cases for the AirPods, Pixel Buds, Powerbeats Pro, and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m28qW_kthuHo3SjzMrnXmG3-1Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946564/IMG_0725-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s case is substantially thicker than charging cases for many other true wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWYmqh"&gt;The charging case for the QuietComfort Earbuds is… &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. It’s nowhere near as compact as the AirPods Pro case or the cases for Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus or Google’s Pixel Buds. (The aforementioned Sennheisers also win out here.) I realize this is mostly due to the Bose earbuds’ larger size, but it still makes for an awkward bulge in whatever pants pocket you put them in. The case’s chonk factor isn’t a deal-breaker for me, as I always have a backpack with me for stowing it in. But at twice the thickness of an AirPods case, it could be for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBDBKg"&gt;Opening the case is more of a process than usual since Bose put in a latch that you’ve got to release by pressing the button on front. This takes firmer pressure than expected and can get annoying at times. On the plus side, you won’t have to worry about your pricey earbuds skittering across the floor if you drop the case. The front of the case has five LEDs to indicate battery charge level; Bose estimates up to six hours of continuous listening time for the earbuds themselves, plus two additional charges from the case. Those numbers are all very par for the course. The case supports wireless charging and has a USB-C port if you prefer to plug in for faster top-offs. (Fifteen minutes of charging can give you two hours of playback time.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHFzFF"&gt;Bose retakes the noise cancellation crown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SYmldI"&gt;The audio quality and noise cancellation of the QuietComfort Earbuds easily outweigh the headaches from dealing with their awkward case. Bose has taken a noticeable lead over competitors and is nearing the noise cancellation effectiveness of full-size headphones. Instead of a simple on / off toggle like the AirPods Pro, Bose lets you choose between 10 levels of noise canceling. At 10, these earbuds do an astonishing job of hushing the world around you — better than Apple, Sony, and other competitors. Street noise just fades away; the constant hum of an air conditioner or the whir of a fan all but disappears. I’m not traveling much by plane at the moment, but I’m certain these would do a better job at muting cabin noise than other earbuds. You can even use the QuietComfort Earbuds in noise-canceling mode even when there’s no audio playing if you’re just looking for some peace and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds on a table beside the carrying case." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GX7Eavn5STJHPP8dHUF-M_SfkR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946562/IMG_0722-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ear tips have an integrated silicone fin for added stability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QqXfoe"&gt;On the opposite end, dropping down to zero puts the earbuds into full transparency / ambient mode. Bose has managed to tie Apple at making it &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; feel like you’re not wearing earbuds at all. The transparency mode on the QuietComfort Earbuds sounds incredibly natural and will appeal to people who want a better sense of their surroundings when outside. When you take out either earbud, the one in your other ear automatically goes into full transparency — since Bose figures you’re probably trying to hear something. (Music also automatically pauses when an earbud is removed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7472BI"&gt;You can double tap on the left earbud to switch between three “favorite” levels of noise cancellation. The defaults are 10, 5, and zero. I didn’t see any need to switch those up, but you can set them to whatever you want in the Bose Music app. Bose also lets you choose your preferred action for a long-press of the left bud: it can either announce battery status or skip to the next song. Unfortunately, that’s where customization of the controls end. These are the controls you’re left with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mCG8Zc"&gt;Double tap on the right earbud to play or pause audio / answer a phone call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7KcPih"&gt;Touch and hold the right earbud to activate Siri or Google Assistant / decline a phone call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wlVhTx"&gt;Double tap on the left earbud to switch between noise cancellation presets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qgtl4g"&gt;Long press on the left earbud to check battery level or skip to the next song&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BoxATS"&gt;Swipe up or down on the right earbud to increase or lower volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="A5dZKh"&gt;Bose introduced the onboard volume controls a couple months after the QuietComfort Earbuds originally shipped, and you’ve got to enable them in the Bose Music app before you can use them — otherwise nothing will happen. I haven’t had any problems with the swipes to adjust loudness, so it’s a nice addition. There’s still no way of going back to the last song with the earbud controls, however. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds pictured worn in a person’s right ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CZLiRPQ8WlHTi_Dg75ZbCnB_Os4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946555/IMG_0717-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QuietComfort Earbuds don’t stick out of your ear as far as Bose’s previous SoundSport Free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0iMseF"&gt;In my time testing the QuietComfort Earbuds, connection stability between the buds and my phone has been mostly flawless. Maybe that’s the result of upgrading to Bluetooth 5.1 or other internal changes, but either way, it’s a major improvement over the SoundSport Free, which suffered frequent audio dropouts. That’s not a concern this time around. Nor did I notice any audio / video sync mismatches when watching content from YouTube, Netflix, or Prime Video on my phone and laptop. Bose has successfully tackled the main flaws of its original true wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="G6Rq2L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9517686"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46EVb1"&gt;Sound quality is still top notch. Bose isn’t shy about sculpting the audio; the company’s Active EQ boosts low and high frequencies at lower volumes so that music still feels dynamic even when you’re not cranking it. The QuietComfort Earbuds are very bass-forward and pack a wallop for hip-hop and EDM tracks. But the powerful low end also translates well to other genres. To my ears, these have a wider, richer soundstage than the competition (perhaps with the exception of Sennheiser). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the ear tips for Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CiGkcHYKo8zt8mG5oB4QAfbxu_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946556/IMG_0718-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three sizes of ear tips come in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the microphones on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilaZtseGmb2hV2Ryhgp-Ql0o_a4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946557/IMG_0726-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An array of microphones help the QuietComfort Earbuds pull off their fantastic noise cancellation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnyHnq"&gt;Regardless of what genre you’re playing, the highs are detailed without ever coming off as harsh or shrill. Unfortunately, Bose’s app doesn’t offer any way to adjust the EQ for people who don’t love the default sound signature. Custom EQ is an option on the over-ear Noise Canceling Headphones 700, so it’s a bummer not to see it on these premium earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO9YEh"&gt;The QuietComfort Buds also handle voice calls well. They have a “self voice” feature that lets you adjust how much you can hear your own voice on a call so you don’t end up speaking too loudly, and they do a nice job of picking up your voice and reducing background noise so that others can clearly hear you. Only the right earbud can be used standalone for calls and audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-vCgZO9eA3I4L0V5utP4EF7-oQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946563/IMG_0723-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case provides two additional charges (12 hours) of battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSG9Pk"&gt;Unfortunately, Bose didn’t include multipoint in these earbuds, so they can only pair with one device at a time. Simultaneous pairing is still rare for earbuds — and a unique strength for Jabra — but when you consider that Apple’s AirPods Pro can now automatically and instantly switch between Apple devices, the QuietComfort Earbuds definitely take a usability hit. Multipoint is a longtime feature on Bose’s headphones, but for whatever reason, the company’s engineers couldn’t make it work here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qSCLN7"&gt;So yes, Bose’s new, almost-$300 QuietComfort Earbuds still have downsides. The earbuds are on the larger side, and their case is an absolute unit. They lack multipoint. But there’s also plenty of good: Bose has leap-frogged everyone in noise cancellation (establishing itself as a leader once again) and come up with great-sounding earbuds that work reliably. Once the world is back to office life and boarding planes regularly, I think that’ll be a compelling combo — assuming you’re not already carrying around a pair of AirPods Pro or Sony 1000XM3s, that is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0dNC7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th 2:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The review has been updated to reflect the new onboard volume controls that Bose added to the QuietComfort Earbuds after their release. The overall score remains unchanged. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the most affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Sometimes, there just isn’t a deal happening. In that case, we’ve mentioned how much the most recent sale price was for, so you know when to take the plunge. But most of the time, there’s some sort of deal going on, be it on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, you’ll find it mentioned with any and all context you need to hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the tablet with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Right now, Amazon and Best Buy have a ton of deals on Apple’s most affordable tablet. You can buy the base model, which includes 32GB of storage and supports WiFi only for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725891876032187286" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEPjki"&gt;If you want more storage, you can get the 128GB of storage model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J61NFNR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$380 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725892081629772202" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, carrying forth the same 7.9-inch display and design from previous iterations with refreshed internal specs within. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini with Wi-Fi support, set at $400 and $500, respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display and features thinner bezels around the display and has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. However, the model that also supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;If you’re looking for the latest iPad model, B&amp;amp;H Photo has select colors on sale. You can get the 64GB configuration in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594485-REG%2Fapple_myfn2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Silver for only $569&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594484-REG%2Fapple_myfm2ll_a_10_9_ipad_airwi_fi_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Space Gray model for $579&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oBFocq"&gt;If you don’t mind the last generation model, Best Buy is discounting the 3rd Gen 2019 iPad Air by &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958762425958680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 off for the 64GB model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $430.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the one that came in 2018, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less-expensive models, this one ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also has Face ID to unlock instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and has a high refresh display. The iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, and that comes through in the price. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Master Chief is a DJ cat in Taika Waititi’s Xbox short film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K930kUXqXXNlcfcz9Msi3bdXKio=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471878/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_9.47.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uewjAM"&gt;Microsoft’s marketing tagline for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is “Power Your Dreams,” and the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dQldgaMtdNg"&gt;newest Xbox ad&lt;/a&gt;, a short film by &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; director Taika Waititi, takes the tagline to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZewOep"&gt;The ad takes place in a “dream incubation lab,” where a woman plays an Xbox Series X before being guided into a dream state. She then explains her dreams, featuring things like a neon-outlined bunny hopping through a forest and a flying whale in space, all of which appear on-screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMWBVn"&gt;That’s pretty standard dream stuff, if you ask me. But eventually, the woman dreams that a giant Master Chief in space DJs using an entire &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ring. That would be enough to solidify this as a pretty odd commercial, but the woman then reveals that Master Chief is, in fact, a cat, and then cat-Chief takes off his helmet and starts dancing. I can’t say I’ve ever dreamed anything quite like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeFtCc"&gt;If you ask me, though, the ad fits right in with some of the others Microsoft has used to help promote its new consoles. One, released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, featured actor Daniel Kaluuya flying through ever-changing virtual worlds. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150065/microsoft-holiday-2020-commercial-dogs-halo-minecraft-flight-simulator"&gt;holiday commercial&lt;/a&gt; features dogs dreaming that they are dropping grenades at Master Chief’s feet and playing &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; together. Maybe Master Chief actually being a DJ cat isn’t so weird after all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest Pixel feature drop adds even more battery optimizations and Adaptive Sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7UHP-04rqgeqYRjUjrzUYv_jBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471519/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AcS1vl"&gt;Google’s latest Pixel feature drop, where the company brings a slew of new software tricks to its smartphone lineup, is being announced today. Alongside some brand-new functionality like Adaptive Sound, which “improves the sound quality of your phone speaker based on your surroundings,” the December drop is also bringing many of the latest software features from the Pixel 5, 4A 5G, and 4A to older devices; Google says the Pixel 3 and newer will be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNJH7E"&gt;That means features like Hold for Me, where the Google Assistant waits for a real person to hop on the customer support line instead of making &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; do it, and others like Extreme Battery Saver mode and screen sharing on Duo calls will soon hit older devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ARbAYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5 review: new phone, old tricks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"},{"title":"Google Pixel 4A 5G review: more than just a bigger budget phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"},{"title":"Google Pixel 4A review: back to basics for $349","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dtU84j"&gt;Extreme Battery Saver seemed like an over-correction from the company after last year’s Pixel 4 and 4 XL got average (at best) battery life; this year’s Pixels all have great endurance, and most people will never need to consider using it. But Extreme Battery Saver, which “only runs the essentials so your battery lasts as long as possible,” definitely makes more sense on those Pixel 4, 3A, and 3 devices as their batteries continue to age.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6j1UgesFZc6r1gsvVGXom5LZq90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150452/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_9.44.50_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The helpful Hold for Me feature from the 2020 Pixel lineup is coming to older models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cZHbVt"&gt;Several Pixel phones receiving this feature drop will be getting a new feature to preserve the battery’s long-term health: Adaptive Charging. Similar to the implementations we’ve seen from other smartphone makers, Google says Adaptive Charging “helps preserve battery health over time by dynamically controlling how quickly a Pixel device charges” when plugged in overnight. This is coming to Pixels 4 and newer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg9PIM"&gt;And the company’s first 5G-capable phones, the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G, will now default to using 4G for simple tasks like web browsing and texting, but they will flip on the 5G connection for streaming movies or watching large files. That sounds familiar to the system Apple has in place for the iPhone 12 series, though Google notes this “Adaptive Connectivity” feature isn't available on all carriers or for all apps. Like in Apple’s case, you’ll be able to turn it off if you prefer full 5G speeds at all times when there’s a signal. (Google also says the GPS accuracy on the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G is improved after this update.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VU0O4lDZi0rXXGRmwUJXfS490Ag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150428/E805_PhotosGifs_Video01_v03_Twitter.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel phones are first to get new suggestions in Google Photos to enhance sky photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MzoRCL"&gt;Pixel owners will also find new suggestions in Google Photos, including “Dynamic, which enhances brightness, contrast and color, and a set of sky suggestions, which help you create stunning sunset and sunrise images in just one tap.” For now, it sounds like those options are Pixel-exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxyllSTKCjmLBYRCWU0OMrKhq-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150462/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_9.47.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adaptive sound uses your Pixel’s microphone to tune the speaker quality for whatever room you’re in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UdKYcS"&gt;As for that interesting Adaptive Sound trick, which seems like an attempt to improve the Pixel 5’s mediocre speaker output, it “uses the microphone to assess the acoustics near you, then adjusts the sound equalizer settings in certain apps.” So the phone will tune audio differently in your bathroom compared to the bedroom. Consider me skeptical that this will fix one of the Pixel 5’s few hardware downsides, but we’ll see. Google notes that “all microphone data” recorded for speaker optimization is deleted shortly after being recorded, and the company says this feature always runs locally on your device and doesn’t send any audio to the cloud. Adaptive Sound is only coming to the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bPL6i"&gt;And last, the home screen on Pixel phones is getting more customizable with this update. You’ll be able to choose “new icons, grid views, and app shapes” as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmZx2qlPpi0V3tZHLUNde5Ip8oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150418/Screenshot_20201204_161411.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen on Pixels is getting more customizable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AERqDf"&gt;All of this, plus smaller stuff like the option to export the Pixel’s “Now Playing” automatic music recognition to a YouTube Music playlist, will roll out as part of the December feature drop beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Co9i8F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 7th, 2:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article original stated that the Pixel 3A and newer would receive the new Adaptive Charging feature. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87395744"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s table on this page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; clarifies that it’s only coming to the Pixel 4 and newer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
