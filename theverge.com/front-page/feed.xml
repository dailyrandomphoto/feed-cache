    <title>Bose’s new SoundLink Flex speaker has a rugged design and ‘astonishing’ sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1j9AV2SEpvuuG-0SlM9Q5KoFA8=/0x0:1385x923/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988678/Large_JPG_SLFBS_StoneBlue_0004_RGB.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TQPIB"&gt;Bose is introducing its first new portable Bluetooth speaker in quite a while. The $149 &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/pressroom/featured/soundlink_flex_bluetooth_speaker.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundLink Flex&lt;/a&gt; has a ruggedized design with an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, 12-hour battery life, and what Bose claims is “astonishing” audio performance for its size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTsjKG"&gt;At 7.9 inches wide, 3.6 inches high, 2.1 inches deep, and weighing slightly over one pound, the SoundLink Flex is nicely compact and has a built-in utility loop for attaching to a carabiner. It’ll be sold in three colors: there’s black, smoke white, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTHocw"&gt;Inside the SoundLink Flex is a custom transducer that Bose says is “as big as could fit” and capable of producing “bass that you can feel in your chest.” Using a feature that Bose calls “PositionIQ,” the speaker can detect what orientation its in — upright, hanging, or flat on its back — and tune audio output accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/as8hJjVPfsoPXe6NCoOamt8DGfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923469/Large_JPG_SLFBS_Black_0280_RGB.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speaker is designed to withstand the elements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6eDLoA"&gt;The speaker has a silicone back and powder-coated steel grille, and Bose claims it’s designed to resist corrosion and fend off any discoloration from UV light. With that IP67 rating, it’s a pool-safe speaker, and Bose says it’ll float to the surface when dropped into water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q48L61"&gt;There’s nothing particularly “smart” about the SoundLink Flex, but it can be linked up with any Bose smart speakers or soundbars you’ve got at home. And you can stereo pair it with another SoundLink Flex or a different Bose portable speaker. There’s also a built-in microphone for taking calls and interacting with the voice assistant on your phone. (Bose still sells the much pricier Portable Smart Speaker for $400 with built-in voice capabilities.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YybCtn_xw59-9KulHGF9JKkonQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923499/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_9.43.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controls are located at the top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w3vekH"&gt;At $149, the SoundLink undercuts products like the Sonos Roam, though it doesn’t match that speaker’s wide set of features. But Bose’s portable speakers have a way of sounding much better than you’d expect based on their size, so I’m looking forward to hearing what the SoundLink Flex is capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition laptop uses eye-tracking cameras for a glasses-free 3D display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SzP9zSjJVlMXSPyBLCrTKJ76fyE=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988540/ConceptD_7_SpatialLabs_Edition_CN715_73G_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BtWws"&gt;Acer is finally bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro"&gt;glasses-free 3D SpatialLabs tech&lt;/a&gt; to a laptop you can buy: the company has officially announced the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L6hfTo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Acer’s new SpatialLabs tech brings 3D content to laptop screens","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OPdIS9"&gt;Announced earlier this year, SpatialLabs combines a suite of hardware and software features. These features include a special stereo camera with two sensors that track your eyes and head, an optical lens on the display that refracts the two slightly different images to your eyes, and rendering software that adjusts the 3D images in real time as you move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylCGQG"&gt;As part of its ConceptD lineup of products for designers and developers, Acer’s pitch here is that the 3D display will allow for users to see 3D projects for CAD designs, 3D printing, architecture, or animation in three dimensions, instead of trying to approximate things on a 2D screen. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Monica Chin got to try out the hardware earlier this year and called it “quite impressive,” even if the actual usefulness of the technology still remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z0JmW9lB68-K2gx6RYOvqVe8xH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923500/ConceptD_7_SpatialLabs_Edition_CN715_73G_Lifestyle_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer imagines developers using the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition as a design tool alongside larger displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BlsWka"&gt;Of course, a 3D display is nothing without 3D content, and Acer is providing a few tools out of the box, like the SpatialLabs Model Viewer, which allows you to import 3D files from apps like Autodesk Fusion 360, Rhinoceros, and ZBrush. It also says that it’s working with developers on more integrated solutions for the future, although the limited availability of the tech to this single laptop (so far) means that rollout will likely be slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1fQrt"&gt;The company is also offering a SpatialLabs Go app, with AI enhancements that Acer says will allow you to convert 2D content (including “videos, images, simple games, and the webcam feed of participants during a video conference or video call”) to stereoscopic 3D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5r5Ni"&gt;Fancy 3D tricks aside, the rest of the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition is a top-tier laptop (it has to be, in order to accomplish all the real-time rendering and 3D modeling for which Acer envisions it being used). While Acer isn’t offering exact configurations yet, it can be configured with Intel Core i7-11800H processors, up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM (which is user upgradable to up to 64GB), an Nvidia RTX 3080, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. There’s only a single display option, naturally: a 15.6-inch LCD panel that offers 3840 x 2160 resolution in 2D mode or 1920 x 2160 in 3D mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M5dMd"&gt;That kind of hardware doesn’t come cheap, though: Acer says that the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition will launch in December in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa starting at an eye-watering €3,599 (or about $4,160.32). It’ll also be available in North America sometime in 2022, but the exact price and release date haven’t been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OCxJfKDjTJTCN_wQF1vBZpVrZLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923502/ConceptD_3_Ezel_CC315_73_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new ConceptD 3 Ezel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c9EeNZ"&gt;Acer is also updating its other ConceptD 3 laptops today: the clamshell ConceptD 3 and ConceptD 3 Pro are getting new 16-inch displays with 16:10 aspect ratios, in addition to a new 15.6-inch convertible ConceptD 3 Ezel and ConceptD 3 Ezel (which brings the existing hinge design that Acer has offered on its convertible laptops to a more affordable price point). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz1v7m"&gt;The 16-inch ConceptD 3 and ConceptD 3 Pro will be available in the US in January 2022, starting at $1,699.99 and $1,899.99, respectively. The ConceptD 3 Ezel will be available in November, starting at $1,899.99, while the ConceptD 3 Ezel Pro will hit the US in 2022 starting at $1,999.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook 515 is made for business on the go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook 515 open, to the right, on a clear table. The screen displays The Verge homepage." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yabobuRI4B85WjI3JFWzw4tSZZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988527/akrales_211012_4789_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Chromebook 515 is a new line from Acer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nn5aUn"&gt;Like most laptop manufacturers, Acer has been courting remote workers and students with many of its new releases. I’ve spent some time with an early sample of the Chromebook 515, a new line targeting remote business users.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNtILo"&gt;Perhaps most importantly for many work-from-home customers, the 515 looks to be a solid video-conferencing tool. The speakers, with the help of a built-in smart amplifier, deliver audio that’s surprisingly loud and easily fills a room — it’s louder than the audio of many much more expensive Windows laptops I’ve reviewed recently. The webcam has a physical shutter that’s easy to slide back and forth and did a good job keeping me visible in dim light (though it delivered a somewhat grainy picture). There are two built-in microphones as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook 515 open from the front on a clear table. The screen displays a blue and white pattern." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJcn33cgHhMy3QCi4RO_trVG3DQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923017/akrales_211012_4789_0077.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The lid of the Acer Chromebook 515 seen from above on a clear table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S3KSStIc5Y9uqBRYh6cJEAw4YEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923015/akrales_211012_4789_0037.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook 515 keyboard seen from above on a clear table. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VtTxTe1zWmnoSyhW7ZJovnUXsxs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923016/akrales_211012_4789_0021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="illp8d"&gt;The laptop also has the specs to accommodate a wide range of workloads. My unit has a respectable Core i3-1115G4 — models can also come with a Pentium Gold 7505, a Core i5, or a Core i7 (which will be overkill for most consumers). It performed speedily throughout my daily workload of around a dozen Chrome tabs and had no trouble playing YouTube videos over top. Acer hasn’t provided the battery size but claims you’ll get up to 10 hours. And while the 15.6-inch display isn’t the brightest, it’s quite roomy for multitasking and matte enough not to kick back any intrusive glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26sa8z"&gt;The main downside of the Chromebook 515 seems to be that it’s a bit ugly. I wouldn’t call it an eyesore, but it’s got the look of something you might pull off a school laptop cart — the bezels around the panel are chunky, and there’s significant flex in both the lid and the keyboard deck. It does have a nice finish, though, which is comfortable to hold, and it’s fairly portable at 3.75 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65lTnA"&gt;There are technically two Chromebook 515 models: the regular Chromebook 515 and the Chromebook 515 Enterprise. The only difference, as far as I can tell, is that the latter ships with &lt;a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/"&gt;Chrome Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, which includes extra security and management tools for IT departments. That’s also the only model that currently has a US release date — it’s coming to North America in January 2022, starting at $649.99, and to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in October with a starting price of €799. The regular model is coming to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in October and will start at €499. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook 515 keyboard seen from the side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jgewa-adoxiLGT73w08B1W24E5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922879/akrales_211012_4789_0117.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6b_7lhTeBtdjbeCiW503kO-5DFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923018/akrales_211012_4789_0050.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ATeyKOLePsqq1UZ1N-JDqXsWmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922887/akrales_211012_4789_0052.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDYc7n"&gt;If you’d prefer something a bit smaller, the new 14-inch Chromebook 514 is powered by a MediaTek Kompanio 828 processor. Acer claims that one will get up to 15 hours of battery life. You’ll be able to buy it in North America in December, starting at $399, and in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in November, starting at €399. The company’s Chromebook Spin 514 and Chromebook Spin 314 have also been updated with 11th-Gen Intel processors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Predator gaming projector is one of the first to support variable refresh rate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Predator GD711 projector" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TuT8O579hQbg6kQCT-Sm1M9ANyc=/1x0:1972x1314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988526/gd711hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just two people enjoying the delights of variable refresh rate on a projector.&lt;/em&gt; | Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gBAHhP"&gt;Acer’s Predator lineup of gaming products now includes two 4K projectors: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fpredator-gm712&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22722888%2Facer-predator-gaming-projector-gd711-gm712-variable-refresh-rate-4k-vrr-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GM712&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fpredator-gd711&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22722888%2Facer-predator-gaming-projector-gd711-gm712-variable-refresh-rate-4k-vrr-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GD711&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on the GD711 first because that’s the one Acer chose to share the most information on, it’s an LED projector that boasts up to 1,450 ANSI lumens of brightness (or 4,000 LED lumens) with HDR10 support. It supports 4K resolution in standard mode, but it stands out with its variable refresh rate (VRR) mode that’ll display a smoother image as performance fluctuates in powerful consoles, including the Xbox Series X and fast PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXSYhf"&gt;In that mode, it bumps the resolution down from 4K to 1080p resolution but boosts the refresh rate to 120Hz for consoles or up to 240Hz for PCs and notably can dynamically shift the refresh rate as needed. The PS5 supports up to 120Hz at 1080p, but it doesn’t yet work with VRR. I couldn’t find any other projectors on the market that support variable refresh rates (though several high-end TVs do), so this seems like a big feature that Acer has in its court to differentiate itself from other models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator GD711" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucxJmcLKvdcfcVstuVzfcPZEtXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922159/gd711_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A close-up of the GD711.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CFWacJ"&gt;Acer says the GD711 has a wide range of possible throw sizes, though it recommends a 100-inch screen thrown from 8.85 feet away. It’ll ship with the &lt;a href="https://en.aptoide.com/"&gt;Aptoide TV app store built-in&lt;/a&gt;. This model has two HDMI 2.0 ports, an audio-out port, and three USB-A ports. It has an expected lifespan of approximately 30,000 hours in Eco mode or up to 20,000 hours in standard mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjttLj"&gt;Acer hasn’t shared an expected release window for the US, but it’s set to land in China in November for 11,999 Chinese Yuan and in December in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for 1,499 Euros. Converting these two currencies to the US dollar puts it between $1,700 and $1,860, but keep in mind that this is an approximation on my part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A43mVT"&gt;Coming back to the GM712, it’s a lamp-based 4K gaming projector that’s far brighter than the GD711 with 3,600 ANSI lumens of brightness, and it’s a little more affordable, too. It’s coming to China in November for 10,999 Chinese Yuan, and then to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in January 2022 for 1,399 Euros. While the slightly cheaper price is nice, it’s heavier than the GD711, and it has a more limited lifespan at about 5,000 hours in standard mode, or up to 12,000 hours in its “ExtremeEco” mode. That said, it does have many of the same features of the GD711, including variable refresh rate, HDR10, and support for up to 240Hz refresh rate for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator GM712 projector" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxQvIw8kuQj7zbEaWpFQvhUuGdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922166/gm712.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the GM712 lamp-based projector. It comes with the decal, but popcorn and energy drinks sold separately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j5poJT"&gt;For those who usually shop for TVs, this might have been a rude awakening that projectors can get pricey. Considering that these pack in some gaming-focused features like fast and variable refresh rates, the high prices start to make sense. If portability is paramount for your gaming setup, then you might want to stay tuned in the coming months for pricing and availability in your region.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker announces Soundcore’s first audio glasses, priced at $200</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRcvllYVamjBpwnngrsGA3vRad4=/0x4:2040x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988455/_20_Wander_frame_with_male_model.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFY010"&gt;Anker is joining in on the trend of glasses that pull double duty as music listening devices. Today the company’s Soundcore brand announced the $199.99 Soundcore Frames. That price gets you the glasses’ temples and a frame of your choosing. The frames can be swapped out for any of the 10 different designs, but the chunky side temples always stay the same polished black style. They’re due to start shipping in mid-November and will be available from Anker’s website, Amazon, and Best Buy among other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBcCBW"&gt;The temples essentially act as true wireless earbuds, with two speakers in each one. This is a strategy we’ve seen from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314474/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-announced-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;other companies like Razer&lt;/a&gt;. In Anker’s case, it makes it simple to switch the temples to a different frame; polarized, blue-light filtering, and prescription lens options will also be available. Additional frame styles will sell for $49.99 each. The company will let people virtually try on frames through its Soundcore smartphone app for Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VW-Um2aFaVEuwZsGGvdYAWfO75A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923411/A3600012_Bluetooth_Audio_Smart_Glasses_TD02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frames easily detach from the temples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe1d2E"&gt;There are two speakers on each temple, and in most cases outside, most people won’t notice your glasses are playing music. But if you’ve got the volume up inside, there’ll definitely be some sound leakage to those nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCp9yj"&gt;Battery life is estimated at up to 5.5 hours of continuous playback, and the Soundcore Frames are IPX4 water resistant. Similar to the controls we’ve already seen from Bose and others, they use simple tap and swipe controls on the temples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg6aHF"&gt;Anker is very much aware this is its first attempt in a category that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22351451/bose-frames-tempo-audio-sunglasses-review-features"&gt;led by Bose&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;some extent Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is hoping it can do its own part in pushing the concept of audio glasses to wider popularity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On The Verge is happening October 22nd and 23rd, and you’re invited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlYPPOHcKDl29XQcexxX6AMidVA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936061/Stage_2__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of The Verge’s 10-year party at Spring Studios in NYC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Join us in New York City for live performances, amazing artists and creators, and much more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Kg9Dbv"&gt;Hello, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;friends! It’s almost been 10 years since we launched (can you believe it?), and to celebrate we’re throwing a big party. It’s happening on October 22nd and 23rd in New York City — and &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;we hope you’ll join us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVpRtM"&gt;We’re throwing this party at Spring Studios, which has a rich tradition of bringing creative people together to show off the future of tech, art, and culture. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will completely transform the space for two days and fill it with special guests, live performances, interactive art and games, awesome food and drink, and an opening night party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s6d3e5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Join us at On The Verge!","description":"The Verge is turning 10, and you’re invited to help us celebrate in New York City on October 22nd and 23rd. (Hint: get $150 off the standard ticket price with code &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$99NOW&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.)","label":"Buy tickets","url":"https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergesecondary"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="naCd5g"&gt;Here’s some of what we’re excited about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mZNe56"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;exclusive premiere screening&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFPdR85yOiM_jt1LXuZmNesYYt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892324/Springboard_Thumb.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1cOLZ"&gt;Everyone who attends On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will see the debut of our biggest documentary to date, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring split off from the mainstream tech world to try and invent the future before the present was ready for it. And though Handspring has been relegated to the margins of tech history, many of the predictions they chased in the late 90s would be correct. After the screening, we’ll hold a live Q&amp;amp;A with Dieter and Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZAiQs"&gt;Live performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="6JlhL4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbK_dQ5wXGk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4dwsn"&gt;Our opening night party will feature a live performance by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I73SGyUTsM"&gt;The Stickmen&lt;/a&gt;: an amazing DJ and drummer duo that will transform our expo space with light and sound. And we’ll have a great lineup of other talented DJs to bring the space to life throughout the entire event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8oDjmw"&gt;A one-of-a-kind indie arcade&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFrKpRby46MNr5VdJ339qsI949k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890465/ef97f32612f5c2179942fd123755ab13.WONDERVILLE.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95rs8S"&gt;We’ve assembled a wildly creative group of artists &amp;amp; creators to make On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fun and interactive. That includes the folks from &lt;a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/"&gt;Wonderville arcade in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, who will be putting together their unique lineup of games for guests to enjoy. (We’re particularly excited about The Giffinator, which will let you put yourself and your friends inside of a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;animated GIF.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k5WLcE"&gt;Experimental art&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39ulcNkSY3OtkZmgjHNc5C-7cC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890725/Studio_5.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fb72u9"&gt;We’re gathering creators working on the edge of the future, including the wildly talented &lt;a href="http://zach.li/"&gt;Zach Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;: an artist, researcher, and educator who creates performances and installations that take human gestures as input and amplify them in different ways. He’s bringing several works to On The Verge, including &lt;em&gt;Reflection Studies, &lt;/em&gt;which will transform one of the largest spaces at Spring Studios into an interactive art experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkKPLi"&gt;The Creators Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="w3DW5e"&gt;We’re turning the roof of Spring Studios into a space for interactive talks, demos, and performances — including science and tech demos, a creative illustration class, and a repair school hosted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22702324%2Fon-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our friends at iFixit&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to just hang out, you’ll be able to take in spectacular views of the city while enjoying some of the best food and drink it has to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jVbQ7D"&gt;A special live &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="irKens"&gt;Nilay and Dieter will be joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;alum Joanna Stern and David Pierce to look back at 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and talk about their favorite memories from creating the site. Then, they’ll be joined on stage by special guest Yänjaa Wintersoul: an award-winning memory athlete. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;hosts will see if their memory of covering gadgets for a decade can stand up to the skills of a World Memory Champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dc3rTb"&gt;All-day programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2e8oqK"&gt;On top of all that, our main stage will be packed for both days of the event with live performances and talks with special guests, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Id7oc1"&gt;Dieter and Nilay will sit down with Nick Weaver, co-founder and CEO of Eero, to chat about the future of the smarthome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I80rVv"&gt;Alex Heath will be joined by Snap SVP Ben Schwerin and Snap star Jacques Slade to talk about creating on the resurgent platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EvCxvA"&gt;Dan Seifert will hang out with the iFixit crew and discuss the right to repair our devices, as iFixit tears down a Nintendo Switch live on stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RZCGDg"&gt;Rapper, producer and songwriter Ricky Desktop will offer a live demo and share how he broke through TikTok into the music industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EmVxVo"&gt;... and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="916hDr"&gt;Head over to the event website &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;to learn more about who’s coming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDTzIs"&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;first big event, and it won’t be our last. We hope you’ll join us as we kick off the next 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which will be bigger, brighter, and more exciting: just like the future we imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj6nCR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: COVID-19 is still a reality, and the health and safety of everyone at the event is our first priority. So everyone who joins us will be required to follow masking protocols and provide confidential proof of vaccination. Stay tuned: we’ll keep everyone updated on the latest health and safety requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash launches $1 million disaster relief fund for restaurants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0vrGT5lnnMFvWrK13W-5CGqbgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988413/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ms7x2p"&gt;Restaurant delivery platform DoorDash has launched a restaurant disaster relief fund that will offer grants of up to $10,000 to US restaurants affected by natural disasters over the next year, the company said Wednesday. The $1 million fund will be open to eligible restaurant owners beginning November 1st and is a partnership with small business assistance platform Hello Alice. Restaurants affected by Hurricane Ida in August and the ongoing California wildfires are eligible to apply, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1Pcf1"&gt;To qualify, restaurants must be experiencing hardship due to a state or federally declared natural disaster; have a brick-and-mortar location in the US with three or fewer locations; and have fewer than 50 employees per location. The restaurants have to have revenue of $3 million or less at each location for the past 12 months and have been open for at least six months. Applications will be processed every three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFiNK9"&gt;Restaurants can use the grant funds for rent, utilities, maintenance, supplies, payroll, and other essential expenses, DoorDash said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qrsgf"&gt;The company also unveiled a new partner program that matches merchants on its platform with a dedicated point of contact for support and banking reconciliation issues, and it introduced a new mobile app for iOS and Android, which it says will be available “in the coming months.” It will allow restaurants to track live orders and get real-time data about sales and operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAwp4Y"&gt;DoorDash’s latest announcement in support of restaurants comes at a somewhat awkward time. The company is involved in two lawsuits against New York City that involve laws attempting to regulate how delivery companies work with restaurants there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTaOC3"&gt;Along with Grubhub and Uber Eats, DoorDash is suing NYC for capping the amounts the platforms can collect in fees from restaurants. In a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839571/Delivery_Platforms_Complaint.pdf"&gt;complaint filed&lt;/a&gt; in US District Court on September 9th, the companies argue that the fee caps are government overreach. They sought an injunction preventing enforcement of the rule which restricts platforms from charging restaurants more than 23 percent per order, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/delivery-providers-accused-violating-nyc-fee-cap"&gt;accused of adding unclear fees&lt;/a&gt; on top of their delivery fees, exceeding the maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dCls5"&gt;And on September 15th, DoorDash filed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675517/doordash-sues-new-york-city-law-delivery-share-customer-data-restaurants"&gt;lawsuit against New York City&lt;/a&gt; over its law requiring delivery companies to share customer data with restaurants it works with, &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/09/15/doordash-stands-up-for-new-york-city-consumer-safety-and-privacy/"&gt;calling it&lt;/a&gt; “a shocking and invasive intrusion of consumers’ privacy.” Earlier this month, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nyc-will-not-enforce-restaurant-customer-data-sharing-law-while-doordash-sues-2021-10-05"&gt;city agreed to hold off&lt;/a&gt; on enforcing the data-sharing requirement while the lawsuit is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTn0zE"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-reports-record-q2-sales-but-swings-to-a-loss-11628801842"&gt;second-quarter earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, DoorDash reported its gross order volume was up 70 percent year over year to $10.5 billion, but revenue was up 83 percent from the year-ago quarter, to $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Max are $100 off at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max from above" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11VnAW3NZ3yiwxlw_W4XsA-P93o=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988411/npatel_201209_4332_0019sq.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MaBQ8X"&gt;Another day, another sweet deal on the Apple AirPods Max. This time you can get them in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=9&amp;amp;imprToken=6cbe3b18-a2b8-9f79-016&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22486582%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?sharedid=vergedeals&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Max-Pink%2F774269130" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $450. We haven’t seen these headphones drop below this price yet, so this is a perfect time to get your hands on some if you missed out on any of our previous deals. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;Our reviewer Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt; was impressed by the “tremendous build quality and sound” but was a little put off by the price. This sale helps soften the blow of the initial sticker shock and brings them a little closer to competitors from Sony and Bose.

This 128GB card effectively triples the storage space of a Switch console (or any other compatible device) and couldn't be easier to use. Just flip open the SD card port and slot it in. Prices on SD cards tend to fluctuate a lot, so if you’re in the market for some extra storage or will be soon, now might be the time to jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oNYOb6"&gt;One of the best gaming keyboards available, the Corsair K100, is currently enjoying a sizable discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-K100-Optical-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08HR74WV4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=12&amp;amp;imprToken=82be3b19-5cdd-7cf8-d1b&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22486582%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon, making it just $190&lt;/a&gt;. This gaming keyboard pulls out all the stops in terms of features, bringing together macro keys, RGB lighting, and dedicated media playback controls. The standout feature of the K100, however, is the control knob in the upper left corner. This dial can be used to control a variety of options, including brightness control, track jogging, window zoom, or switching between focused applications. The keyboard can be equipped with either Cherry Silver switches or Corsair’s proprietary OPX optical switches, depending on your preference. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is down, as many users can’t post or send messages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0qetljI3w5--QOjcQSbaeWN3PY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988409/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUmaBr"&gt;For the last couple of hours, Snap Streaks have been at risk as many users report they can’t successfully post story updates or send messages on the service. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapchat Support Twitter account confirmed there are issues this morning, telling people to “hang tight, we’re looking into it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZXmVN"&gt;The source of the issue is unclear, but this doesn’t seem to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"&gt;Facebook-level event&lt;/a&gt; that could take a long time to fix. The app itself is still mostly functional for some of us, and if you don’t try to post you may not notice anything is wrong right away. It’s also not crashing constantly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600902/snapchat-crashing-down-outage-issue-app-login"&gt;which has been a problem for Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. So whenever service is restored, you may not need an update before you can connect again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhIUFK"&gt;Based on user reports, our own experiences, and &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/snapchat/"&gt;a peek at DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, the problem isn’t fixed yet, but if we receive any information from Snapchat or notice things changing, we will update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KE8xvF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some Snapchatters are having issues using the app right now - hang tight, we’re looking into it!&lt;/p&gt;— Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6600 official: 1080p for $329, at retail any moment now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HOih6ZFzdo5tDETOD6wqcOqeTKo=/0x0:1322x881/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988257/rx_6600.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="38UExT"&gt;Surprise! AMD just revealed the $329* Radeon RX 6600, a new budget 1080p gaming graphics card that should be available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amd+radeon+rx+6600&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3F_dyncharset%3DUTF-8%26browsedCategory%3Dabcat0507002%26id%3Dpcat17071%26iht%3Dn%26ks%3D960%26list%3Dy%26qp%3Dchipsetmanufacture_facet%253DChipset%2520Manufacturer%7EAMD%26sc%3DGlobal%26st%3Dcategoryid%2524abcat0507002%26type%3Dpage%26usc%3DAll%2520Categories&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=4294966937+4294820651"&gt;Micro Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2Fpl%3FN%3D100007709%2520601359511" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt; starting as soon as &lt;em&gt;the very moment we published this story&lt;/em&gt; at 9AM ET. Given how exorbitant GPU prices have been during the global chip crunch, you should probably stop reading if you want one and &lt;em&gt;get with the clicking&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhALx5"&gt;OK: If you’re reading these words, I’m assuming you’ve now secured either a new GPU or a dose of disappointment. Great! Now let’s discuss why you might actually want this video card, based on my recent briefing with AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KdgoQv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;*all of these prices are made up by AMD and Nvidia and you’ll rarely ever see them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jVKEDM"&gt;If you’ve read my colleague Tom Warren’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;AMD RX 6600 XT review&lt;/a&gt;, you know we already considered that $379* card an entry-level GPU. It was capable of playing most of the latest games at 1080p and maximum settings, but not all, not with ray-tracing, and was definitely a sizable step beneath the $400* Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti that costs just $20 more*. It’s exactly the kind of bang-for-the-buck GPU that I used to buy myself, though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biFJOP"&gt;Well, the new RX 6600 is the exact same GPU, but with four fewer compute units (28 instead of 32), slightly slower clockspeeds, and reduced power consumption of just 132 watts (vs. 160 watts) so you can easily fit it into a system with a 450-watt power supply,  instead of the 500 watts AMD recommends for the 6600 XT, let alone the 550-watt that even Nvidia’s entry level $329* GeForce RTX 3060 asks buyers to bring to the table. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFCgZmvQtatvsrcTzqRg2y6BQ74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922770/6600_fps.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD says its card wins some and loses some compared to the identically priced* Nvidia RTX 3060.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NkFqQK"&gt;In practice, AMD says you’re looking at a 10 to 15-percent performance gap between the 6600 and 6600 XT, but the company would rather you look at its 23-percent uplift over Nvidia’s RTX 2060 instead — assuming you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310745/amd-ryzen-3000-smart-access-memory-resizable-bar"&gt;taking advantage of Smart Access Memory aka Resizable BAR&lt;/a&gt; with a compatible CPU and game, anyhow. If so, AMD says you can expect to average 91 FPS in &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6,&lt;/em&gt; 85 FPS in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; at maximum levels of detail, and averages 100 FPS across the company’s test suite, compared to 120 FPS average for the 6600 XT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGDTEF"&gt;The company also says its Nvidia DLSS competitor, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is potent enough in games like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; that you can step up to 1440p plus raytracing and still average 60 FPS (assuming you’re pairing it with a Ryzen 5 5600X processor and DDR4 3600MHz RAM or better). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_H5JDafs2meRjsymcVkn1ouvF7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922779/rx6600_gpus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J0oliG"&gt;Unfortunately, most of AMD’s GPU board partners don’t seem to be taking full advantage of the RX 6600’s reduced power consumption yet. While ASRock does have a single-fan design and Sapphire’s dual-fan looks fairly svelte, every card takes up at least two full slots in a case and they all still require 8-pin PCIe power connector — and the PowerColor card still quotes a 500W power supply recommendation, not 450. Still, like the Nvidia RTX 3060, the reduced size and power requirements could make it popular for smaller builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OtQ3o"&gt;You should find full reviews of the AMD RX 6600 at a variety of reputable publications today, and we’ll add a few of their conclusions later in the day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;But as with any graphics card during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, actual retail availability at a reasonable price matters &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more than comparative performance, since you generally can’t find anything close to its MSRP — and that goes double for AMD, whose availability has been notably worse. Here’s AMD’s statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on supply this time around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LbgJ0F"&gt;AMD is working closely with board partners, OEMs, SIs and etail/retail partners to ensure as many graphics cards are available to gamers as possible, and we expect that a healthy supply of AMD Radeon RX 6600 graphics cards will be available at launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jZzxLS"&gt;“Healthy” is a very difficult word to pin down, but we’ll see. Late last month, AMD CEO Lisa Su suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;chip supplies would likely be “tight”&lt;/a&gt; until the second half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
