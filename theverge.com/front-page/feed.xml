    <title>Apple announces release date for watchOS 8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1k0ZQtT__1hJrZNNrbPl7-mnh8E=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857640/lcimg_e0eb6a55_c77c_4513_86a9_1373f1fd5bb0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aNYsAO"&gt;Apple is releasing the next version of its smartwatch operating system, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/watchos-8-brings-new-access-connectivity-and-mindfulness-features-to-apple-watch/"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The company first introduced the new free update at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; and has been testing it in public beta over the summer alongside iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3RVSE"&gt;WatchOS 8 is a modest change to Apple Watch but still has some nice additions. Apple is adding support for new iOS 15 features like Focus mode for more granular control over app notifications and new types of keys and ID cards in Apple Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyFBly"&gt;The new watchOS is also getting new watchfaces to take advantage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7’s larger screen&lt;/a&gt; and new workout types for pilates and tai chi (along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;other updates to Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;). The Apple Watch is also getting a spruced up Mindfulness app that combines features from the previous Breathe feature with new ways to relax. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces release date for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CSra39oejILjbC-WWVspx8PFWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857603/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O3b1aE"&gt;Apple says it’s releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-with-breakthrough-performance-in-stunning-new-design/"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced the new free operating system updates at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; earlier in June, and offered public betas over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJPbqF"&gt;Both of the new versions of iOS and iPadOS offer a grab bag of features. The headliners include changes to notifications like the addition of notification summaries, Focus modes for creating distinct lists of apps and notifications allowed to reach users at different times of the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;improvements to FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; that include the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;invite Android and Windows users&lt;/a&gt; to calls for the first time, and a new look for Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vW1lJs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A features grab bag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ILFLD"&gt;On iPad, iPadOS 15 finally brings iOS 14 features like the app library and resizable widgets, and the other previously mentioned goodies Apple has planned for iOS 15. As part of the update, Apple is also once again tweaking how multitasking works, with a new menu for split screen, and a “shelf” for organizing apps that offer separate windows, like Safari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YteJug"&gt;Some features for both iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 will take a bit longer to arrive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple says SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to share video and audio live over FaceTime calls, is slated for later this fall. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro is the first iPhone with 1TB of storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDFzpLv05LVFb8HlB3JeNO_7VF8=/116x0:1318x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857579/cCGjh1M.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gh8in0"&gt;Apple announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;new iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; handset today during the company’s California Streaming event. It’s the first iPhone to ship with 1TB of storage as an option, allowing owners to store double the maximum capacity of 512GB on the regular iPhone 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTgdWa"&gt;Apple has previously offered 1TB for iPad storage but has kept the 512GB maximum on the iPhone Pro side until today. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670072/apple-iphone-13-pro-models-1tb-storage-kuo"&gt;Rumors had suggested&lt;/a&gt; we’d get a 1TB iPhone this year, and it comes two years after Samsung shipped its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18229628/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-price-full-specs-storage"&gt;Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a 1TB storage option for $1,600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyzWvZ"&gt;Apple is also bumping iPhone storage on the standard models. The base iPhone 13 model will now ship with 128GB instead of the 64GB storage found on the iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HLo1K"&gt;Apple’s iPhone Pro 13 will start at $999 and is shipping on September 24th. The 1TB storage option will be available on the iPhone 13 Pro for $1,499 and $1,599 on the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoKTmj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13’s new camera tricks include cinematic video and macro photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Un_8IR1cPAm0pRvKn3ypZ5ygUY=/281x0:1780x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857560/camera.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JEHvhP"&gt;With a design that’s largely similar to last year’s phones, Apple is leaning on big upgrades &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; lineups to get people excited. Some of the most substantial improvements to the 2021 iPhones are found in the camera(s), and the company today announced several new features that will produce better still photographs and videos on the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXkYeb"&gt;The first is a new “cinematic mode” for video that replicates the rack focus effect commonly seen in movies. The iPhone 13 smoothly transitions between forefront and background focus based on what’s occurring in the frame. The system is intelligent enough to change focus when a subject looks away from the phone. You can also manually tap to change or lock focus on your preferred subject. Cinematic mode is also available on the iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQjwlq01LQMDbrzbYVqZse1ZoEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850277/cinematicvideo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinematic mode intelligently shifts between foreground and background focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7PfeMU"&gt;That cinematic mode is even more powerful on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, where a depth map is built into the video file, giving you the option of changing the focus point after the fact. Also on the iPhone 13 Pro, Apple is introducing a macro photography feature that can focus on subjects as close as two centimeters away from the lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSANZT"&gt;The 13 Pro is also gaining new “photographic styles” that apply different adjustments across scenes and subject types, letting you set your favorite visual effects and maintain them across your future shots. Later this year, Apple will roll out ProRes video support on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, giving video creators more leeway in post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6indKQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is getting Group Workouts and Pilates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3oqT0MfHuSsJhghI9v_7n7eRCs=/213x0:2301x1392/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857547/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_10.35.45_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIrUqk"&gt;Apple has announced a Group Workouts feature for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Fitness Plus will also be coming to 15 new countries, including Brazil, France, Mexico, and Russia, and workouts will be getting subtitles in six languages. There are new workouts, including guided meditation, Pilates, and programs to help you prepare for winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftiCN8"&gt;Group Workouts will let Fitness Plus subscribers do a workout with a friend (or a group of up to 32 people), starting it through an iMessage or FaceTime call. On your screen, you’ll be able to see both the instructor and the people with whom you’re sharing the workout. (Hopefully Apple will include an option to turn your camera off if it gets too embarrassing.) You’ll also see your metrics and rings, and you’ll be able to see how your friends are doing on the “burn bar” competition feature and when they close their rings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8482MJgCqXGJ3aHvWe9Yyh7FpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850255/lcimg_cfac3cae_b68c_43d1_bc9f_efbb09578a02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now friends and family can see how much I struggle with cardio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PegOdX"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t announced a way to let two people share a workout on the same screen, though you likely could share a workout with a roommate or family member if you each have your own device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eg1_Kw3HSjffGZUViY2BJzs1IW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850268/lcimg_5d8283a0_fdee_4540_b161_d937e74db109.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitness Plus will soon be available in these countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4zoOU"&gt;To go with the new guided meditation workout, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;upcoming Mindfulness app&lt;/a&gt; will include audio versions of the mediations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eksMqF"&gt;Group Workouts and support for new countries will be coming “later this fall,” which makes sense as Apple already announced that SharePlay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;won’t be launching with iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the features will be coming out later this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max announced with high refresh rate 120Hz displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KT2X-gvGS17lneGO-3UDXAvi8Fs=/147x0:1737x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857534/bHfOSj7.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u07Yi5"&gt;Apple has officially announced the high-end half of the iPhone 13 lineup: the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. They’ve got a faster A15 Bionic chip, three all-new cameras, and an improved display with up to a 120Hz ProMotion high refresh rate that can go as bright as 1,000 nits. The iPhone 13 Pro will start at $999, while the iPhone 13 Pro Max will start at $1099. Both will be available to order on Friday, shipping on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9Shn0"&gt;The Super Retina XDR displays on both models support variable refresh rates of between 10Hz and 120Hz, and are the same size as last year at 6.1 and 6.7 inches. They have slightly smaller notches that should allow for more space in the iOS status bar. The phones will be available in four colors: graphite, gold, silver, and a new light blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSTueU"&gt;Apple says the phones have an all-new three-camera system. The wide camera should offer better low-light photography thanks to its bigger sensor, while the ultrawide should see improvements too thanks to its wider aperture. The phones’ telephoto camera now goes up to 3x zoom, enabling 6x optical zoom across the three cameras. All three cameras now have night mode, and there’s a new macro mode for photographing subjects at just 2cm. Sensor-shift optical image stabilization is included on both models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4kFxQHWCmhuj_LP5WYeyZ2d-yI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850327/57Qm3gz6bg.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="is9DJe"&gt;On the software side, Apple has announced a new Photograph Styles feature, which look like it works a little like traditional camera filters with an added dose of computational photography. On the video side, the cinematic focus feature announced for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; will also be available on the 13 Pro and Pro Max. The iPhone 13 Pro will also be able to film in up to 4K/30fps in ProRes, a higher quality video format that gives video editors more control when tweaking footage after it’s been shot. However, the base 128GB storage option will &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005966/en/Apple-Unveils-iPhone-13-Pro-and-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-%E2%80%94-More-Pro-Than-Ever-Before"&gt;top out at 1080p/30fps&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says ProRes support will be available “in a future iOS 15 update.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFC3WJ"&gt;Internally, both devices are using Apple’s new A15 Bionic chip, which offers the familiar CPU and GPU speed increases compared to last year. Apple also says the chip should be faster for machine learning tasks. Battery life has also been improved, with the 13 Pro lasting 1.5 hours longer than the 12 Pro, and the 13 Pro Max lasting 2.5 hours longer than the 12 Pro Max on a charge. Storage options for the iPhone 13 Pro range from 128GB up to 1TB, the most storage Apple has ever offered on a phone. 5G performance has also been upgraded with support for more bands, which Apple says should provide better coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtNAGq"&gt;This is the third year Apple is splitting its flagship phone lineup into regular and “Pro” devices. Last year, however, many reviewers noted that there wasn’t much of a difference between the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the 12 Pro had an extra telephoto camera, lidar sensor, and more RAM and base storage, but its basic design, processor, 5G capabilities, and OLED display were all similar, if not identical, to the regular iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="CkNTNs"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 has officially arrived — the baseline, most mainstream model that will set the bar for Apple’s 2021 phone lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FkoaW"&gt;As with last year, the entry-level iPhone 13 will come in two versions: the 6.1-inch “regular” model and the smaller 5.4-inch iPhone 13 Mini. The screen is an OLED panel, although it’s brighter than last year’s, while the sides are still aluminum sandwiched between two slabs of glass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB9UQs"&gt;Pricing starts at $829 for the iPhone 13 and $729 for the smaller iPhone 13 Mini, although Apple is once again offering a $30 discount for phones purchased through carriers. Storage options for this year’s models have been bumped up, with Apple offering 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations for the two models. Preorders for the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini will start this Friday, September 17th, ahead of a September 24th release date.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikW79s5y-RaBDX8CAEJJHBCIuss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850282/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.41.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini come in pink, blue, black, white, and red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xtBs1l"&gt;There’s not much in the way of radical new features or changes here; instead, the iPhone 13 is closer to Apple’s old “S”-year model of iPhones. It offers some refinements and improvements to last year’s design rather than monumental new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frlcut"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, which saw a substantial redesign, the iPhone 13 has the same broad look as last year’s model, just with a slimmed-down Face ID notch that’s 20 percent smaller, meaning it’ll take up less space at the top of your phone. It’s not quite the minimal look that hole-punch displays offer on Android, but it’s a nice-looking improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A6dgF"&gt;There’s also a more powerful processor: the A15 Bionic, which Apple says is faster and more power-efficient than last year’s A14 Bionic chip. It’s still a 5nm chip and still a 6-core CPU (with two new high-performance and four new high-efficiency cores) — but Apple says it’s the “fastest CPU in a smartphone,” up to 50 percent faster than the competition. It also says that graphics are up to 30 percent faster than its competitors (although, it doesn’t specify who it’s comparing to). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIJvID"&gt;The new iPhone 13 lineup will also offer better battery life: the iPhone 13 Mini will get 1.5 hours more battery life than the iPhone 12 Mini, while the larger iPhone 13 should get up to  2.5 hours more battery life compared to the iPhone 12, thanks to bigger batteries, better performance from the A15 Bionic, and additional software improvements and optimizations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DusYFhdF-o9khj_qW4kSDgZQ2io=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850280/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.51.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oZS6Ik"&gt;The biggest change actually comes in the form of trickled-down camera technology from last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;: the base iPhone 13 has gotten the same souped-up camera that Apple debuted with its biggest smartphone in 2020, with a physically larger sensor for the wide camera that’s 47 percent bigger than last year, allowing it to capture more light in darker environments with less noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj12S7"&gt;The new wide sensor is a 12-megapixel lens with an f/1.6 aperture, while the new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera features a faster f/2.4 lens and 120-degree field of view. The iPhone 13 will also feature the sensor-shift stabilization technology that Apple introduced last year on the 12 Pro Max, which physically moves the wide sensor to reduce vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzsxD5"&gt;The new cameras will also be getting the “photographic profiles” feature that Apple introduced with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models, which allow you to customize the look of your photos even further for more consistency across shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XrhMCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max announced with high refresh rate 120Hz displays","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"},{"title":"The Apple Watch Series 7 has a brand-new look","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uuXWwk"&gt;Apple also introduced a new “cinematic mode” for video that allows for a rack focus effect to change the focus during a video, which the company showed off in an amusing &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;-style parody. When recording a video, cinematic mode will automatically transition focus while filming in real time, intelligently shifting focus when people enter the frame or glance away from the camera. You’ll be able to manually change focus or lock focus on a particular object for more precise control, too. The front-facing camera will also feature cinematic mode support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQ1gNooRRwRVRPeH7FQB8wNsDUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850302/lcimg_385816e3_76e0_4fe7_b78e_de8db4c4b292.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dy7G8r"&gt;Apple is also promising improved 5G performance compared to the iPhone 12, with more band support for better international 5G experiences. The company promises the iPhone will support 200 carriers in over 60 countries and regions by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYJvLx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 13th, 2:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple originally announced the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini would cost $799 and $699, respectively. The MSRPs are actually $829 and $729. The lower price only applies after a $30 discount from specific carriers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 has a brand-new look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3KmOcNdHS14eA3HasoLgaVr8qQ=/74x0:820x497/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857319/Capto_Capture_2021_09_14_01_24_25_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CojUH9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-reveals-apple-watch-series-7-featuring-the-largest-most-advanced-display/"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; looks a little different than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;its predecessors&lt;/a&gt;. The display now goes virtually to the edge of the case. That means while the Watch isn’t much bigger, everything on it should be more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shMhTn"&gt;The bezels around the display are slimmer at just 1.7mm, and the always-on screen mode is 70 percent brighter. Apple claims you can cram 50 percent more text onto the display than the Series 6. The new display also means new ways to interact, with a full keyboard that will support swiping. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W6J4CQGkReba4ZGf-0Jmk7rLl_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850197/lcimg_5ab83a83_d836_4e82_b8f5_f6ccdf0eee9f.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series 7 on the right isn’t that much larger, but it should feel bigger, thanks to much smaller bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6YXWO"&gt;There’s a new set of watchfaces to take advantage of the larger screen, including a more modular watchface so you can really peer at all the micro details related to your active rings, and a funky new watchface meant to highlight the minuscule bezels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv1BXr"&gt;But a bigger display doesn’t mean it’s more delicate: Apple claims it’s crack resistant and now has an IP6X rating, which means it should be able to take a dunk in the sand at the beach or handle other dusty environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMVbG7"&gt;It’s also just a little bit bigger: the Series 7 comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes. That’s 1mm more than the Series 6. The small Series 7 is now just 1mm smaller than the original largest Apple Watch announced back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6KnQz"&gt;Apart from the changes above, the Series 7 is an awful lot like the Series 6: same sensors and processors and none of the big square redesign that’s been rumored. Like the Series 6, the new Series 7 will also &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/"&gt;offer up to 18 hours of battery life&lt;/a&gt; and include a charger that charges via USB-C instead of USB-A and charges up to 33 percent faster (and Apple claims eight minutes of charging will give you up to eight hours of battery life). The aluminum variation will come in five colors total: the usual black, gold, blue, and red, plus a dark green that feels in sync with the rugged new support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWtSu4UACW7kFWvzFlbtzN6QQ84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850224/lcimg_d5b7c216_a765_44c8_94ea_3a59eb0563f3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That green looks practically black!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D1xWcN"&gt;Besides the refreshes to the premium Apple Watch, Apple’s also added some new features to watchOS 8. Outdoor cycling will now have better support and should automatically pause the workout when you stop at a light or just to catch a break. Fall support will now also appear in workouts, so if you wreck your bike or trip up badly during a brutal HIIT workout, the Watch will be able to contact emergency services. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;Fitness Plus is also getting some upgrades&lt;/a&gt;, including Pilates and the ability to do workouts with friends via Share Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbBblG"&gt;The Watch Series 3 is sticking around and starting a $199, and the Watch SE will be available for $279, while the new Series 7 will start at $399. The Series 7 should be available later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All-new iPad Mini announced with 5G, USB-C, and larger 8.3-inch display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQ-Fh3V_HHaNuR5iECA4AxONDP8=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857249/lcimg_7b04f92e_6e3b_4b04_83c7_9381b0d97513.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atJv07"&gt;Apple has announced its all-new iPad Mini. It features a new enclosure with narrower bezels and rounded corners. The big news is that it’s larger than the iPad Mini 5 with an 8.3-inch display (up from its predecessor’s 7.9-inch panel), making the device even more viable as a driver for multitasking or schoolwork. Apple says the screen can reach 500 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHmNxr"&gt;The iPad Mini is currently Apple’s smallest tablet, even with the bump in size. Apple was rumored to have been considering a Mini LED display on the new iPad, similar to that of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;largest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Those appear to have missed the mark; the new Mini sports a regular Liquid Retina display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncuFA65v4fZQrYnuxxe0gdDFiPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850183/lcimg_90987419_14bd_47ba_b425_5984e2255904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ILSQY3"&gt;The iPad Mini’s design has remained largely consistent since its 2012 debut. The new model is something of a shake-up to the traditional build, featuring slimmer bezels than the iPad Mini 5 and new color options. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uuGneI2Uk0jgQWaEf6z1WGpmsjk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850179/lcimg_29dd1c6f_2141_4080_b52a_db12ce0673ef.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RMePML"&gt;The new tablet also features a USB-C port, Touch ID (no Face ID), a new speaker system with stereo in landscape mode, and upgraded 12MP cameras on the front and back, including a shooter with True Tone flash and 4K video recording on the back and a new 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, which will support Apple’s Center Stage feature. It also supports Wi-Fi 6 and 5G (with download speeds up to 3.5 gigabits per second) as well as the second-generation Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the side of the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrFZnbsShiYFufYnN6IyTrtvz_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850192/lcimg_86345a67_53a1_4376_92b6_933c3d884fcd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are new slim covers but no mention of a keyboard cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qhemxg"&gt;The enclosure also incorporates 100 percent recycled aluminum; the solder of the main logic board includes 100 percent recycled tin, and the enclosure magnets are 100 percent rare earth elements. Apple claims you can expect 40 percent faster CPU performance and 80 percent faster GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6lIdp"&gt;The new iPad Mini is up for preorder today and will be available next week starting at $499.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new entry-level iPad with A13 Bionic chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emMeRePA-FWf8weLeznyupOdvsc=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857219/lcimg_06408afc_ebbc_4bcf_a6a4_db043132841a.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIQyWB"&gt;Apple has just announced the latest version of its most popular tablet: the standard iPad. This new model is the ninth generation of the iPad that first debuted in 2010, and it features a new processor called the A13 Bionic. Additionally, there’s a new 12-megapixel front camera that supports the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt; that debuted with the iPad Pro last year. The rest of the 9th Gen iPad will look very familiar to anyone who has seen an iPad in the past few years, complete with the same home button, bezels, single rear camera, and Lightning port we’ve seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9GfH4"&gt;Apple says the new processor is 20 percent faster than the one in the outgoing model. The 10.2-inch display is the same size and resolution as before, but it now supports the True Tone feature that automatically adjusts the screen’s color temperature to ambient lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVyTLKRSkH9TzQrHmXU7mL_wRAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850102/lcimg_f2245adc_fcad_44a9_9744_ee7dfc6b75b9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 9th Gen iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KeYlTE"&gt;The latest iPad will ship with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced earlier this year and includes enhancements to the iPad’s homescreen, app organization, and multitasking features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mx1lPy"&gt;The base-model iPad is the one most people gravitate toward, as it’s the most economical model in the lineup. This year, Apple has bumped the base storage to 64GB and kept the starting $329 price the same. The iPad is also compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil and the Apple Smart Keyboard. It will be available in silver or space gray and can be ordered starting today, September 14th, with deliveries expected for next week. &lt;/p&gt;
