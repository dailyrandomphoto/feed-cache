    <title>Five easy ways for Elon Musk to combine his companies into a superconglomerate</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GkZ8C9"&gt;Elon Musk thinks it’s a “good idea” to create a holding company above Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company — at least, that’s what the billionaire CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341801143631028225"&gt;said in response to the idea on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Such a holding company could be simply known as “X,” longtime Tesla shareholder Dave Lee suggested, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15949862/elon-musk-x-com-paypal-tesla-spacex-domain-name"&gt;a nod to Musk’s ownership of “X.com” from his PayPal days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNIIkO"&gt;Musk notoriously entertains changes, big and small, to his companies in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-jack-dorsey/"&gt;Twitter’s public square&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018 he even suggested one so large (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;largely baseless&lt;/a&gt;) — taking Tesla private using “funding secured” from Saudi Arabia — that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;he wound up in court&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p3aYNQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was only five years ago that Google surprise-announced a similar shakeup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pr8PVr"&gt;But the idea here isn’t &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; far outside the realm of possibility. It was only five years ago that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/11/9129131/alphabet-google-larry-page-sergey-brin-merger-strategy"&gt;surprise-announced a similar shakeup&lt;/a&gt;, creating the Alphabet holding company and splitting some of its bigger and bolder projects out into their own ventures alongside the search giant but still under that new umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvI5yt"&gt;If Musk is entertaining something similar after thumbing through Twitter, let’s have a think on what that would even look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vBctC8"&gt;Repeating Alphabet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kQCnGE"&gt;The most straightforward way for Musk to create X could be to roughly follow that Alphabet model. The big difference is SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company are all separate entities that exist outside of Tesla, the only publicly-traded business of the bunch. Let’s start with Tesla, since that’s where most of the action will have to take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBBc5v"&gt;Here’s the hilariously paper push-y way Alphabet deal was structured: Google created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Alphabet. It created &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; new wholly-owned subsidiary underneath Alphabet called “&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001652044/000119312515336577/d82837dex21.htm"&gt;Maple Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.” It then merged Maple and Google to create a new version of Google that was, you got it, wholly owned by Alphabet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6tFbT"&gt;Easy, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgEeSW"&gt;As for Google stockholders: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5fzL7R"&gt;Each share of each class of Google stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Alphabet Merger will automatically convert into an equivalent corresponding share of Alphabet stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Google stock being converted. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Alphabet Merger, Google’s current stockholders will become stockholders of Alphabet. The stockholders of Google will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the conversion of their shares in the Alphabet Merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfoWPS"&gt;In other words, Google basically said “sit tight while we change things up, and when we’re done you’ll now own a slice of Alphabet worth the same amount.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5zqT1"&gt;The same could be done with Tesla. Create a Tesla subsidiary called “X,” create a merger entity underneath &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, and then combine the merger entity with Tesla. Tesla shareholders transform into equivalent shareholders of X, deal done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZiWgnr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The trouble would more likely be philosophical&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ztZ2iW"&gt;Well, not so fast. X would then have to bring the other three private companies into the fold. Instead of being able to just shuffle them around, like Google did with businesses like Nest, or Calico, X would probably have to acquire SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CggVX"&gt;That shouldn’t be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; difficult since Musk is the majority owner of those companies. The trouble would more likely be philosophical. Tesla’s stock price is currently very high because a lot of people believe in the company. But how would people perceive the value of X stock if it includes these other operations?  Would X stock be subject to the fewer dramatic swings since the company’s value would be less dependent on Tesla’s performance? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/david_j_roth/status/212767135901024256?lang=en"&gt;Things of that nature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnUN6p"&gt;Combining the four companies under X could help Musk further sell his futurist vision (making humanity run on sustainable energy, settling other worlds, etc.). More boringly, it could help him consolidate the various companies’ financial or human resources departments, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-08/google-makes-so-much-money-it-never-had-to-worry-about-financial-discipline?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;which was a benefit Google sought with Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXMPg"&gt;Okay now let’s get weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XVjWcR"&gt;Musk buys Tesla&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ADYypj"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t gel about going the Alphabet route is Musk... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17664296/elon-musk-tesla-public-private-offering-stocks"&gt;kind of despises that Tesla is a public company&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what Musk wrote when he tried to take Tesla private back in 2018: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="exDB3a"&gt;As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Wqc9FU"&gt;Tesla’s in a much better place financially now, so it doesn’t have to worry so much about the second and third point there. But the overall message still tracks. Musk would rather manage his businesses with fewer prying eyes. Would he really expose SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company to the same kinds of pressures by folding them into a public holding company? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2eY5W"&gt;Probably not, so how do you solve that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRLbaS"&gt;Tesla is the only public company of the three currently, so... take it private. Yep. Let’s run the whole funding secured experiment all over again, but forget trying to sell it off to Saudi Arabia, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;Apple.&lt;/a&gt; Let’s get &lt;em&gt;weirder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vAogd3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seems like the least Ellison could do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h4ODCI"&gt;Musk is now the second-richest man in the world, currently worth around $140 billion. He probably can’t come up with all the money it would take to buy out Tesla at its current valuation north of $600 billion — especially since half his shares in Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-techs-cash-poor-billionaire-11588967043"&gt;are already pledged as collateral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the company’s board has limited him to borrowing just 25 percent of the value of any additional shares. It’s also unclear how much of his SpaceX shares are pledged as collateral. But using his ownership in all four companies as the basis for loans, one could see him taking a fair-sized bite out of that $600 billion price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLKUTj"&gt;He would need still some serious partners to join him in buying out Tesla. Perhaps billionaire and Tesla board member Larry Ellison? Seems like the least Ellison could do after Musk brought him into the fold following the funding secured debacle, and turned what was a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/15/investing/telsa-stock-larry-ellison/index.html"&gt;modest investment&lt;/a&gt; into what is now many billions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPreTm"&gt;Musk does seem to love Tesla’s most loyal shareholders, to the point that he tried to promise that they would still own part of the company during the failed go-private transaction in 2018 — an idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/20/18507476/elon-musk-420-funding-secured-sec-lawsuit"&gt;that confused experts&lt;/a&gt; — so maybe he could find a way for them to be involved, too. Whatever consortium Musk draws up could just stand in for X, acquire Tesla, and then bring the other companies into the fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IK71iC"&gt;SPAC X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iju2Mm"&gt;Musk creates one of the special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, that have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;oh-so-hot this year&lt;/a&gt; and calls it X. He kicks it off with a lot of his own money (likely from leveraged Tesla and SpaceX shares) and the stock price immediately soars once it starts trading, because a) it’s a SPAC and that’s just how things work now, apparently, b) its existence as a vehicle for brute force capitalism excites the masses, and c) it’s Elon Musk. SPAC X becomes a blank check behemoth, he uses it to buy Tesla and the other companies, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PWDDjv"&gt;Mars Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EGSreF"&gt;Unsatisfied with merely theorizing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837590/elon-musk-mars-government-direct-democracy-law-code-conference"&gt;what the laws should be on Mars&lt;/a&gt;, Musk establishes the first Mars Stock Exchange. He models it after terrestrial stock exchanges, but with tweaks to reduce some of his least-favorite aspects (like quarterly reporting rules or that pesky Securities and Exchange Commission). Nobody is quite sure if it’s legal, or “real,” but then again the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/27/14398492/outer-space-treaty-50-anniversary-exploration-guidelines"&gt;Outer Space Treaty&lt;/a&gt; didn’t exactly go long on financial regulation now, did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCLbGX"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AyntSq"&gt;Musk reveals he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166096/bitcoin-blockchain-code-currency-money-genesis-block-silk-road-mt-gox"&gt;bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; creator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16222590/satoshi-sec-officials-investors-ucoin-scheme-japanese"&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/a&gt;, sells all his coins, and buys Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Dp5OgK"&gt;As you can see, Musk has a few options if he really wants to create the kind of world-beating conglomerate that only shows up in the movies. It may be a long shot, but that’s sort of his&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;whole&lt;em&gt; thing&lt;/em&gt;. No wonder he thinks it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2DeAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFf1yO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nuro can now charge for robot deliveries in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/peRb3_lKsfIJz6eNmSbWnLJDLiM=/856x0:7336x4320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575385/Nuro_8.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Xd1PN"&gt;Nuro is now the first company in California that’s allowed to operate autonomous cars commercially (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company received a permit that allowed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;to test its robots&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, but this permit will allow the firm to actually charge people for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiN4W9"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/nuro/california-dmv-grants-nuro-first-ever-av-deployment-permit-ca424ebd2"&gt;a Medium post by Nuro’s chief legal and policy officer&lt;/a&gt;, the company is planning to “announce [its] first deployment in California with an established partner.” Who that partner is remains to be seen, but it’s likely to be a delivery service that can make use of Nuro’s completely driverless Prius vehicles, though the company plans on (literally) rolling out its own custom R2 bots later on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12gjks"&gt;The permit, &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-approves-nuro-to-use-autonomous-vehicles-for-commercial-service/"&gt;issued by the California DMV&lt;/a&gt;, only allows the company to operate its delivery service in parts of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, which would mean most of the Silicon Valley and its tech workers would be within its domain, but not San Francisco or Oakland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkLpbN"&gt;There are some additional restrictions as well — the vehicles will only be allowed on surface streets with a speed limit of 35 miles an hour (and the bots are only allowed to go 25 mph), so don’t expect to see an driverless Prius zipping along the freeway to make a delivery anytime soon. The vehicles are also only allowed to drive in “fair weather conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F205ew"&gt;The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16936548/nuro-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-google"&gt;founded by two ex-Google engineers&lt;/a&gt;, and was, ironically, the only company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044670/waymo-fully-driverless-car-permit-california-dmv"&gt;besides Google’s Waymo&lt;/a&gt; to get a California permit allowing it to test driverless cars. Now, it’s beaten the other company to the punch in getting the ability to make a business out of it in the state. It’s a different story in Arizona, though, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;Waymo is running&lt;/a&gt; a paid ride service with its driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Queen’s Gambit Funko Pops immortalize the show in plastic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXiKnlKOb_vj8T5c-494uk9yuUc=/0x37:768x549/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575353/POP_Television_The_Queens_Gambit_Beth_Harmon_with_Trophies.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Funko Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="klN1iG"&gt;In what will hopefully be the last surprise of 2020, Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; is getting its own set of &lt;a href="https://bleedingcool.com/collectibles/funko-pop-the-queens-gambit-netflix/"&gt;Pop! Vinyl figurines from Funko&lt;/a&gt;. The three figurines will feature Anya Taylor-Joy’s main character, Beth Harmon, in a variety of outfits from the show, none of which are chess-related, but all of which are stylish. Fans can purchase the Pops to own a piece of the show’s unique aesthetic, filtered through Funko’s dead-eyed one, but the real question is, why is &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; getting Funko Pops?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL6obX"&gt;If you’ll allow me to speculate wildly, maybe &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit &lt;/em&gt;is getting a Funko Pop, not because it’s a Netflix show that’s both &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-queens-gambit-netflix-review-anya-taylor-joy.html"&gt;critically well-received&lt;/a&gt; and popular &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/queens-gambit-netflix-viewing-record-1234838090/"&gt;according to Netflix’s own metrics&lt;/a&gt;, but rather because “getting Funko’ed” (coining that now) solidifies popular content that can be a little bit transient because of streaming algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tha14v"&gt;Netflix has been able to maintain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231023/netflix-tv-shows-movies-new-2020-pandemic-production-disney-universal-warner-bros-sony"&gt;an aggressive release schedule during 2020&lt;/a&gt; because of how many shows and movies it had already banked up. But can you honestly say you remember any of those early hits from February and March, like &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Love is Blind&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IdcXgd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Coming Soon - Pop! Television: The Queen’s Gambit. Celebrate one of the most popular Netflix series of 2020 by pre-ordering your favorite Grandmaster today! &lt;a href="https://t.co/r52BYBu3XG"&gt;https://t.co/r52BYBu3XG&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FunkoPop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FunkoPop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/R4a16S0h1k"&gt;pic.twitter.com/R4a16S0h1k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Funko at Peppermint Lane   (@OriginalFunko) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalFunko/status/1341450987739987979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iJGkv1"&gt;More broadly, was your media property really popular if it didn’t “get Funko’ed”? I’d argue no. And Netflix’s other Funko collaborations have immortalized similarly popular streaming mega-hits like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Funko-POP-Television-Money-Professor/dp/B07HJDSXBX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money Heist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Stranger-Things-Eleven-Figure/dp/B01M5IK8M9/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=stranger+things+funko&amp;amp;qid=1608758641&amp;amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;before they got folded into the Netflix soup, only to resurface for new seasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgNgFz"&gt;Getting Funko’ed is almost like getting a panel at Comic-Con; it signals a level of fan engagement that warrants capitalizing on, at least monetarily. A show might fade from interest (or Netflix’s many carousels), but plastic junk is forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2d2Ypb"&gt;Funko’s ability to spin up figurines fast certainly helps in that regard. Even if Netflix’s deal was set before the show was a hit, Funko’s fast-fashion approach to manufacturing allows it to get a Pop into production in under two months, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/13/20798910/funko-pop-vinyl-figurines-collectibles"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Goods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Given the October 23rd premiere date for &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt;, the Beth Harmon Pops fall well within Funko’s compact production window. (Another weird thing: these Funko Pops &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-collectibles%2Ffunko%2Fpop%2Fproducts%2Fpop-television-the-queens-gambit-beth-harmon-with-trophies%2F11113245.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;start shipping on April 20th of next year&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tpzkx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; Funko Pop! is an interesting flex of Funko’s manufacturing power, Netflix’s development skills, and the weird ways popularity surfaces in culture. No one will likely be talking about the show 40 years from now, but when I’m scavenging the wastelands of California and I find a Beth Harmon Pop in a busted-out suburb, I’ll remember, and barter for water accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45yYHa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verge readers can get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58</title>

  &lt;p id="NWohEz"&gt;If you own a PS4 or PS5 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership soon, Eneba has an incredible deal on its website right now: &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers can get two &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions for only $58&lt;/a&gt; by entering offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEPLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This is a real bargain — normally, one year of PlayStation Plus retails for $60. So if you are looking to stock up on this subscription for a couple of years or want to keep one and gift the other, take advantage of this deal — it will likely sell out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xF1WcC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UEqOVA"&gt;PlayStation Plus is a paid online subscription service that comes with a ton of perks for members, including occasional discounts during PlayStation Store sales and free games that switch up usually on a monthly cadence, among other things. A PlayStation Plus subscription is compatible with both the PS4 and the PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERjldv"&gt;If you have a PS5, you get an additional perk: access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital collection of “generation-defining” first- and third-party titles that were originally released for the PS4, such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; God of War&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.06 update is here to reduce your fear of corrupted savegames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nqJLQM4LuUmml1jW-z7JaDe3RZw=/0x0:1013x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575320/Ep9GMMjWwAUh_h6.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRW5Pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;is still fighting its way through some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;terrible (and hilarious) glitches&lt;/a&gt;, but developer CD Projekt Red is killing the nastiest bugs fairly quickly: &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37214/hotfix-1-06"&gt;today’s just-released 1.06 hotfix&lt;/a&gt; should keep your PC save files from getting irrevocably corrupted if they grow larger than 8MB in size. Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/20/22192375/cyberpunk-2077-save-file-corrupted-8-mb"&gt;that was actually an issue&lt;/a&gt; before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="361t1q"&gt;On console, the game should also have “fewer crashes” due to “improved memory management and stability,” and a character named Dum Dum (who I have not yet personally met in my first run at the game, please do not judge me, I have kids) will no longer vanish in the middle of a quest. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N61B7oNUEuK25mGcSo5lOHxbKPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22186789/Save_damaged.png"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The prompt shown for corrupted saves in &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E9VqzE"&gt;That’s the entire list of changes in this hotfix, so there’s not much reason for you to &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37214/hotfix-1-06"&gt;click through to the whole changelog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jKXsA"&gt;On December 13th, the company addressed the controversy around the game’s unfinished state by promising “two large patches” in January and February &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;to address its terrible performance on PS4 and Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; in particular, but also said it would issue updates to fix bugs and crashes as fast as it could. We got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;a 1.04 patch&lt;/a&gt; that addressed epilepsy risks on December 11th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;a 1.05 patch&lt;/a&gt; on December 18th that squashed loads of bugs, and now this 1.06 patch five days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSe6wn"&gt;Though the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;has offered refunds&lt;/a&gt; to disappointed players, it hasn’t seemed to affect the game’s overall success: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;sold over 13 million copies even counting those refunds&lt;/a&gt;, more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170655/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-developers-staff-bonuses-review-score"&gt;making up for&lt;/a&gt; its eight-year development budget and marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly asked employees to ‘strike a positive tone’ in research paper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V0U8zm3hGiepcU9UwRYQtVXZE9g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575059/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIulmC"&gt;Google has added a layer of scrutiny for research papers on sensitive topics including gender, race, and political ideology. A senior manager also instructed researchers to “strike a positive tone” in a paper this summer. The news was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research-focus-idUSKBN28X1CB"&gt;first reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QC8dai"&gt;“Advances in technology and the growing complexity of our external environment are increasingly leading to situations where seemingly inoffensive projects raise ethical, reputational, regulatory or legal issues,” the policy read. Three employees told Reuters the rule started in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSeGOx"&gt;The company has also asked employees to “refrain from casting its technology in a negative light” on multiple occasions, Reuters says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPSXt4"&gt;Employees working on a paper on recommendation AI, which is used to personalize content on platforms like YouTube, were told to “take great care to strike a positive tone,” according to Reuters. The authors then updated the paper to “remove all references to Google products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLN6LV"&gt;Another paper on using AI to understand foreign languages “softened a reference to how the Google Translate product was making mistakes,” Reuters wrote. The change came in response to a request from reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSLD8c"&gt;Google’s standard review process is meant to ensure researchers don’t inadvertently reveal trade secrets. But the “sensitive topics” review goes beyond that. Employees who want to evaluate Google’s own services for bias are asked to consult with the legal, PR, and policy teams first. Other sensitive topics reportedly include China, the oil industry, location data, religion, and Israel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djpVVC"&gt;The search giant’s publication process has been in the spotlight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;since the firing of AI ethicist Timnit Gebru in early December&lt;/a&gt;. Gebru says she was terminated over an email she sent to the Google Brain Women and Allies listserv, an internal group for Google AI research employees. In it, she spoke about Google managers pushing her to retract a paper on the dangers of large scale language processing models. Jeff Dean, Google’s head of AI, said she’d submitted it too close to the deadline. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158501/timnit-gebru-team-google-public-statement-fired"&gt;Gebru’s own team pushed back on this assertion&lt;/a&gt;, saying the policy was applied “unevenly and discriminatorily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfOZU9"&gt;Gebru reached out to Google’s PR and policy team in September regarding the paper, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/23/google-timnit-gebru-ai-ethics/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She knew the company might take issue with certain aspects of the research, since it uses large language processing models in its search engine. The deadline for making changes to the paper wasn’t until the end of January 2021, giving researchers ample time to respond to any concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWvWMQ"&gt;A week before Thanksgiving, however, Megan Kacholia, a VP at Google Research, asked Gebru to retract the paper. The following month, Gebru was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6hXsy"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8s3xJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andrew Yang is running for mayor of New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsqc-SVHizO4qTOcV-esNF165OI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574897/akrales_190411_3346_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="903D1k"&gt;Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang has filed paperwork to run for mayor of New York. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/andrew-yang-files-paperwork-to-run-for-new-york-city-mayor/2797754/"&gt;NBC 4 New York&lt;/a&gt; first reported the news, citing confirmation from the city’s Campaign Finance Board. Yang will be running to replace current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is term-limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1epQ6s"&gt;A longtime New York resident, Yang first drew attention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18408685/andrew-yang-2020-president-democrat-candidate-policies-universal-basic-income-reddit-twitter"&gt;as a candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary&lt;/a&gt;, focusing his campaign on the promise of a universal basic income. Yang was also outspoken about the threats posed by automation, and how its economic consequences were driving forward the opioid epidemic and a broader social dislocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MztTcm"&gt;While Yang’s campaign was successful in cultivating a dedicated following, he failed to attract broader support and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21134021/andrew-yang-drops-out-2020-presidential-race-democratic"&gt;withdrew from the race&lt;/a&gt; in February after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYU4gy"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reported that Yang was reaching out to city political brokers, but the mayoral run was still hypothetical. Wednesday’s filing shows that it is real, and kicks off what is likely to be a heated campaign. New York City’s Democratic primary is scheduled for June 22nd, 2021, and several early polls show Yang with a slight lead. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/531337-poll-finds-andrew-yang-favored-for-new-york-city-mayor"&gt;a poll conducted by Public Policy Polling&lt;/a&gt; showed 17 percent of respondents supporting Yang, the highest of any candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Daft Punk releases ‘complete edition’ of their stunning Tron: Legacy score</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Ow1_9aAc1v3WIbsTmMqL1yhR18=/117x0:1383x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574797/tron_legacy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PAVAoO"&gt;Fans of Daft Punk’s incredible &lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;score will receive a pretty good holiday gift this year: an extended version that’s now available on Spotify and Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nO7Viw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy The Complete Edition &lt;/em&gt;adds nine tracks that weren’t available on the original score, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/23/22197334/daft-punk-new-extended-complete-edition-tron-legacy-soundtrack"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the catch: these aren’t new songs. Some are iTunes exclusives; others are tracks that were only available on vinyl. There’s also an Amazon MP3 bonus track and — get this — a Nokia Music Store bonus track. &lt;em&gt;The Complete Edition &lt;/em&gt;simply marks the first time it’s all been collected in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1vcSi"&gt;Even though the tracks aren’t new, I’m excited about having an extended, complete version of the score available on Spotify. I love &lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;and adore the score. I play it almost every single day while I work. “The Game Has Changed,” “Derezzed,” “Disc Wars,” and “Arena” are perfect for productivity — not something Daft Punk may have planned for, but it worked out all the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIwHvD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;is a score I haven’t gotten tired of yet, even 10 years later. Having nine new tracks — even if they’re unlikely to compete with “Derezzed” or “The Game Has Changed” — is a perfect holiday treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXLdZ0"&gt;Now, if only Disney would kindly give us an update on what’s happening with &lt;em&gt;Tron 3&lt;/em&gt;, which has existed in development hell for years. The film, if it happens, will star Jared Leto and is set to be directed by Garth Davis. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that the iOS calculator has a scientific mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the iOS default calculator in landscape mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icidNCMgqFS6XgLW-P9Fe2GxOdE=/622x0:2310x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574753/IMG_0369.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xh9hfo"&gt;Today I learned that the iPhone’s built-in calculator app has a scientific mode — and all you have to do to access it is turn your phone on its side. If you’re the type of person who keeps your phone permanently in portrait lock (like me), this might come as a surprise to you, as it did to many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ehyfax"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;that glimpse of an alternate universe vibe when you turn your iPhone sideways and all of a sudden it’s a scientific calculator &lt;a href="https://t.co/PNxLVpXRAS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PNxLVpXRAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— J.R. Carpenter (@jr_carpenter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jr_carpenter/status/1341786812381941761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ItSy"&gt;This unlocks all sorts of functionality, like adding numbers to memory, parentheses, exponents, and all those trig functions from back in high school. The feature isn’t exactly new, or hidden: It &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-06-09-iphone-calculator-gets-scientific-in-2-0.html"&gt;was introduced in iOS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; back in 2008, and there’s actually even a screenshot of it on the App Store page for the calculator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the App Store page for Apple’s Calculator app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-s6TgkXysrFCKxXjWex8Zszo8e8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193835/IMG_0371.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was hiding in plain sight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O8rgx6"&gt;To be fair, most people probably never see that App Store page, as the app comes pre-installed on every phone. It’s not the first app that you’d probably look for if you wanted to install a new calculator, either — even with the hidden(ish) functionality, it’s still not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDF2M3"&gt;For starters, there’s no ticker tape feature, which lets you see all the operations you’ve just done, which is useful when you need to see if you’ve already added a value or not. It also makes some essential functions like parentheses — which I use in almost every math equation I do — hard to access.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a calculator’s ticker tape function, which shows the previous numbers and functions. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZuCALofVyHQNd6KWC4FylPkAfYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193842/IMG_0368.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is PCalc’s ticker tape function, which is invaluable to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y2aGlH"&gt;Thankfully, there are other options: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc/id284666222"&gt;PCalc offers a more robust calculating experience&lt;/a&gt;, and offers a free &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite/id300311831"&gt;PCalc Lite&lt;/a&gt; version that’s also worth a download. Or for more serious math, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-MultiView-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B000PDFQ6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there’s the TI-30XS&lt;/a&gt;, which can make some things (like fractions) so easy it almost feels like cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venture back into the underworld to curl up in front of Hades’ excellent Yule log</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ct-m2tD7UKM-6Gcb46iKJsgqh7k=/161x0:2225x1376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574622/Screen_Shot_2020_12_23_at_2.49.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qX0siO"&gt;It’s nearly the holidays, which means that in the long-standing tradition of the internet, it’s also time for novelty, themed Yule log videos. And this year brings an excellent new entry: a roaring fireplace in the House of Hades, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Supergiant Games’ &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saiXIz"&gt;The video is in crisp 4K, showing off the lovely art of the game (one of our favorites this year): the fireplace is decked out in gilded skulls and opulent marble, while creeping pomegranates add a dash of color to the proceedings. There are also the essential sounds of any good Yule log: the roar of a fireplace, with the crisp, crackling sound of the logs. (There’s a &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; spin, with murmurs and echoes from deeper within the House whispering just at the edge of hearing.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8lBy9"&gt;The Yule log pairs perfectly with &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; itself, &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/"&gt;which is on sale for the holidays for $20&lt;/a&gt; on the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RNTOsV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Hades is my game of the year ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MLcCZG"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; video joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/15/10223468/5-hours-of-darth-vaders-burning-corpse-will-replace-your-yule-log"&gt;long-standing canon&lt;/a&gt; of excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/24/14075268/original-yule-log-1966-tv-broadcast-digitally-restored"&gt;virtual fireplaces&lt;/a&gt; to curl up in front of, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q23_LCri1Kw"&gt;WarnerMedia’s Eye of Sauron Yule log&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJzibVS2YM"&gt;Darth Vader’s slowly burning corpse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-ErOKpO4E&amp;amp;has_verified=1"&gt;Nick Offerman’s relaxing Lagavulin scotch session&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own exploding gadgets of 2016 Yule log (commemorating Galaxy Note 7 and hoverboard fires that dominated headlines that year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wafq0R"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Yule log fireplace fueled by 2016's exploding gadgets|99995" data-volume-uuid="2525738c3" data-volume-id="99995" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-42" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkA2a1"&gt;The video is only 12 hours long, but you can always start it again (and again, and again, and again) until the holidays are done (or you’ve finally broken out of the underworld.)&lt;/p&gt;
