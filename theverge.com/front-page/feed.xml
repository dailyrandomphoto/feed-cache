    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FDxYpO"&gt;If you were worried about sending your kids back to school after the pandemic ends (or if you are a kid worrying about going back to school), I’m afraid &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-schools-are-buying-phone-hacking-tech-that-the-fbi-1845862393"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; is not going to help. Tom McKay and Dhruv Mehrotra have done a fantastic job reporting about how some US school districts are buying tools designed to break into phones to download texts and photos… even ones that have been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="U7Vg38"&gt;While companies like Cellebrite have partnered with federal and local police for years, that the controversial equipment is also available for school district employees to search students’ personal devices has gone relatively unnoticed—and serves as a frightening reminder of how technology originally developed for use by the military or intelligence services, ranging from blast-armored trucks designed for &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-diego-military-vehicle-20140918-story.html"&gt;use in war zones&lt;/a&gt; to invasive surveillance tools, keeps trickling down to domestic police and even the institutions where our kids go to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aNFVba"&gt;The devices are also expensive. The &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; reporters found some school districts that had spent up to $12,000 on the tech, which was designed for use in war zones and police investigations. Commenting on the devices, Cooper Quintin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation says that they “started out in the provenance of the U.S. military or federal law enforcement, and then made their way into state and local law enforcement, and also eventually make their way into the hands of criminals or petty tyrants like school administrators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSKYqr"&gt;Unlike in law enforcement, though, school districts don’t have to get a warrant to use the devices on students’ phones. The Supreme Court ruled that school officials only need to reasonably believe that a student is guilty of something and that searching the phone will probably obtain evidence of it. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-schools-are-buying-phone-hacking-tech-that-the-fbi-1845862393"&gt;The article goes into detail&lt;/a&gt; about the many legal issues involved and how students don’t necessarily have the right to say no, so you should definitely take some time to dig into it. Just have something nearby that you can use to help lower your blood pressure when you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7CkDiaBSErNGyJK-Y15kziZm3ps=/95x0:1112x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498986/Screen_Shot_2020_12_11_at_3.27.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pa5exA"&gt;Christopher Nolan recently went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;on a very public tirade&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of movies, including his, being seen on the big screen — but if anyone’s interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21330990/christopher-nolan-tenet-warner-bros-online-release-streaming-theaters"&gt;watching &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; opening prologue, they can do so now on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9n7h2"&gt;Warner Bros. has posted the film’s first six minutes on YouTube ahead of the movie’s digital release next week. Don’t worry about spoilers for the time-warping heist film, there aren’t any. (I saw &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;when it was released at a theater in suburban Canada; it was me and one other person at the other end of the theater.) The scene follows John David Washington’s Protagonist and a couple of other characters as they enter an auditorium to complete a mission. That’s really all you need to know. It’s a pretty fun, entirely Christopher Nolan segment that works on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2I7od"&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;and Nolan&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have become part of the news cycle again following Nolan’s condemning of Warner Bros. for deciding to release all 17 of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;2021 films on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; the same day they debut in theaters. As Nolan put it in a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.” Since then, other directors including &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;Denis Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/judd-apatow-hbo-max-warner-bros-1234850713/"&gt;Judd Apatow&lt;/a&gt; have voiced their own displeasure with Warner Bros. decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzr7jn"&gt;In a year where theatrical movie releases all but ceased to exist, Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;was the last big blockbuster of 2020 — and it became a guidepost for other studios. Although the movie performed well internationally, amassing more than $300 million, it performed poorly in the United States, bringing in just $52 million. With coronavirus cases surging around the world, WarnerMedia decided to bet on growing its HBO Max service in the United States by pursuing a hybrid release format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNpRsd"&gt;If you missed &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;in theaters, and this six-minute prologue convinces you to check out Nolan’s movie, it’ll be available to purchase digitally and on Blu-ray &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551390/tenet-home-release-date-dvd-blu-ray-digital-nolan"&gt;on December 15th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming mouse you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emGA8ro9D4lNLBPQkh0oh092_xQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66870539/acastro_200323_1777_gamingMouse_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever your budget or grip style is, we’ve found the best gaming mouse for you.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re on team wired or team wireless, here are the best gaming mice to get&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IQp8AK"&gt;Finding the right gaming mouse amid all of the options available can, frankly, be a struggle. There are a lot of factors to consider, like how it looks, how it feels in the hand, the button selection and arrangement, the quality of its sensor, and whether you want a mouse that’s wireless or wired. These details, minor as they seem, can have a major impact on your experience with the mouse you choose to buy. On the other hand, sometimes mice have features that get overblown and don’t actually work as well as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOD0oD"&gt;However your taste leans, you almost certainly want the best gaming mouse that your budget allows for. We’re going to make this decision easy for you. The best gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most well-rounded choice if you want comfort, a long-lasting battery, and the best selection and arrangement of buttons. This model’s design accommodates multiple grip styles, and Logitech’s companion software is unobtrusive and a breeze to use. It also has rock-solid wireless connectivity so you don’t have to deal with a wire entangling your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbAxZF"&gt;If you don’t want a wireless mouse and are looking for the best wired gaming mouse, look no further than the Razer DeathAdder V2. It’s unbeatable in the ergonomics department, with a design that feels like a natural extension of your hand. And while this model has a fairly simple layout and button selection, it’s all just within reach and responsive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBKPjC"&gt;That’s not to say that several mice released more recently haven’t tested the throne, so to speak. Our latest update ropes in a few of the latest wireless and wired models from Logitech, Razer and SteelSeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q2IIf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated December 11th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: We added information on Logitech’s G Pro X Superlight, and on the SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless as an option for those who want a lightweight wireless mouse that’s IP54 rated. Also added: the DeathAdder V2 Mini, a less expensive option for people who like the design of the larger version, but have smaller hands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="3lO4oA"&gt;The best gaming mouse in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vbrFc4"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Lightspeed is the best gaming mouse of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2Z1qTj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Logitech G502 Lightspeed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hMKX58"&gt;The best wireless gaming mouse you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GenFNF"&gt;The Logitech G502 Lightspeed is a great gaming mouse for discerning gamers who don’t want to compromise, as well as people who have no idea what they should look for in a mouse. It’s comfortable, feature-packed, and even though it’s wireless, it’s a fast and accurate performer that doesn’t feel at a disadvantage against opponents using wired mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJdIHm"&gt;At $150 (though commonly sold for around $100 these days), the best doesn’t come cheap. But if you’ve tossed around the idea of making an investment in a high-end wireless mouse, no other model that I tested for this buying guide justified its price so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRpLEb"&gt;The G502 Lightspeed has Logitech’s best features for its gaming and general-use mice rolled into one. The main buttons deliver a satisfying bounce response when you tap them, and unlike some other popular models, they click easily no matter how you grip your hand on the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vI0K2y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No other model tested for this buying guide justified its price so easily&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qIq7sZ"&gt;This mouse also features a quick-release button, a feature borrowed from other Logitech consumer-focused and gaming mice. By default, the scroll wheel staggers down a webpage with each step, which is how you expect a scroll wheel to work. Tapping the button releases the mechanism gripping the wheel, allowing it to freely sail to the bottom of a long page. It’s a small feature, but one that gives the mouse more versatility in certain situations, like being able to quickly scroll through your inventory when in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OwEJP"&gt;The G502 Lightspeed has plenty of other gaming-centric features. Logitech’s latest sensor, the Hero 25K, is capable of up to 25,600 DPI (Logitech issued an update in September 2020 that boosted the DPI from 16,000 to 25,600) and over 400 inches per second, with a 1,000Hz report rate. It supports a wide range of sensitivities so that, depending on your playstyle and desk setup, it accommodates both small and sweeping arm movements with the push of one of its macro buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRLAe6Nq6SE9DoYoV5sxbZJTxrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219645/akrales_190507_3407_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Lightspeed may not have the most inviting design, but it’s incredibly comfortable to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q3DLU"&gt;Another nice feature is the inclusion of 16 grams of additional weights you can insert into the mouse to give it more resistance. A mouse’s weight comes down to personal preference, and that could vary from game to game. This mouse is among the few modern wireless devices to give you the flexibility to change up the weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm0pRj"&gt;No matter what weight you choose, the mouse easily glides across mouse pads with its soft feet. Those feet are made out of PTFE (a premium alternative to plastic), the same material found in many of Razer’s mice that helps to reduce friction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZeru8"&gt;Logitech’s arrangement of macro buttons on the G502 Lightspeed first struck me as over-crowded. You’ll find six of them placed around the mouse. (There are technically 11 buttons total, if you count the main mouse buttons, clicking in the scroll wheel, and the ability to program what the wheel does when you wiggle it to each side.) But when I’m using the mouse, each macro feels within reach, and it’s surprisingly easy to distinguish one from the next when you’re in the heat of a tense match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyTc1P"&gt;Logitech’s software will let you configure the mouse’s LED lighting pattern, assign commands to macro buttons, and tweak the minute details of how its sensor tracks. And unlike the apps made to accompany mice from most other peripheral makers, Logitech’s G Hub software is simple to use and as unobtrusive as they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2V6RE"&gt;The fact that the G502 Lightspeed is wireless makes it that much easier to bring along with you wherever you go. But if you just can’t swing the $150 price, I suggest that you check out the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;, which is the wired version of this mouse. It has almost every feature that you’ll find in the wireless model — except, you know, wireless capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pvenni"&gt;Its feet aren’t made of PTFE, the material that makes the G502 Lightspeed smoothly glide across a mouse pad. It also has fewer onboard profiles (three versus five), and the scroll wheel has a slightly different look and feel. But if you don’t mind being wired up to your PC, it’s a great option for many of the same reasons I heartily recommend the G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBe8su"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SUnjee"&gt;Before moving on, it’s worth mentioning where Logitech’s lineup of wireless gaming mice fits in comparison. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight"&gt;G Pro X Superlight&lt;/a&gt; is a $150 option made for people who want a very lightweight mouse. It has the same Hero 25K sensor, so the tracking is just as good as the G502 Lightspeed, but it doesn’t have any extra features. In addition to being far lighter, it’s more plainly designed, with far fewer buttons. In fact, it’s pricier and has fewer buttons than the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726261308666686391" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;G Pro Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjhWDI"&gt;You’ll likely know if this is something you’d want more than our top pick, but since it’s more expensive than our top pick and less ergonomic, we still recommend the G502 Lightspeed for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1K4jR3"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best wired gaming mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPODoDBPSU6YYV9veJq7J9hKMOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832658/deathadderv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 is the best wired gaming mouse you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V9pnb3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Razer DeathAdder V2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cNRYjQ"&gt;The best wired gaming mouse you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAQPG"&gt;A great wired mouse doesn’t need countless features. It just needs to be extremely good at the fundamentals, including being comfy enough to use for hours at a time with games that require quick reflexes, having a simple assortment of buttons that take little to no time to master, and, of course, great performance. If this matches what you want in a mouse, the $70 Razer DeathAdder V2 is the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oR5KE"&gt;Of all the wired gaming mice that I tested for this buying guide, no other mouse felt like a more natural extension of my hand. That’s crucial when you’re playing a game that requires precision, and it’s good to have when you just want to feel support while you’re using your computer in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HHFi1"&gt;The DeathAdder V2’s design provides a lot of palm support, whether my fingers are flat and relaxed over the mouse or arched when I need to use faster reflexes. I use my index finger to left click and middle finger to right click; unlike most mice, this design gives me enough space on its right side to keep my ring and pinky fingers from dangling off the side and dragging on the mouse pad. That’s something I didn’t know I wanted out of a mouse until I started using this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWZiOf"&gt;Those design features keep things comfortable, but I think the part of the mouse that sold me is where my thumb rests. Many mice etch out an area for your thumb to relax and laze around. That’s fine, but I find that it necessitates more arm movement when the action ramps up. I prefer this mouse’s solution: its ergonomic design keeps my thumb wrapped around its side, naturally resting upon the edges of the customizable macro buttons. It’s good to have multiple buttons within reach, and the thumb location makes it easy for me to push the mouse around using just my wrist. It’s comfortable and has the dual purpose of keeping me limber in case I need to make sudden movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDrU52"&gt;(Note: It’s worth mentioning before digging into specs that this mouse is rather large. If you want something a little smaller, but with the same design perks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21314604/razer-deathadder-v2-mini-small-gaming-wired-mouse-price"&gt;check out the $49.99 DeathAdder V2 Mini&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the same sensor as the larger model, topping out at 8,500 DPI versus 20,000, but the complimentary grip tape that’s included is a small consolation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jio1NY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The part of the DeathAdder that sold me is where my thumb rests&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bRJvCY"&gt;What’s inside of the DeathAdder V2 mouse plays an equal role in it being my top choice. It has Razer’s Focus Plus optical sensor with 20,000 DPI and up to 650 inches of travel per second. You can switch between custom DPI settings with the buttons near the scroll wheel, and this mouse supports multiple profiles that you can toggle on the bottom of the mouse — each with its own setting that you can modify using Razer’s Synapse desktop software. This makes it easy to create up to five profiles for people you might share the mouse with, or to make distinct profiles for work and play, or an individual profile for each game you play. And once the profiles are stored, you can swap between them on other computers, whether the Razer software is installed or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEV2BR"&gt;The DeathAdder V2 has a few other design touches that make it a joy to use compared to other mice. Razer’s Speedflex braided cable essentially nixes the likelihood of it snagging on your mouse pad by using a different kind of fabric and knitting pattern than other brands. It has PTFE feet that will help it glide smoothly across your mouse pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E816hi"&gt;When it comes to longevity and durability, Razer claims the DeathAdder V2’s optical switches are rated for up to 70 million clicks. Razer also uses these features in several of its other mice, but the information further sweetens the deal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="20uVFV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="4uiCa0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. BenQ Zowie EC2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYkjQ9"&gt;The runner-up choice for best wired gaming mouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IyFgOW"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 is still my personal pick in terms of comfort, though I’m convinced that some of BenQ’s latest Zowie mice — particularly the EC2 that I spent a lot of time with — may be an equally good, if not better, option for some people. The $69.99 Zowie EC2 is my favorite of the company’s current catalog. It’s shaped similarly to the DeathAdder V2, in that it’s ergonomic and sloped to give your palm a comfortable surface to lay on while you game or browse. What’s more, there’s a generous amount of thumb space underneath the side buttons that I found to be spacious and equally accommodating to my grip style. All of Zowie’s mice are delightfully no-frills in terms of their design, but the EC2 is the most curvy mouse the company offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TghV8T"&gt;(Note: BenQ Zowie no longer sells the EC2-A featured in our photos, though the EC2 model is similar in most ways to the one we tested. Its scroll wheel is black, not semi-translucent like the EC2-A. Zowie says that the sensor is a bit different, too, but it offers the same DPI resolution and USB polling rates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XwQ0z"&gt;As a quick aside from this model, I want to praise Zowie for not trying to make a single one-size-fits-all mouse. Unlike other manufacturers, it makes a few size options for each mouse model. So if you’re thinking that you might want a slightly smaller version, the EC2 is something you can easily buy for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can adjust the Zowie EC2’s DPI sensitivity and polling rate without the need for a driver or software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0oXpaI"&gt;The no-frills philosophy extends into the feature offering, but that’s not to say it’s lacking. I think the EC2 offers exactly what most gamers need, and perhaps of equal importance, nothing they don’t. This mouse features four buttons (two main, two side) and a DPI button that can be adjusted on the mouse’s bottom side. Even the more advanced settings, like adjusting lift-off distance or USB report rate, are done by holding down a unique sequence of buttons when you plug it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eogqwq"&gt;Most companies make you install companion PC software in order to adjust settings like these, so it’s cool that you don’t need to install anything here to tweak the settings yourself. On the flip side, unless you’re a diehard gamer who’s constantly using those features, you might have a tough time committing them to memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mY7RQD"&gt;Some other things I like about the EC2 (most of Zowie’s mice share these traits in common) include the scroll wheel’s deep, grippy grooves. It makes a hearty click sound with every scroll, and advancing to the next notched step in either direction requires just the right amount of effort. Plus, its cable is 6.6 feet long, which is quite generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIoZOi"&gt;If you want a basic-looking mouse that’s just as capable as Razer’s, the Zowie EC2 is worth considering. The DeathAdder V2 feels more luxurious to use and has LEDs, if that’s your thing. I’m okay with relying on Razer’s software to adjust settings like polling rate and liftoff distance. Though, for a mouse that doesn’t require any software (or, in fact, even a driver), this is an alluring package that’s easy to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corsair’s Dark Core RGB Pro SE bundles in a bunch of features for the price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BlPonE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RSLoek"&gt;A more affordable runner-up to the best wireless gaming mouse &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="elmLGV"&gt;Corsair’s latest high-end wireless gaming mouse comes dangerously close to dethroning our top pick. The Dark Core RGB Pro SE has a comfortable, ergonomic build with a high arch that makes it easy to relax with during long gameplay sessions or to power through work. Its design is less angular and sharp-looking than the G502 Lightspeed, so you might take to it more quickly based on looks alone. Though, when I’m not paying attention to how the two mice differ in appearance, they feel equally comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCIrEM"&gt;It’s worth noting that this mouse is much more affordable than our top pick. Though it’s listed at $140 through Corsair, Best Buy regularly sells it for $90 and sometimes less. For the price, it’s impressive that it has a few features up on Logitech’s mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIzl96eIgoqx2d4Rp4WHJcHcoF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984089/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dark Core RGB Pro SE is just as comfortable to use as the best gaming mouse, Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LxusJS"&gt;It offers USB-C charging and supports Qi wireless charging if you have a wireless charger. This mouse can switch between 2.4GHz wireless mode via its included USB dongle (cleverly tucked under its removable, magnetic wing) or Bluetooth. Of course, you’ll get better results by using the dongle, but it’s great to have options. I found that the battery life, while decent, wasn’t quite as long-lasting as the G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOpEA3"&gt;Some smaller, but equally welcome features here come in the form of that removable magnetic wing I just mentioned, which snaps onto its right side to let me comfortably rest my ring and pinky fingers on. The textured, grip-friendly sections at the palm and near the thumb are also great. Like the G502 Lightspeed and many other mice in this guide, the Dark Core also has smooth PTFE feet that easily glide across a mouse pad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYHfoi"&gt;The Dark Core held up nearly just as well in-game as Logitech’s mouse above, though the omission of two features made me miss using the G502 Lightspeed. It doesn’t have a dedicated sniper button, and there were a few instances where the model that I tested had a squeaky left mouse button. I don’t think it made a noise more than once every few hundred clicks, and it was tough to replicate it when I tried. But that didn’t leave the best impression for a brand-new mouse. Also, I found that the battery life, while decent, wasn’t quite as long-lasting as the G502 Lightspeed. This isn’t a big issue if you can effortlessly rest it on a wireless charger to top up, but it’s a shortcoming nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKufKm"&gt;Outside of the price differences, these two play a game of teeter-totter with features. Depending on who you ask, the Dark Core might have one or two up on the G502 Lightspeed. But Logitech’s mouse edges it out with better build quality, extra buttons (not to mention the excellent scroll wheel), and optional weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="yTiNOb"&gt;The more affordable, wired take on the best gaming mouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TeVjwP"&gt;If $150 is too much for you to spend on Logitech’s wireless G502 Lightspeed, you might want to consider this wired version, the G502 Hero. It has the same design as our pick for the best gaming mouse — actually, it’s basically the same in almost every way, down to the kind of sensor it uses and its adjustable weights. That makes it almost as good, though some might take issue with its thick braided cable and the somewhat slippery plastic used on the scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm9W6Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Basilisk V2 has more features than the DeathAdder V2, though its design and feel might be hit or miss for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zeCflX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Razer Basilisk V2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="65Obx6"&gt;A good alternative if the DeathAdder V2 is too basic or big for you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs4a0r"&gt;The Basilisk V2 is the wired mouse that I’d recommend to people who want the advantages of a modern Razer wired mouse, like the thin, braided SpeedFlex cable, fast performance, PTFE feet that let the mouse glide across your mouse pad, and, of course, LEDs. Despite having a design that might not fit well in everyone’s hands, it’s a smaller mouse that has more features than the DeathAdder V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I15iEA"&gt;For instance, the Basilisk V2 has a removable sniper button that’s easy to reach. Perhaps my favorite feature here is the scroll wheel that has an adjustable tension. It’s not quite as cool as the Logitech G502’s free-spinning wheel, but you’ll probably love it if you want a custom feel to your wheel. One of the best things about this mouse is that it has most of the same features found in the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20947669/razer-wireless-basilisk-gaming-pc-mouse-ultimate-x-hyperspeed-battery-life-price"&gt;Basilisk Ultimate, Razer’s wireless version of this mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u0wODl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. BenQ Zowie FK2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1ESwc9"&gt;A great true ambidextrous mouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hfNyqt"&gt;While all of the mice above were built exclusively for right-handed gamers, BenQ’s Zowie FK2 is an excellent option that’s built for both right- and left-handed players. There are plenty of other true ambidextrous mice out there (meaning that there are thumb buttons accessible on both sides), but the Zowie FK2 is a low-profile, high-performance option that doesn’t cost too much. Like the EC2-A mentioned above, the FK2 works without the need for an installed driver. What’s more, it’s available in multiple sizes, and you can adjust DPI and a few other settings right on the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig8K1v"&gt;This isn’t the most comfortable option out there, perhaps because it was built to suit two separate audiences, though it’s tough to beat if you just want a simple, versatile gaming mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lUzWqU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T2HZ5k"&gt;A feature-packed, lightweight wireless mouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MfOTnc"&gt;SteelSeries recently released the Aerox 3 lineup of gaming mice, and chief among them so far is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21538891/steelseries-aerox-3-gaming-mouse-wireless-lightweight-honeycomb-water-resistant-usb-c"&gt;Aerox 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a riff on the Rival 3 design that’s now poked full of holes to drop down its weight to just 66 grams, though it’s different enough to justify its $100 price point for some. What I like most about this model is that it charges via USB-C (still a rarity among other popular models from Razer and Logitech) and it can operate on 2.4GHz wireless with its included USB-C dongle or Bluetooth. The fact that it has an IP54 rating to protect it from water and dust is another perk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrxRRw"&gt;This mouse has a false ambidextrous design, so while it will fit comfortably for either left- or right-handed gamers, the thumb buttons are only there to accommodate right-handed use. The reason why the Aerox 3 Wireless is on the bottom of this list, despite some great features, is because it’s perhaps the least ergonomic option. This won’t be as much of an issue for people who use it simply to game, but it’s not particularly comfortable to use as an all-day device. Also, I noticed that it loses connection with my PC regularly, but rather than a connectivity issue, it seems like it falls asleep to preserve power if you don’t use it for a few minutes. Again, not a huge issue, but it’s an annoyance to wait a few seconds while it wakes up before I can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSPhu3"&gt;If you want to avoid this issue, the wired Aerox 3 with the same design and waterproof feature &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Faerox-3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21252193%2Fbest-gaming-mouse#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TR1BuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TsB5ht"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iPhone has an aggravating text notifications bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxqCkC8QD0tyrV9CGDhB2Hs0MDE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498188/akrales_201018_4238_0435.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqOH0y"&gt;If you’ve noticed that you’re receiving SMS texts and iMessages from people but aren’t getting any notifications about them, you’re not alone. Far from it. I’m one of many people experiencing an annoying bug where messages come through fine — but without any pop-up notification or even the usual red badge to indicate that there’s a new message waiting to be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsOeVu"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/iphone-12-missing-sms-text-messages/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; wrote about increasing reports of the problem&lt;/a&gt; on the new iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max phones. But it seems to also be affecting people with older iPhones as well, so this is looking more and more like an iOS 14 issue. What’s more aggravating about the glitch is that it doesn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; happen. I’ve noticed some messages pop up on my lock screen like normal, but others just quietly roll in with me being none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfDAlB"&gt;People in that very large &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; thread have tried to come up with workarounds like turning off Messages on a Mac, or deleting and re-adding contacts. Some are noticing they get notifications if they completely force close the Messages app every time after sending a text. And in other cases, the missing notifications are only happening for pinned conversations, and unpinning contacts seems to do the trick. There are sporadic reports of success with these short-term fixes, but they aren’t working for everyone. There’s also &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251815788"&gt;this 42-page thread on the company’s support forums&lt;/a&gt; about the ongoing frustrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o91b1E"&gt;Those dealing with the issue are understandably disappointed that Apple hasn’t released a thorough fix yet. This is pretty fundamental stuff, and it’s probably causing some awkward conversations between couples or friends when messages just sit there for hours without the recipient knowing they came. And if you’re hoping that all will be well when iOS 14.3 releases next week, I wouldn’t be so sure. Early reports indicate that the no-text-notifications bug remains present — at least in some cases — in the second release candidate build of iOS 14.3 that Apple pushed out to public beta testers yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A4RJ9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Apple for more information on the status of this bug and the company’s plans to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Apple are banning technology for sharing users’ location data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5KvBPc2-u8EerPigOQpDLLmZy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498063/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWMuy4"&gt;You may have never heard of the company X-Mode Social, but its code may be in some of the apps on your phone, tracking and selling your location data. Now, Google and Apple are trying to put a stop to it. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-google-to-stop-x-mode-from-collecting-location-data-from-users-phones-11607549061"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, the tech companies have told developers to remove X-Mode’s code from their apps, or risk getting them pulled from their respective app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7JPFi"&gt;X-Mode works by giving developers code to put into their apps, known as an SDK, which tracks users’ location and then sends that data to X-Mode, which sells it. In return, X-Mode pays the developer a certain amount based on how many users the app has. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj454d/private-intelligence-location-data-xmode-hyas"&gt;According to the company&lt;/a&gt;, its technology is in over 400 apps, including many apps designed for Muslim users, such as one that reminds users when to pray, and a Muslim-focused dating app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snhtj4"&gt;Apple is giving developers two weeks to remove the SDK, and Google is giving devs one week, with the ability to apply for an extension to 30 days. But the model of tracking users’ locations and selling the data is nothing new: what may have gotten X-Mode banned was that, according to a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x"&gt;it was also selling it to the US military&lt;/a&gt;. When you consider the fact that many of the largest apps using the X-Mode were designed for Muslim populations, it’s understandable why this would be concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6t6IR"&gt;Of course, government services buying citizens’ location data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371886/secret-service-usss-locate-x-babel-street-foia-contract-report"&gt;is nothing new&lt;/a&gt;, but most of the time they buy it from data brokers, who just aggregate the information from various sources, not from companies collecting it directly. For its part, X-Mode claims it’s being singled out, saying that it “collects similar mobile app data as most advertising SDKs”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq5GkD"&gt;To wrap this up with a PSA: X-Mode, and other companies like it, can only get your location data when given permission. Often apps don’t make it clear that your location data is going to X-Mode (it’s either buried in a EULA, or not there at all), but every app on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21005009/iphone-location-tracking-how-to-on-off-apps-apple-find-my-friends"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372603/google-android-location-sharing-maps-how-to-enable-disable"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; will have to ask for permission to be able to see your location. If your level app (as in, the tool you use to make sure a picture isn’t crooked) is asking for permission for your location, it’s probably worth thinking about whether or not it actually needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jncKIU"&gt;Of course, that won’t protect you in cases where the app has an actual reason to use your location (such as with a dating app), which is why it’s good that both Apple and Google, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917988/ron-wyden-facebook-privacy-data-regulation-do-not-track"&gt;some lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;, are starting to take a harder look at how companies sell user data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qRJqhM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Americans are sick and tired of their data being misused and abused by anyone with a checkbook. Apple and Google deserve credit for doing the right thing here, but there’s still more work to be done to protect Americans’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AirdebtLFx"&gt;https://t.co/AirdebtLFx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1337088182068760576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>United makes plans to capture its planet-heating pollution   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6wdSOVH1KoLNCTjbK6EAeFwTf4=/552x0:4248x2464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68498002/1228826491.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WnTPJW"&gt;This week, United Airlines pledged to completely eliminate its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To make good on that promise, the company says it will invest in emerging technologies that capture planet-heating carbon dioxide from the air. It also plans to continue powering its flights with sustainable aviation fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Mfplu"&gt;United is the latest airline to respond to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20872267/flight-shame-nyc-united-nations-climate-change-environmental-costs"&gt;consumers’ growing concerns&lt;/a&gt; about climate change and make ambitious commitments to reduce its effects on the environment. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137782/delta-carbon-neutral-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-airlines"&gt;Delta announced in February&lt;/a&gt; that it would spend $1 billion over 10 years to become carbon neutral by reducing and canceling out emissions with carbon offsets and carbon removal schemes. JetBlue joined a Climate Pledge initiative &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-climatechange/uber-jetblue-join-amazon-backed-climate-pledge-idUSKBN28C24H"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that commits it to becoming carbon neutral by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Biy2Fj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new steps United is taking could raise the bar for airlines’ climate goals&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LPxGzm"&gt;The new steps United is taking could raise the bar for airlines’ climate goals. Unlike its competitors, United signaled that it won’t rely on carbon offsets and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;trees&lt;/a&gt; to cancel out emissions. Purchasing offsets have become a standard way for airlines and other businesses to write off their carbon emissions, by investing in renewable energy or conservation projects aimed at bolstering forests’ ability to naturally store carbon. But there’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;offsets haven’t succeeded&lt;/a&gt; in slowing global warming, and have instead given companies a license to keep polluting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toysOL"&gt;United is following the lead of tech companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068799/microsoft-carbon-capture-climate-change"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537247/stripe-customers-carbon-capture-projects-climate-change"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; that have pumped funding into up-and-coming carbon capture technologies. “These game-changing technologies will significantly reduce our emissions, and measurably reduce the speed of climate change — because buying carbon offsets alone is just not enough,” Scott Kirby, United CEO, said in a &lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/united-pledges-100-green-2050-2649438060.html"&gt;December 10th announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iI8JiW"&gt;United says it will make a “multimillion-dollar investment” that will help an initiative called 1PointFive build the first industrial-size plant in the US that can capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide it captures will be stored underground, according to United. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="O4A0fI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One big catch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWivRR"&gt;But there’s one big catch. The initiative is co-led by Occidental Petroleum, which has in the past said that carbon dioxide captured by plants would be &lt;a href="https://carbonengineering.com/news-updates/worlds-largest-direct-air-capture-and-sequestration-plant/"&gt;used for enhanced oil recovery&lt;/a&gt; — a process that uses the carbon dioxide to get to hard-to-reach oil. Even though the captured carbon is pushed underground, it’s ultimately contributing to the extraction of more fossil fuels. That’s one of the reasons these kinds of technologies have sparked criticism from more progressive environmentalists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828794/bernie-sanders-green-new-deal-2020-elections-climate-change"&gt;like Sen. Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7YtWV"&gt;Airlines, unlike tech companies that have climbed aboard the carbon capture bandwagon, are a little more limited in what they can do to stop contributing to the climate crisis. The most obvious way to limit greenhouse gas emissions is to cut down on flights, which United hasn’t committed to do. Or they could incentivize the development of hybrid planes and electrically-propelled aircraft. Battery technology isn’t advanced enough to allow commercial planes to run on renewables like solar and wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEIIP1"&gt;In the meantime, there’s sustainable biojet fuel, which United started regularly adding to its fuel mix in 2016, as a good option. If direct air capture plants — which are still in their infancy — can scale up and work out some of their kinks, it gives airlines another way to shrink their carbon footprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWdT3W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtlCzm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney finally revealed the real Disney Plus </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hs98hWoShBO8bdbRXQbwlm9e9RI=/367x0:1534x778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68497863/disney_plus.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="laA9uU"&gt;By the end of Disney’s four-hour event, which felt like an amalgamation of a San Diego Comic-Con Hall H panel and an Apple keynote, executives made one thing clear: we can do this because we’re Disney, and we’re Disney because we can do this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxMO3n"&gt;A reminder of what transpired on Thursday night: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;neverending stream&lt;/a&gt; of new Disney, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, Pixar, National Geographic, Hulu, FX, and more titles were announced in rapid-fire succession. Of those, 80 percent were streaming-only titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xg8cMr"&gt;That doesn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165950/disney-star-streaming-service-hotstar-international-movies-tv"&gt;account for Star&lt;/a&gt;, a new “streaming service” of sorts that will integrate into Disney Plus for international subscribers and essentially act as a version of Hulu. (This will also help Disney with its “lack of things for adults to watch” problem, so don’t be surprised to see something similar integrate into Disney Plus for US subscribers at some point.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGMEIM"&gt;While all of Disney’s streaming properties are important, totaling more than 137 million collective subscribers, Disney used its event last night to &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;unveil the version of its crown jewel, Disney Plus, that executives have touted for a very, very long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HyDSN"&gt;When Disney Plus launched in 2019, the idea was a relatively simple one that would accomplish three tasks: people would sign up for the service (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168484/disney-streaming-bundle-ad-free-hulu-disney-plus-espn-price-release-date"&gt;the Disney bundle&lt;/a&gt; in the United States that combines Hulu and ESPN Plus), people would stay subscribed, and every new show would help Disney’s other, non-streaming divisions. Think of all the people with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152431/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-6-star-wars-dark-forces-trooper-baby-yoda-grogu"&gt;Grogu&lt;/a&gt; (forever Baby Yoda in my heart) plushies or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22169673/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-7-believer-star-wars-empire-good-evil"&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt; action figures; think of all the &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;-related food items or exclusives that Disney will use to fill its parks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sm2sFw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An undeniable version of Disney Plus that delivers on nearly $100 billion worth of acquisitions over the last 15 years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJocfT"&gt;Launching just five months before a pandemic made the first two hard and the third nearly impossible. Disney Plus was starved of exciting new content between December 2019 and October 2020, when the first &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;season ended and the second season began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlSnae"&gt;There were a handful of exceptions — a new season of &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;’s debut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355563/mulan-disney-plus-streaming-exclusive-cost-own-movies-theaters"&gt;on Premier Access&lt;/a&gt; — but for the most part, Disney Plus was the place to rewatch the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the ninth time. Disney Plus couldn’t compete with Netflix’s onslaught of new shows and movies, new streamers were popping up every other month (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324215/peacock-nbc-universal-comcast-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;), and things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; stole people’s attention. There was a promise of what Disney Plus &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be that Disney Plus didn’t seem to realize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdXa0S"&gt;Last night’s presentation established the undeniable version of Disney Plus that delivers on nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/bob-iger-forever-changed-disney-with-4-key-acquisitions.html"&gt;$100 billion worth of acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; over the last 15 years. Dozens of new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, and Pixar projects, all based around multi-billion dollar franchises that are adored by kids and adults around the world, all appearing on Disney Plus one right after the other. Movies that would have gone to theaters are now Disney Plus exclusives, and Disney’s various TV divisions will supply a stream of shows. In 2019, Disney introduced an idea of a streamer. Now, Disney Plus will consistently be fed with content audiences have proven they will gobble up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPnC1w"&gt;A brute show of power, introduced by a longtime Disney executive who smirked when announcing, “This is only the beginning.” In many ways, the stream of announcements feels like that. Disney has spent the last year pulling the sled up the hill, trying to get to the highest peak, before jumping on and actually enjoying the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV9xGQ"&gt;There will come a time when Disney has a new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; or Marvel show seemingly every week, and that powerful harnessing of lucrative, sought-after, fan-adored brands should be terrifying to competitors (who have their own advantages. Netflix isn’t going to suddenly crumble.). Plus, even with the new shows — and raising the streaming content budget alone to $9 billion by 2024 — Disney is going to do it all for just $8 a month. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165869/disney-price-hike-united-states-bundle"&gt;a $1 increase&lt;/a&gt; for a seemingly neverending supply of Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyaXM4"&gt;What Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos once &lt;a href="https://observer.com/2019/11/netflix-vs-disney-ted-sarandos-marvel-star-wars-pixar/"&gt;referred to as a potential trap&lt;/a&gt; is Disney’s $100 billion gamble. The big franchises, the massive IP, the ability to create stories based around lesser-known characters because people are invested in the much larger worlds, all coming together to get potentially hundreds of millions of people to spend money every single month for a very, very long time. It’s exhausting to think about. It’s also going to work well for the Walt Disney Corporation. If it was easy, everyone would do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="036j83"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos once referred to as a potential trap is Disney’s $100 billion gamble&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gR3rLc"&gt;That doesn’t mean there aren’t issues. Disney’s streaming division won’t be profitable until fiscal 2024, and the company is bleeding in other areas (especially parks, where Disney has laid off &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/disney-theme-park-workers-layoffs.html"&gt;around 30,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; this year). There is increased competition, and giant conglomerates like WarnerMedia are moving fast and breaking things to try and attract subscribers, keeping their wallets and attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9d77o"&gt;Industry insiders are still scratching their heads over whatever Disney’s Hulu plan is — my opinion is that Disney isn’t going to make major investments into Hulu until it pays out Comcast for the company’s remaining stake. Why make that payout larger than it has to be when heavier investment can come after the payout and Disney reaps the full benefit? That is, if Disney is interested in prioritizing Hulu, which is still up for debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvhLnC"&gt;Those issues are important to note, but the meaningful opportunity Disney has with Disney Plus is glaringly obvious after last night’s event. One that really, and truly, officially, introduced the world to Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8rt8fj"&gt;
&lt;aside id="SNr3Nq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus","description":"$6.99 per month or $69.99 if you pay annually","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aHt5Uv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bought a startup that lets you virtually hang out with your friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6uVX0OISk-RTMelnpT8DrqtjLw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68497545/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iHUGr"&gt;Twitter has acquired Squad, an app that lets you hang out with your friends via video chat and screen-sharing, the company announced on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo4od4"&gt;Squad will help Twitter “bring new ways for people to interact, express themselves, and join in the public conversation,” Twitter’s VP of product, Ilya Brown, said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ilyabr0wn/status/1337396880800509952"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The Squad team brings “a deep understanding of how people participate in interactive audio and video conversations” and will “accelerate our work to bring people new and creative tools to start and join conversations on the service,” Brown added in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ilyabr0wn/status/1337396881647779842"&gt;follow-up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ilyabr0wn/status/1337396882440482827"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k01Wd8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’ll join our product, design, and eng teams and help accelerate our work to bring people new and creative tools to start and join conversations on the service. Welcome to our squad, team!&lt;/p&gt;— Ilya Brown (@ilyabr0wn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ilyabr0wn/status/1337396882440482827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="weF87M"&gt;Here’s a gallery of what the app looked like, taken from &lt;a href="https://squadapp.io/"&gt;Squad’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jm1B9l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10221923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTEkbB"&gt;Twitter has been exploring ways for people to connect beyond the standard tweet, as evidenced by the recent global launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;its ephemeral Fleets&lt;/a&gt; and the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570150/twitter-spaces-clubhouse-voice-rooms-testing"&gt;Clubhouse-like chat rooms coming to the service&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not hard to imagine Twitter potentially building virtual hangout spaces, like Squad offered, into the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLjH2D"&gt;Twitter’s acquisition of Squad also follows app sleuth &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1337344129995395073"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong’s discovery&lt;/a&gt; that the company may shut down its live-streaming service, Periscope. Perhaps Twitter is planning to move away from letting people broadcast video on a large scale to instead have them broadcast to smaller communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqVMgP"&gt;The Squad app will be shut down on Saturday, December 12th, according to a message on Squad’s website. People who currently use it have already been notified, a Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfZxj5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LZ3Qby"&gt;To sum it up: We’ve got another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;new Apple product&lt;/a&gt; to talk about, an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/about/leadership/cristiano-amon"&gt;president of Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, and a discussion on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;the antitrust lawsuits against Facebook&lt;/a&gt; put forward by the Federal Trade Commission and 48 state attorneys general. (I hope you understand now why we separated these into different episodes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IvImhd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NtMWS"&gt;In the first half of the first episode this week of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Chris Welch discuss the announcement of Apple’s new noise-canceling headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. Nilay was able to try them out for a brief period of time and gives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166888/apple-airpods-max-design-comfort-price-features"&gt;his first impressions&lt;/a&gt; on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow005o"&gt;In the second half, Nilay and Dieter chat with Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon about Qualcomm’s new flagship processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;, the potential of 5G, and what he thinks about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZerHD"&gt;Here’s a little snippet from that conversation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fWe7sv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Bohn: What lessons could Qualcomm and Microsoft take from what Apple did with the M1? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBRqL8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cristiano Amon: &lt;/strong&gt; One of the great things about the M1, the way we look at it, we’re super happy with that announcement. Very happy.  And kudos to Apple because it validates our belief. It basically validates our beliefs that, you know, that the mobile user is defining what they expect out of the PC experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn7pZI"&gt;And when adding Apple to that conversation, you started to see that the ecosystem is moving. Great example: I believe it was probably this week, if not the week before that Adobe announced a bunch of applications, that are all ARM native. And once you make it ARM native, performance increases as you have now app compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YgOT1"&gt;So that overall is a very good sign. The ecosystem is going to move and it showed that Microsoft and Qualcomm were in the right trajectory. It’s about battery life, it’s about connected, it’s about a whole different multimedia experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wjRqEU"&gt;Even though an interview with the president of a dominant chip maker company was enough to call it a day, we also decided to put out a separate episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;to explain some rather important tech policy news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Czix8t"&gt;In our second episode, Nilay talks with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;policy editor Russell Brandom, senior reporter Adi Robertson, and contributing editor Casey Newton about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;why the FTC and 48 state attorneys general are suing Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, what antitrust &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166978/facebook-ftc-antitrust-instagram-whatsapp-tiktok"&gt;remedies they are proposing&lt;/a&gt;, and how possible it is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165534/instagram-facebook-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-monopoly-case-opportunity"&gt;separate Instagram from Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mandalorian takes a stand on the line between good and evil in its latest episode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s94WegQEER94-45OPI1378dDKjc=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68497169/HUC2_FF_003556.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d6viZr"&gt;“Empire. New Republic. It’s all the same to these people,” comments Migs Mayfield (Bill Burr) in the latest episode of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1Ovej"&gt;For a while, it seems that the show believes it, dressing Mando up in stormtrooper armor as he goes to desperate lengths to save Baby Yoda (neé Grogu) from Moff Gideon. In “The Believer,” it’s not an X-Wing swooping in triumphantly to save our heroes; it’s Imperial TIE Fighters — a symbol that fans have come to associate with the forces of evil in the galaxy, potent symbology that &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s first season finale relied on to great effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Su06Jh"&gt;And director Rick Fukuyama works to really sell the audience on the victory of the Empire: soaring music plays in the background, as the base’s garrison rushes out to protect the battered truck, the only one to make it through the natives’ blockade. Our hero stands as the lone survivor, triumphant in his stormtrooper armor.  We see troopers and officers cheering, all but high-fiving each other at the success. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/469rL2l2RBIfWkU4VK02CPsuJZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22162695/HUC2_FF_003672.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XtBb4N"&gt;The scene is almost an inversion of one earlier in season 2, when Mando faces off against two New Republic officers, whose X-wings shift menacingly into attack mode in a scene that paints the heroic &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; ships in an almost chilling light. Deep down, Mayfield argues, “We’re all the same.” Hero? Villain? It’s just a matter of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="npCV4a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s what those in power do with that position that matters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j0SFuZ"&gt;It’s an argument that &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; has explored before. Werner Herzog’s Client back in season 1 makes a similar case: “The Empire improves every system it touches,” Herzog’s character ponders. “Judge by any metric: safety, prosperity, trade opportunity, peace. Compare Imperial rule to what is happening now. Look outside. Is the world more peaceful since the revolution? I see nothing but death and chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLcQHq"&gt;And yet, despite the reversed framing, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; rejects Mayfield’s hypothesis that everyone is the same underneath the different flags and uniforms. “Somewhere, someone in this galaxy is ruling, and others are being ruled,” Mayfield muses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtfNrr"&gt;But it’s what those in power do with that position that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UliOgP"&gt;And at the end of the earlier episode, the New Republic officers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; swoop back and save Mando and his ship from hordes of ravenous ice spiders. But the Empire? The Empire plans to use its newly acquired rhydonium to create weapons that would make the planetary destruction of &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Operation:_Cinder"&gt;Operation: Cinder&lt;/a&gt; (the Emperor’s final order, designed to bring down the galaxy should he perish) look small. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2E1HSHvqq6A7TOBzSpNzFQWZpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22162696/HUC2_FF_003662.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PL5v3K"&gt;It’s a moment that reframes the “heroic” victory before. Mando and Mayfield aren’t bringing desperately needed supplies to a village under siege; they’re transporting raw materials to make explosives. The “pirates” attacking their transport are natives, trying to defend their home against the ravages of the Empire. And the soaring fighters and battalion of stormtroopers gun them all down so that they can perpetuate the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtuxTS"&gt;It’s fitting that it’s Mayfield himself who answers the question: when faced with his former superior officer, who commanded the murder of thousands of his own troops as part of the Emperor’s destructive contingency plan following his death, the former Imperial sharpshooter isn’t able to just sit there and toast with the man who ordered it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRR6Nj"&gt;Because the Empire and the New Republic aren’t the same — even if the former has its virtues, and the latter, its flaws. It’s a sort of clarity we’ll likely get more of next week: a hero going to save his imprisoned, adopted child from an armor-clad villain with a sword doesn’t leave much room for gray areas anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
