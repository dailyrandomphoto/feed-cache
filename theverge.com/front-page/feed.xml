    <title>Watch the first trailer for Netflix’s Masters of the Universe: Revelation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yxcxsx"&gt;Our first look at Kevin Smith’s revival of He-Man is here: today, Netflix debuted the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/em&gt;, which will hit the streaming service on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78wlPi"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&lt;/em&gt;, which also streamed on Netflix, the new He-Man series isn’t a reboot of the classic cartoon. Instead, it’s a continuation, which picks up right after the original show ended in 1985, with the excellent addition of Mark Hamill as Skeletor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dmoyxL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the trailer for Masters of the Universe: Revelation has everything: swords, skeletons, '80s synth, steampunk horses, every color visible to the human eye, and, of course, Mark Hamill. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/cFsLvogp4v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cFsLvogp4v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1403020579389644801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oVmMrT"&gt;Here’s how Smith, who is serving as showrunner, describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rGBP7A"&gt;Narratively our show is set up as the next episode in the legacy ‘80s animated series that aired from 1983-1985. This is a continuation of that story. We’re playing with the original mythology and characters, and revisiting and digging deeper into some of the unresolved storylines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te5HDz"&gt;Visually we also made the conscious decision to lean into the &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; line of toys for inspiration as well. Mattel owns this entire vast library of that artwork, so right away we wanted the show to open with classic pieces of that artwork. Mattel has been committed to this look since they first started as a toy line in the ‘80s, and now we’re leaning into it and honoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UdhDjZ"&gt;The news was announced as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;the first week-long Netflix Geeked event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the debut of Tesla Model S Plaid, the ‘quickest production car ever made’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2_KM0ClvWDR4bb5AHy3cVWYwww=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434160/0x0_ModelS_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5X8n8t"&gt;Tesla will hold a delivery event for its new, high-performance “Plaid” version of the Model S on Thursday. It’s an effort by Elon Musk’s company to reignite interest in its nearly decade-old electric sedan, which is also facing stiff competition from Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. When its released, Musk claims the Plaid Model S will be the “quickest production car ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVL4lI"&gt;The event, which will be held at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, CA, will be livestreamed for the public starting at 7PM PT / 10PM ET. It was originally scheduled for June 3rd, but Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed it to the 10th&lt;/a&gt; after tweeting that the vehicle needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLuJqJ"&gt;The delivery of the refreshed Model S has also been delayed, with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;originally stating&lt;/a&gt; that it expected to begin shipping to customers in March. A revamped version of the Model X SUV was also expected to begin deliveries in March but has been pushed to an unspecified future date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aIeQOb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Model S Plaid delivery event at our Fremont factory will be streamed live on June 10, 7pm Pacific &lt;a href="https://t.co/V7c77ySFti"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V7c77ySFti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tesla (@Tesla) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1401992031073886212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XW7ms"&gt;The Plaid Model S wasn’t inevitable. Despite persistent rumors for years, Musk seemed uninterested in the idea, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1148443699858292736?lang=en"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that “[t]here is no ‘refreshed’ Model X or Model S coming.” Tesla instead was constantly making minor improvements to both vehicles, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTCANQ"&gt;But less than two months later, a prototype version of the Plaid powertrain made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;debut at the Laguna Seca raceway&lt;/a&gt;, lapping the famous California racetrack in just one minute and 36 seconds. The company later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;showed off another prototype as part of its Battery Day presentation&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020. Plaid, much like the “Ludicrous” acceleration mode in Tesla’s cars, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0"&gt;is a reference to one of Musk’s favorite movies, &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jd6NRG"&gt;We already know most of the relevant specs: an estimated range of 390 miles, a top speed of 200mph (with the “right tires,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354620643967438855?s=20"&gt;Musk has said&lt;/a&gt;), and a 0–60mph sprint in 1.99 seconds (although &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yigpPSu_o"&gt;there’s been some questions&lt;/a&gt; about the validity of that last claim). The new model is priced at $129,990, compared to $79,990 for a long-range Model S. A “Plaid Plus” version of the Model S, which was supposed to have a range of more than 520 miles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22521769/elon-musk-tweets-tesla-plaid-plus-canceled"&gt;was canceled&lt;/a&gt; after Musk tweeted that basic Plaid is “just so good.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWYf1w"&gt;The new Model S will also feature a simplified interior, with a landscape touchscreen similar to what’s found in the Model 3 and Model Y. There’s also a stalkless U-shaped butterfly steering wheel, much like what Tesla has said will appear in the forthcoming second-generation Roadster. And there’s an added screen behind the center console for rear-seat passengers. Unlike the Model 3 and Model Y, the new Model S still features a cockpit screen behind the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7MdCtMS0l1fSySlSruXRLH5HCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650063/0x0_ModelS_14.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENiPhjaouJlz3HrHlYaAgquEPK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650062/0x0_ModelS_13.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MrpUCg"&gt;Tesla says that the Plaid Model S should be able to do five times as many quarter-mile runs as previous Model S sedans, thanks to the new powertrain and the new heat pump that was developed for the Model Y. It will also come with an infotainment system that’s powered by a chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop"&gt;capable of 10 teraflops of processing power&lt;/a&gt;, allowing passengers to play games like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; (with wireless controller support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0Ltyo"&gt;When it first launched in 2012, the Tesla Model S redefined electric luxury, with a sleek design and long driving range. But the company is facing a new wave of competition, with the release in recent years of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-tron GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes EQS&lt;/a&gt;. If Tesla wants to stay in the luxury EV game, it needed to make some changes to its flagship vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yhljhT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Tesla wants to stay in the luxury EV game, it needed to make some changes to its flagship vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxubKn"&gt;The abrupt cancellation of Plaid Plus, however, is raising questions about the automaker’s battery plans. Plaid Plus was supposed to feature Tesla’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;tabless 4680 battery cells&lt;/a&gt;. These cells, which are supposed to enable longer ranges of 500 miles or more, are bigger than the company’s current cells, measuring 46 millimeters by 80 millimeters (thus the name). In addition to more energy and power, the new cells are expected to result in a 14 percent reduction in cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) at the cell form factor level only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks6oa1"&gt;Plaid Plus was supposed to get a range of 520 miles. While Musk could shock everyone Thursday night with a longer range Plaid than originally advertised, he also recently threw cold water on the idea of needing ranges longer than 400 miles. In a &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/06/elon-musk-tesla-canceling-model-s-plaid-need-400-mile-range/"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said “more range doesn’t really matter. There are essentially zero trips above 400 miles where the driver doesn’t need to stop for restroom, food, coffee, etc. anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzIIB"&gt;Ignoring for a moment that most restroom breaks last shorter than the time it takes to recharge an electric vehicle, Musk’s reversal on Plaid Plus could signal a delay in the production of Tesla’s 4680 battery cells. In addition to Plaid, the new cells are supposed to be used in Tesla’s Cybertruck and Semi vehicles, which are still expected later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiDhPp"&gt;In an April earnings call, Musk said that Tesla was still “12... to 18 months away from volume production of 4680.” It remains to be seen whether we’ll get an update on that estimate at the event Thursday evening. But with Musk, you never know for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbDIdsB8AyFH5gNMa9_bSViPs5k=/0x133:1690x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434102/824_2021_06_07_824_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ksqI6"&gt;Apple’s new health features will be available for anyone with an iPhone. But two of the tools announced at WWDC 2021, walking steadiness and the ability to share health data with family members, could be particularly useful for older adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOBiA0"&gt;People who work with older adults are excited that a company like Apple is interested in tech that could be used for this group. Experts have spent years frustrated that companies don’t design products to meet the needs of that demographic. There have been a few attempts to introduce new tools, but none got much traction, says Richard Schulz, a social psychologist studying aging at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXROR"&gt;“I think the reason is that the big boys — companies like Apple — never got into it,” Schulz says. The new features are a signal that the tide is starting to turn. “Apple getting into this is a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EzfAG0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of falling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gUjfyk"&gt;The first feature, the walking steadiness indicator, targets a major issue for older adults: falling. Falls are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/older-adult-falls/index.html"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of accidents, injury, and death for seniors in the US, and they’re responsible for billions in healthcare costs each year. Researchers have been studying falls — and trying to figure out ways to prevent them — for decades, says ‪Jacob Sosnoff‬, who studies mobility in the department of physical therapy and rehabilitation science at the University of Kansas Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GShEH"&gt;“We can do a really good job in the lab measuring walking impairment and making predictions and recommendations, but we’re not very good in the real world,” Sosnoff says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYMN0E"&gt;Apple’s new walking steadiness feature aims to track people as they move through their daily lives. It uses metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground to monitor how stable a user is. It can only be measured on the iPhone, not an Apple Watch, because some of the metrics have to be calculated from as close to the hip as possible, Apple says — so in a pocket or a bag works best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMjGjD"&gt;Apple Watch already has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt; feature that can prompt users to call emergency services or automatically make a call if the user is immobile for around a minute. The new iPhone capability focuses on prediction, rather than response: it can tell people if they’re walking steadily and issue an alert if it thinks they’re at an increased risk of falling. Apple says the system is based on data collected during a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; that included over 100,000 participants of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ljt9QL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Having people be aware of their fall risk is important”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52srye"&gt;There are no major commercial products that track the quality of people’s movement, Sosnoff says. Until now, most movement trackers have focused on how much people moved. “That’s why there’s a lot of excitement about this,” he says. “Having people be aware of their fall risk is important.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMYTXH"&gt;But there’s also a downside to telling people that they might fall — fear of falling is linked to actually experiencing a fall. If alerts increase that fear, people might limit their physical activity or even stop leaving the house as much, says Clara Berridge, a professor at the University of Washington who studies healthcare technology in aging populations. “That will likely contribute to their actual risk of falling, because they’re decreasing their strength and activity,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9EKJ3"&gt;It’s a fine balance, Sosnoff says. “We want people to be aware of the risks but not so overly concerned that they don’t do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeJu5B"&gt;Sosnoff says he’s eager to see if the walking steadiness feature could actually reduce falls in real-world scenarios. One challenge for the tool could be monitoring people whose walking is impaired — like people with a limp, for example. Algorithms that track gait often don’t work as well in those situations, he says. If the Apple feature has that problem, it could flag people with different walking patterns who might not actually be a fall risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMxUFg"&gt;The Apple feature may not be able to help everyone at fall risk. Walking patterns are only one of the many reasons people fall: poor eyesight with age can cause people to trip, certain medications can reduce balance, and items around the house (like loose rugs) can be hazardous. The Apple walking steadiness feature is designed to suggest that people who are at risk of falling do various stability exercises, which can be useful in some cases. But for some people, balance may not be the main problem. “Getting prompted to do exercises isn’t the only solution,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kyioTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rbb8oE"&gt;Getting information on a user’s walk also requires that they carry their phone around regularly. Sosnoff says he’s not sure older adults actually do. Many may use their phones in different ways than younger people. “I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeiGI"&gt;There are advantages, though, to having a player like Apple working on falls. “They’re going to have a significant amount of data to help see what’s going on,” Sosnoff says. If the iPhone could actually prevent falls, it’d be a huge boon. “We put people back together again if they fall and get hurt, but we don’t really do much to stop the fall. It would be exciting if we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="S6B7H1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8YOgpd"&gt;Apple will also now let users share their health data with other people. The feature could be a major convenience for family members and caregivers of older adults, who may want or need to keep track of someone’s health metrics. Currently, they might have to collect information from multiple different sources — a heart rate app, a blood pressure monitor system. The Apple sharing feature could give them direct access in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rpjt7n"&gt;“I could see this being extremely appealing for adult children,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foxb1Z"&gt;It also raises privacy concerns for older adults. The Apple feature is controlled entirely by the user, who gets to decide in the app what information they want shared and with whom. In reality, though, older people who aren’t comfortable with technology may not be able to take charge of that decision themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GukAx"&gt;“It’s very common to have an adult child purchase a phone for an older adult, and set up the settings, and take the phone out of their hand and say, ‘let me just fix it for you,’” Berridge says. “That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAgHDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1hsRR"&gt;Some people might be very comfortable opening up their Health app to family members, but there’s still a power dynamic involved. Older adults tend to like monitoring technology less than their adult children, and say they want to maintain their privacy without feeling watched. But their adult children are confident that they can convince parents to use monitoring technology, even if they say they’re uncomfortable with it, Berridge’s research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102442/"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re not necessarily inclined to engage them in the conversation, they’re just very confident that their preferences would rule at the end of the day,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YORt02"&gt;On the flip side, adult children who use this feature might find themselves inundated with information about their older parents that they’re not sure how to interpret, says social psychologist Schulz. “Decisions have to be made about how that information is parsed and translated for the person who’s getting access,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyIhsr"&gt;In practice, Berridge isn’t sure how useful it would be to have a family member see all of the Health app data. “People may say, okay, what do I do with this information exactly? At what point is it meaningful, when do I call a doctor, and so on. It could be an alert overload situation, too.” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biuqC2"&gt;Despite those concerns, there’s increasing interest in ways to keep older adults healthy at home. The COVID-19 pandemic showed that senior care facilities can be dangerous, and people generally don’t want to live in them, Berridge says. The new features from Apple highlight movement in that direction. “Moving the monitoring out of facilities and into the home is going to be a major trend,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2TrfS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Record labels sue Roblox for letting users upload pirated songs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Holiday’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAuhRRK-KRwMIHArBZjXs4lsm7Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434047/LNX_Concert_HOLIDAY.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tIIML"&gt;The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) has sued &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; for letting users upload music from Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, deadmau5, and other artists without paying a licensing fee. &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912.1.0.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit seeks&lt;/a&gt; $200 million in damages and a court order that will make &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; crack down on piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FHKre"&gt;The NMPA filed suit yesterday on behalf of several major music publishers. It accuses &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;massively popular, kid-focused platform&lt;/a&gt; for games and social experiences — of hosting a shared library of copyrighted but unlicensed songs. The complaint alleges that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively preys on its impressionable user base and their desire for popular music, teaching children that pirating music is perfectly acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KeRkpr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Roblox’ allows a prodigious level of infringing material”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ucvZMc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; offers a library of audio files, 3D models, and other assets for building experiences. Users upload these files themselves, but the NMPA claims &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively encourages” adding popular songs. It also notes that users pay for uploading audio files with in-game currency. “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; allows a prodigious level of infringing material through its gates, purposely turning a blind eye for the sake of profit,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94QiQ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/06/addressing-recently-filed-litigation-certain-music-publishers/"&gt;responded to the complaint&lt;/a&gt; on its website. “We are surprised and disappointed by this lawsuit which represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; platform operates, and will defend &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; vigorously as we work to achieve a fair resolution,” the statement says. It notes that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has partnered with music labels for authorized events &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;like a Lil Nas X concert&lt;/a&gt; last year, and the company &lt;a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/upcoming-music-changes-and-copyright-related-action/130570"&gt;signed a licensing deal&lt;/a&gt; with APM Music in 2018. “We do not tolerate copyright infringement, which is why we use industry-leading, advanced filtering technology to detect and prohibit unauthorized recordings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwvkEJ"&gt;As the complaint notes, searching &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s library for exact names like “Ed Sheeran” or “Ariana Grande” returns no results. But searching for partial terms like “Sheeran” or “Ariana” will pull up tracks labeled with popular songs from both artists. (Not all the labels are accurate — one file titled “Ed Sheeran - The Shape Of You” is actually a sound clip from &lt;em&gt;The Purge, &lt;/em&gt;for instance.) “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s use of filtering technology has been nothing more than an empty gesture to mask its long history of instigating, inducing, and encouraging users, including children, to infringe copyrighted music,” the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UVsbR"&gt;Virtually all big web platforms clash with record labels at some point, and the disputes often end with the companies striking a deal. The NMPA and Google &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/08/music-publishers-youtube-end-spat-061592"&gt;settled a similar lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over YouTube copyright infringement in 2011, leading to the platform’s current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16796058/youtube-universal-music-group-sony-agreement-royalties"&gt;royalty-sharing agreement&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside the news of this lawsuit, the NMPA announced a “major ramp-up” of copyright takedown notices against Twitch — pressuring parent company Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534983/riaa-copyright-twitch-streamers-licensing-letter"&gt;into expanding&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;currently limited licensing deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Control is free on the Epic Games Store for one week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EQ5MA_s-OOH7Bc9HDPyC-wyJ64=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433983/Drifter_combat.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNoH1s"&gt;Remedy’s excellent supernatural thriller &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is available for free on the Epic Games Store from now until June 17th at 11AM ET. All you need is an Epic Games account — just log in to the store while the deal is live, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/control"&gt;claim your copy of the game for PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdjoPp"&gt;If you haven’t played &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; before, I highly recommend picking it up. I really liked exploring the game’s spooky paranormal world, and using protagonist Jesse Faden’s psychic abilities to fling objects from the environment at enemies is a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIMqD0"&gt;Epic is offering &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale"&gt;Mega Sale&lt;/a&gt;, which also runs through June 17th. Like last year, Epic is offering its $10 Epic Coupons that are applied automatically at checkout on eligible games that cost $14.99 or more during the sale. There are also some big discounts on hit games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x7Fvxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Epic’s Mega Sale returns with free NBA 2K21 and deals on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Cyberpunk 2077, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445708/epic-games-mega-sale-free-deals-coupons"},{"title":"Control is an excellent supernatural thriller with hints of Metroid","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The Hoover Dam reservoir is at an all-time low </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tourists Visit The Hoover Dam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChAsHArl0uxSV2BwTQkG0S7c74c=/0x0:4974x3316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433928/1253437187.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A general view of Lake Mead, a human-made lake that lies on the Colorado River, about 24 miles southeast of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the states of Nevada and Arizona, on December 21st, 2019, in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada. Formed by the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States and serves water to the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada, as well as some of Mexico, providing sustenance to nearly 20 million people and large areas of farmland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paul Rovere / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FKF81y"&gt;Lake Mead, the reservoir created by the Hoover Dam, that feeds water to 25 million people across Western states, is historically low. On June 9th, the water level dipped to &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/levels.html"&gt;1,071.57&lt;/a&gt; feet above sea level, narrowly beating a &lt;a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2016/05/19/lake-mead-declines-new-record-low/84597120/"&gt;record low&lt;/a&gt; last set in &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/lakemead_line.pdf"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaQJpU"&gt;The lake surface has dropped 140 feet since 2000, leaving the reservoir just 37 percent full. With such a dramatic drop, officials expect to declare an official &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/05/27/hoover-dam-drought-water-levels-lake-mead/5134031001/"&gt;water shortage&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever. That could affect water and energy that Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam deliver to Arizona, California, and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPeCDY"&gt;Water levels at Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, are &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/24mo/2021/MAY21.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to keep dropping throughout the year. The drought tugging at the lake’s water levels is affecting other states in the region, too. “Please join me and Utahns, regardless of religious affiliation, in a weekend of humble prayer for rain,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in a video plea last week. He declared a state of emergency in March as Utah, like much of the West, plunged deep into drought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GPrABk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amid dangerous drought conditions, we’re inviting all Utahns — regardless of religious affiliation — to join us this weekend in collective and humble prayer for rain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/uJzFARl7BI"&gt;https://t.co/uJzFARl7BI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HS755aXEy3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HS755aXEy3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Utah Gov.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5y0G6"&gt;The West is ablaze in deep red and burgundy on drought &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; for the US, signaling “extreme” to “exceptional drought.” Farmers, who are already abandoning crops for lack of water, are &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/environment/article/Pulling-out-trees-trucking-water-for-cows-16234207.php"&gt;feeling the strain&lt;/a&gt; the most. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A snapshot of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Drought Monitor on June 1st, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-lGE6g3CR0n9C2D5Ybs9C-AInU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649983/usdroughtmonitor_weekly_ndmc__web__2021_06_01.png"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SPHStz"&gt;It didn’t help that a sweltering spring &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/04/heat-wave-united-states/"&gt;heatwave&lt;/a&gt; hit much of the continental US this past weekend. Las Vegas, some 30 miles from Lake Mead, reached 109 degrees Fahrenheit and could see even higher temperatures &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/weather/looming-heat-wave-could-push-173024866.html"&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;. Altogether, the drought and heat are scary omens for this year’s fire season. An above-normal risk of fire is &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;forecasted&lt;/a&gt; for the Southwest through June, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8T2B2"&gt;In July, the Southwest’s monsoon season is expected to kick in and provide some relief — at least temporarily. &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/"&gt;Climate change has brought on&lt;/a&gt; higher spring and summer temperatures, more severe wildfires, less snow (which much of the West relies on for water), and more intense dry seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWk2Qv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with true wireless earbuds. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut, even outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H3uSbA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Right now, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodsDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$146 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to $200 or lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163118618412109#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are also currently selling the AirPods Pro for $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHhsSe"&gt;The recently-launched AirPods Max have yet to receive a steep discount, but right now you can pick up the silver, blue, and space gray configurations at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $30 off their initial retail price, bringing your total to $520. It’s not much, however, it’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the AirPods Max to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus updates its midrange Nord with new processor and a headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFsKI0A7E2BNkz8JgQoLdp3_6po=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433448/OnePlus_Nord_CE_5G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G will be available in black, blue, and silver.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPgJcu"&gt;OnePlus has announced a new addition to its lineup of midrange phones, the Nord CE. According to the company, the “CE” stands for “Core Edition,” an indication that the company is focusing on the fundamentals, rather than inflating the device’s spec sheet with unnecessary extras. The phone is launching in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egSlyU"&gt;What this focus on the fundamentals means in practice is that the Nord CE is slightly stripped down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;last year’s Nord&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s slightly higher-specced than its predecessor, too. So you’re getting a higher-resolution 64-megapixel main camera (up from 48 megapixels), but there are only three rear sensors in total. (There’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide with a 119-degree field of view and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor.) The Nord CE also only has a single 16-megapixel selfie camera, with no secondary ultrawide like the original Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOENK9aP_B8wGZ-Jdf9g3RrqxqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650055/Nord_CE_all_three_colours.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone features a very similar design to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mMJRZa"&gt;Internally, there’s a Snapdragon 750G powering this year’s model, compared to the 765G in last year’s phone. OnePlus claims its CPU is 20 percent faster, while its GPU is 10 percent faster. That’s paired with a choice of 6, 8, or 12GB of RAM, although these options vary slightly based on region. There’s a 4,500mAh battery inside the Nord CE, up from 4,115mAh last year, and the phone supports Warp Charge 30T Plus fast charging, which OnePlus says should charge you from 0 to 70 percent in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naiktt"&gt;Externally, the Nord CE looks very similar to its predecessor. It’s got a very similarly styled camera bump on the back left (though with three rather than four cameras) and a hole-punch for its selfie camera on the front of the phone (again, with one rather than two cameras). However, on the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a headphone jack, which was missing from last year’s device. In terms of display, the Nord CE comes with a 6.43-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED panel. The phone is available in blue, black, or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n6EZm"&gt;The Nord CE will be available to preorder in limited quantities from OnePlus itself starting today in the UK, and these devices will ship on June 14th. The device goes on general sale on June 21st. In the UK, it starts at £299 (€329) for the model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and £369 (€399) for the model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. In Europe, there’s a version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which will retail for €299. Those prices are slightly cheaper than the original Nord, which started at £379 (€399) for its 8GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzkoZL"&gt;Like the original Nord, OnePlus says it doesn’t have plans to release the Nord CE in the US. Instead, the US has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; to look forward to. It’s a successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;N100&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus CEO Pete Lau recently confirmed will retail for under $250.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside the cryptocurrency scam vortex</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustrated Dogecoin surrounded by warning signs." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ysyLh3NaVx6zZY1yCpca7z4cCro=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433362/VRG_4614_9_Dogecoin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lpbuE"&gt;On May 22nd, a crypto finance project called DeFi100 posted a message to its website: “We scammed you guys and you can’t do shit about it. HA HA. All you moon bois have been scammed and you can’t do shit about it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk05mT"&gt;Screenshots of the message immediately went viral on crypto Twitter (always anarchic, easily risible). A popular anonymous crypto-tracking Twitter account called Mr. Whale &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoWhale/status/1396100822245777408"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that DeFi100 had run off with $32 million. Cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-may-have-absconded-with-32m-in-investor-funds"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-231952405.html"&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, ran with the number. The project owners &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DEFI100/status/1396489770281226244"&gt;denied any foul play&lt;/a&gt;, and it soon became clear the message was a website hack rather than a serious warning — but by then, it was too late. Panic had set in, and the price of the underlying coin was in free fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUWfTV"&gt;“We never stole any funds,” a representative for the project told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “DeFi100 was a very small project, and we were not holding any investors’ funds, so there are no questions of scamming people or running away with their funds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kb9pdg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s little recourse when crypto investments turn out to be scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBL8TO"&gt;DeFi100’s problems are a small part of the picture, but they’re a reminder of the dangers of the ongoing crypto boom. Despite billions of dollars pouring into the space in recent months, there’s still little recourse when investments turn out to be scams. Most importantly, the radical decentralization of the blockchain means there is simply no way to get your money back — and few assurances that an unproven vendor will keep their promises once the transaction goes through. The result is a new gold rush in crypto scams, as speculators seek ever more obscure opportunities and riskier bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwuLJY"&gt;The DeFi100 project’s website is now back online, but rumors persist about what actually happened. Certik, a popular blockchain security leaderboard, does &lt;a href="https://www.certik.org/"&gt;currently list DeFi100&lt;/a&gt; as a “rug pull,” which is a term for a scam where the founders of a project raise investment money and run. (The project owners say a rug pull would be impossible since they never held investor funds.) It’s just one of a string of scams that today’s crypto holders need to watch out for, along with sketchy altcoins, Discord pump-and-dumps, Elon Musk impersonators, and more &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/don-t-blame-crypto-for-ransomware"&gt;malicious forms of cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHj5Ln"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marenaltman?lang=en"&gt;Maren Altman&lt;/a&gt;, a TikTok influencer with over a million followers who creates videos about cryptocurrency and astrology, there are three kinds of risk that crypto holders should be wary of: bad investments, collapsing projects, and outright scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EyliYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subreddits like r/cryptocurrency are awash with accusations of “scam coins”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMDsbB"&gt;The first and most common kind of risk is simple bad investments in obscure coins. Outside of major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are thousands of smaller coins built on the blockchain technology, promising huge rewards if the coin ever comes to prominence. Subreddits like r/cryptocurrency are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=scam%20coin&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1"&gt;awash with accusations&lt;/a&gt; of “scam coins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHbDgO"&gt;“I mean, I’m in a handful of those myself, where it’s just the investment, it was a promise, the development didn’t go through, and I’m still waiting,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8aBYO"&gt;Trying to research obscure altcoins can be confusing for inexperienced traders. Links to cryptocurrency Discord servers often pop up on Twitter, promising an easy pump-and-dump of a smaller crypto coin. Or more confusingly, Twitter bots will accuse Discord servers that don’t exist of pump-and-dumps, hoping to drive up value for a separate coin. But while they promise easy money, the reality is less enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7YqX2"&gt;Another risk is the oftentimes innocent but unfortunate mismanagement of funds. In a bullish crypto market, everyone thinks they have a revolutionary idea involving cryptocurrency. And, obviously, &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-cryptocurrency-sector-is-overflowing-with-dead-projects"&gt;a lot of them don’t pan out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOahDk"&gt;“Things not being clarified, errors in contract, or just a weak link in the development circle,” Altman explained, “leading to mismanagement of money and people not having their investment turn out as expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuJOo8"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cryptocurrency-failures-all-time/"&gt;extremely well-known example&lt;/a&gt; of this was the DAO project. It launched in the spring of 2016 to huge fanfare, only to be completely defunct by the fall of the same year. The project was created by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization and was an attempt to build a venture capital fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Only a month or two in, a hacker &lt;a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao"&gt;found a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in the token’s code and made off with $50 million. Traders started selling off DAO tokens en masse and the price never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0STOrY"&gt;Sometimes this chaos can end in outright fraud. According to the Federal Trade Commission, crypto-based financial scams &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2021/05/cryptocurrency-buzz-drives-record-investment-scam-losses"&gt;are at an all-time high&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the surging interest in cryptocurrency. And the line between well-meaning blunder and crypto Ponzi scheme is blurry. Just ask investors of OneCoin or PayCoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZgDZXe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In 2019, PayCoin founder Homero Joshua Garza was sentenced to 21 months in prison&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CAHnMO"&gt;OneCoin launched in the mid-2010s and was billed as an educational crypto trading service. It turns out the OneCoin tokens being purchased by investors &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/4b-ponzi-scheme-onecoin-and-cryptoqueen-leader-found-in-default-in-us-lawsuit"&gt;weren’t actually on the blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. It was accused of being a Ponzi scheme and its founders ran off with close to $4 billion. It &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/06/is-onecoin-the-biggest-financial-fraud-in-history/"&gt;has been called&lt;/a&gt; one of the biggest financial scams in history. One of its founders, Ruja Ignatova, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84"&gt;is still missing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVXyiY"&gt;In 2019, PayCoin founder Homero Joshua Garza &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/cryptocurrency-fraudster-sentenced-021119"&gt;was sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution after he created his own cryptocurrency and offered it to investors with the assurance that he had secured a $100 million reserve of capital. There was no reserve, and the whole project &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoManiaks/crypto-scams-like-pay-coin-will-you-be-their-next-victim-medium-a8f6575daff8"&gt;ended up losing $9 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQDUX2"&gt;But even with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-31/roshun-patel-on-what-really-happened-during-the-crypto-market-crash"&gt;May 2021’s sizable dip&lt;/a&gt; in value for big coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cryptocurrency is more popular than ever, and legions of inexperienced traders are learning the hard way what a peer-to-peer financial service actually means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiSBl2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajKA"&gt;Neeraj Agrawal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of communications for Coin Center, one of the US’s biggest cryptocurrency advocacy groups, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that wildly speculative coins (known colloquially as “shitcoins”) are now a permanent part of the cryptocurrency space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLWsZT"&gt;“The insane speculative garbage coins are not going to go away,” Agrawal says. “That’s just part of the world now. And it sort of remains to us to show that the really good projects are worth their existence, that there is actual value here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6TEpW"&gt;That’s particularly hard when crypto celebrities like Elon Musk are driving interest toward the wackier end of the crypto space. Musk recently fueled the massive spike in interest around Dogecoin, a failed crypto coin invented as a joke that’s named after the famous Shiba Inu meme. Musk’s tweets have also been blamed for &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/24/investing/elon-musk-bitcoin-dogecoin-tesla/index.html"&gt;this month’s massive market downturn&lt;/a&gt;. It’s &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/experts-answer-how-does-elon-musk-affect-crypto-space"&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; what effect Musk has on the market, but his recent branding as the main character of crypto has led to a litany of Musk-themed scams. According to the FTC, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/elon-musk-impersonators-stole-more-than-2-million-in-crypto-scams-.html"&gt;people impersonating Musk&lt;/a&gt; have managed to scam at least $2 million from traders this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KEe0bK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A market really only requires two things ... a seller and a buyer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78vEIL"&gt;“Maybe that’s the biggest risk to crypto users — your own stupidity,” joked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem"&gt;Meltem Demirors&lt;/a&gt;, the chief strategy officer of digital-asset investment firm CoinShares. “I think people just aren’t accustomed to taking responsibility for their financial lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqjBBX"&gt;In fact, I was asked by both a family member and a close friend this month about an obscure cryptocurrency called Dogelon Mars. It’s currently worth $0.00000016 USD, but the two people close to me were considering buying a bunch of it because they mistakenly believed that, due to the name and its frankly &lt;a href="https://dogelon.io/"&gt;confusing description&lt;/a&gt;, it was a coin launched by Musk himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pf04S"&gt;Demirors told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Dogelon Mars was actually one of her favorite meme coins. “We have to remember, right, the whole point of a lot of this is permission-less financial innovation,” she says. “And a market really only requires two things. It requires a seller and a buyer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPjMuM"&gt;She said this was the main explanation behind the recent NFT explosion. People had crypto coins on hand and wanted to see what they could spend them on. Turns out what they wanted to buy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;surreal internet art&lt;/a&gt; for millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLLA76"&gt;“I always think it’s really funny when people are all about crypto and permission-less financial innovation, but then the minute they lose money, they become like the most statist people imaginable,” Demirors said. “You really can’t have it both ways. Like you bought this shitcoin. You now need to make your bed and lie in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the Summer Game Fest’s ‘Kickoff Live’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YICq9gnIIpn96EkLdl644mEgG4M=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433303/E3JlJZNVcAE73j6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Summer Game Fest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRI49d"&gt;Summer Game Fest 2021, hosted by Geoff Keighley, is getting started with new game announcements two days ahead of E3 2021 with its “Kickoff Live” event. In addition to news, it’s perhaps the only event to feature both an appearance from Jeff Goldblum and a musical performance by Weezer. The list of partners for the preview event includes 2K, Activision, Blizzard, Capcom, InnerSloth, Epic Games, Sony PlayStation, Riot Games, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Microsoft Xbox, and more. Here’s how to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jv5JaK"&gt;When does Summer Game Fest start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HTaFNL"&gt;The kickoff show is happening this Thursday, June 10th at 2PM ET / 11AM PT / 6PM GMT. And like last year’s happenings, it’s all online, so you can just hang out at home and watch all of the announcements from your PC, phone, or TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q22D1o"&gt;Like last year, there will likely be more Summer Game Fest events throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1mF4aA"&gt;Where can I stream Summer Game Fest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SVbwU1"&gt;This game event is being hosted on several platforms, giving you plenty of options. It’s being livestreamed on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MqXeohrnoaY"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (we’ve embedded the video above that’ll go live later), as well as &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
