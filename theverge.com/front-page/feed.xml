    <title>Microsoft Edge gets new colorful themes, sleeping tabs feature, and password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkt5-8f8_Xuvoezp-jp4cLBizek=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700591/E0rmVyN.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkRQhf"&gt;Microsoft is introducing new colorful themes for its Edge browser this week, alongside updated icons and a new sleeping tabs feature that improves the browser and overall PC performance. To celebrate a year of the Chromium-powered Microsoft Edge, the browser is getting new themes available from the &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/microsoft-edge-themes"&gt;Edge add-on site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u87OiG"&gt;Themes range from simple colors all the way to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon&lt;/em&gt; themes. These new themes will include colors on new tab pages, tabs, the address bar, and other parts of the Edge browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_y0b-7_ta8XGIl-p6VTajMLDhAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250349/microsoftedgethemes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Edge themes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zOnzUC"&gt;Microsoft is also updating the icons used throughout Edge to better match the company’s Fluent Design system. “In our latest release you’ll notice subtle updates to icons in Microsoft Edge that are rounder and softer in appearance,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/01/21/this-year-lets-resolve-to-make-the-most-of-our-time-online-and-better-protect-ourselves-from-online-threats/"&gt;explains Liat Ben-Zur&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft executive working on the company’s “Modern Life” initiative. “This is just the beginning of our design journey and we’re already imagining how to bring Fluent design throughout our products. We can’t wait to share more of our vision in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSIF0D"&gt;The general look and feel of Edge might be changing, but Microsoft is also adding in some useful features, too. A new sleeping tabs feature is rolling out now, and it aims to improve the browser’s performance. Edge will now automatically release system resources for inactive tabs when you have a number of tabs open, which will help new tabs run better or stop the browser from hogging memory and CPU resources in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mUl9dXxN4UR_YWCNzIV-h3It1RA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250355/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Password_Generator_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Edge password suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T0QuOn"&gt;Microsoft is also taking steps to roll out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"&gt;new password manager&lt;/a&gt; features. Edge will start automatically suggesting a secure and complex password when you sign up on a new website or attempt to change an existing password. Edge will also be getting &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/01/21/edge-88-privacy/"&gt;a new password monitor feature&lt;/a&gt; that will alert you if your password has leaked online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBxDvq"&gt;If that wasn’t enough, Edge history and tab sync is finally rolling out to everyone this week. These features started rolling out to a number of countries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216644/microsoft-edge-history-tab-sync-features-available-rolling-out"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Edge users to finally sync their full web history and active tabs across multiple devices including iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG adds a reputation system ‘to help keep things more civil while you kill each other’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/28upopmErbIbbyJVCixkTMapKXg=/0x0:1130x753/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700587/6.reputation_1365x768.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;PUBG&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: PUBG Corporation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJ0H4u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s latest update adds a reputation system intended to encourage players to be less toxic toward each other. Though, in a blog about the update, PUBG Corporation acknowledges the inherent irony of a reputation system in a game all about killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLWqMo"&gt;“Keeping in-game interactions healthy is important to us,” the developers wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.pubg.com/en-us/2021/01/18/console-update-10-2-patch-notes/"&gt;the blog&lt;/a&gt;. “We know passions can run high on the Battlegrounds, but toxic behavior is never justified. To help keep things more civil while you kill each other, we’re introducing a new Reputation System to &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CheFJ5"&gt;The new system gives you a reputation level between zero and five, and your reputation will naturally go up “as long as you are not exhibiting toxic or otherwise disruptive behaviour.” Things that can make your reputation go down include abandoning matches and being reported for verbal abuse. Being banned for violating &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s terms of service can also reduce your reputation level, according to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ebz-f6DwAGXCfbLHo3Wz5IYrAM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250307/7._______1365x768.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The reputation system in &lt;/em&gt;PUBG&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4hVtgX"&gt;The new 10.2 update also adds a new vintage sports car to the game, the Coupe RB, the ability to do random stunts in midair while riding dirt bikes, and more. You can read up on the new reputation system and everything else added to the game &lt;a href="https://www.pubg.com/en-us/2021/01/18/console-update-10-2-patch-notes/"&gt;in the patch notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gaze in wonder at this astonishingly high-res scan of an iconic painting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Girl with a Pearl Earring by Jan Vermeer" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrsYsDOrlGHSW29tOoM3AHucj7o=/0x463:3876x3047/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700567/587831670.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG Wilson / Corbis via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kSNtzz"&gt;For the past hour, I’ve been avoiding work by browsing &lt;a href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/"&gt;this amazingly high-resolution scan&lt;/a&gt; of Johannes Vermeer’s iconic &lt;em&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/em&gt;. With a total resolution of 93,205 x 108,565, &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/01/20/astounding-detail-a-10-billion-pixel-panorama-of-vermeers-girl-with-a-pearl-earring/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PetaPixel &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; the scan is believed to be the first 10 billion pixel panorama ever created, allowing you to zoom in close enough to turn the tiniest flecks of paint into puddles and minuscule cracks into crevasses. The scan appears to have been posted online &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mauritshuis/status/1255068605378703360"&gt;early last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9WM5Ms"&gt;Like a lot of museums, the Mauritshuis gallery, which normally houses the work, recently had to temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/visit/plan-your-visit/#:~:text=In%20connection%20with%20the%20nationally,case%20until%2019%20January%202021."&gt;close due to COVID restrictions&lt;/a&gt;. But for the time being, this scan is a nice replacement. In some ways, it’s actually better, letting you press your virtual nose up against the painting in a way that’d get you thrown out of most art galleries or scolded by an irate assistant at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfJ1AClnnJWNzJGvesg6GgeLkP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250253/msedge_ZbqAyGnPrs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/" target="_blank"&gt;Hirox-Europe.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3wOc71EcS0qtUtI4g-Kh3aRUe8A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250254/msedge_xAl3OGD9By.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/" target="_blank"&gt;Hirox-Europe.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b8TMZemfiEQbbX_jHDUng2bg-SE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250255/msedge_4AKJy9IbVL.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/" target="_blank"&gt;Hirox-Europe.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0TqSj"&gt;The scan is the work of Hirox’s Emilien Leonhardt and Vincent Sabatier, who photographed the painting using a high-resolution microscope back in March 2018. Scanning the painting involved taking around 9,100 photographs of it using a high-resolution microscope before stitching them together. The resulting scan allowed the team to assess its condition, learn more about Vermeer’s painting technique, and understand past restorations of the work. You can learn more about the scanning process in the short video Hirox published below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k4kYcM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKaZYTwmjwU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gb2cdq"&gt;The 2D image is one thing, but where things get especially interesting is with &lt;a href="http://www.hirox-europe.com/PEARL/3D/"&gt;the 3D scans&lt;/a&gt;, which cover 10 specific areas of the painting like the subject’s eyes and iconic earring. These scans let you peer at sections of the painting from any angle and see that its apparent flat surface is anything but, thanks to the layers of dried paint that make up the painting. There’s even a small virtual light you can drag around inside the program to see how these surface imperfections cast a shadow over their surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E12ZaF"&gt;To learn more about what these scans and other technical research show about this painting, check out &lt;a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/restoration-and-research/girl-in-the-spotlight/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the Mauritshuis last year. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/virtueel-mauritshuis/"&gt;rest of the museum has also been digitized&lt;/a&gt;, with 36 masterpieces available to view in detail. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Trump ban will be reviewed by its new Oversight Board</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QjqtGKWjfzOFqoIR_U8U0KDIinI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700536/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F01qOa"&gt;Facebook vice president Nick Clegg says the company is referring its decision to indefinitely suspend former President Trump from its platform to its newly established oversight board for a complete review. Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook account was suspended indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; on January 7th after he incited his followers to attack the US Capitol on January 6th. Six people died in the ensuing riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VeGl3"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that “the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service... are simply too great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4xFl6f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook bans Trump ‘indefinitely’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="94pyvO"&gt;“We believe our decision was necessary and right,” Clegg said in a statement. “Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSJRI3"&gt;The oversight board, established last year, is intended to provide an appeals process for Facebook’s content moderation decisions. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;oversight board took its first six cases&lt;/a&gt; in December. The board’s decisions can’t be overruled by Zuckerberg or anyone else at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yMgaU"&gt;The oversight board &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/236821561313092-oversight-board-accepts-case-on-former-us-president-trump-s-indefinite-suspension-from-facebook-and-instagram/"&gt;said in a statement Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it had agreed to take the case. “The Oversight Board has been closely following events in the United States and Facebook’s response to them, and the Board is ready to provide a thorough and independent assessment of the company’s decision,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpnPeZ"&gt;Trump’s account will remain suspended indefinitely, Clegg said in a news release pending the board’s decision. He outlined Facebook’s reasoning: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XD5x9G"&gt;Our decision to suspend then-President Trump’s access was taken in extraordinary circumstances: a US president actively fomenting a violent insurrection designed to thwart the peaceful transition of power; five people killed; legislators fleeing the seat of democracy. This has never happened before — and we hope it will never happen again. It was an unprecedented set of events which called for unprecedented action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="87coQJ"&gt;Clegg said the reaction to Facebook’s decision showed the balance it and other companies have faced when dealing with the former president and other public figures. “Some said that Facebook should have banned President Trump long ago, and that the violence on the Capitol was itself a product of social media; others that it was an unacceptable display of unaccountable corporate power over political speech,” he wrote. Politicians, he added, “remain subject to our policies banning the use of our platform to incite violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAtTpi"&gt;Facebook joined other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube/archives"&gt;social platforms that banned the former president&lt;/a&gt; after the Capitol attack. Twitter, perhaps Trump’s favorite platform, began with a temporary suspension of @realDonaldTrump that later became a permanent one. Twitter said it took the action “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230001/snapchat-trump-ban-permanently-account-january-20th-innaguration-snap"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241201/twitch-donald-trump-ban-permanent"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; also banned the former president’s accounts, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;Shopify took down the Trump campaign store&lt;/a&gt;, a main source of the “Make America Great Again” hats and other merch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PdrUxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Banning President Trump was the right decision, says Instagram’s Adam Mosseri","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gd4JcK"&gt;For the entirety of his presidency, Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms had resisted calls to ban Trump for using their platforms for everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274323/trump-twitter-glorifying-violence-minneapolis-shooting-looting-notice-restriction"&gt;threatening violence&lt;/a&gt; to attempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549258/twitter-facebook-trump-tweet-label-misinformation-ballot-count-election"&gt;undermine the November presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21548736/twitter-facebook-throttle-trump-tweet-election-theft"&gt;applied labels to false messages&lt;/a&gt; from the former president that seemed to do little to deter him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ9jnm"&gt;Clegg acknowledged that there’s an argument to be made whether private companies like Facebook should make such decisions on their own. “We agree. Every day, Facebook makes decisions about whether content is harmful, and these decisions are made according to Community Standards we have developed over many years,” he said. “It would be better if these decisions were made according to frameworks agreed by democratically accountable lawmakers. But in the absence of such laws, there are decisions that we cannot duck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcDp4b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>House leader calls for FBI investigation into Parler</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-CORONAVIRUS-HEARING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xyN6HHV_aq3FIn-PdbymzRvpd0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700406/1228671035.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bhc3Tq"&gt;On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee called for an FBI investigation into Parler’s involvement in the deadly attack on the Capitol this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0hTsc"&gt;In a letter sent to FBI Director Christopher Wray, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) called for the bureau to “conduct a robust examination of the role that the social media site Parler played” in the January 6th pro-Trump assault on the Capitol. Maloney said that the committee intends to open its own investigation and requested a meeting with FBI officials regarding the status and scope of any future investigation into the social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;House Oversight Chair &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepMaloney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RepMaloney&lt;/a&gt; writes a letter asking FBI Director Christopher Wray to "conduct a robust examination of the role that the social media site Parler played in the assault" on the Capitol on January 6. &lt;a href="https://t.co/05OODsFeEH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/05OODsFeEH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1352292829943443457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="c85SbO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/21/parler-fbi-russia-jan-6-capitol/"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Maloney said “I am going to get to the bottom of who owns and funds social media platforms like Parler that condone and create violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQW37U"&gt;In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565344/parler-funding-conservative-mercer-app-trump-twitter-facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Parler receives financial support from the conservative hedge-fund investor Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah. The Mercers are known for financially backing conservative causes and organizations like the now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199632/facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-collection-87-million-users-api-developer-restrictions"&gt;defunct Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7ZVWv"&gt;In the letter, Maloney cites several instances in which Parler users were arrested and charged for “threatening violence against elected officials” and discussed organizing groups of protests on the platform. In the days following the deadly Capitol attack, Parler has been booted from both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google’s&lt;/a&gt; app stores and forced offline after several web hosts refused to service the site. As of press time, Parler is still offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSVewX"&gt;Last week, the FBI announced that it had received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227633/doj-fbi-evidence-capitol-trump-riot-attack"&gt;over 100,000 pieces&lt;/a&gt; of digital evidence following the Capitol riot. It’s not clear how much of this evidence is unique, but FBI officials have opened &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/investigations-regarding-violence-capitol"&gt;more than 150 cases&lt;/a&gt; into individual rioters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ava DuVernay is the newest celebrity to sign a Spotify-exclusive podcasting deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 Getty Entertainment - Social Ready Content" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yo6mAy5-pkgvDODtduecjIbzAKc=/0x0:2667x1778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700306/1204520627.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rich Polk/Getty Images for ESSENCE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aWsW7W"&gt;Spotify is continuing its pursuit of podcasting talent. Today, the company announced that it’s partnering with filmmaker Ava DuVernay and her Array media collective to launch exclusive scripted and unscripted audio programming. Those shows will come out of Spotify’s Gimlet team, and Spotify didn’t offer any preview of what the new programs might entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYzHpl"&gt;DuVernay is just the latest in a string of high-profile talent deals Spotify has inked. It locked down Joe Rogan’s show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube"&gt;exclusively last year&lt;/a&gt;, as well as new shows from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294863/kim-kardashian-west-spotify-exclusive-podcast-innocence-project-deal-announced"&gt;Kim Kardashian West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176014/prince-harry-meghan-markle-podcast-spotify-exclusive-archewell-audio"&gt;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655475/spotify-signs-podcast-deal-with-the-obamas-production-company"&gt;the Obamas’ production company&lt;/a&gt; Higher Ground. It’s also acquired notable podcast networks, including Gimlet Media, Parcast, and The Ringer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGnSZt"&gt;The strategy with all these deals seems to be building out a robust catalog of programming that has something for everyone. This, in turn, could bring more people to the Spotify app and turn them into lifelong users who, ideally, also pay for a premium subscription. Spotify also sells ads against these shows, even for paying subscribers, meaning it can double dip in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87c7Ey"&gt;Meanwhile, Spotify’s facing pressure from investors who &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/spotifys-big-bet-on-podcasts-is-failing-citi-says.html"&gt;don’t see the strategy panning out&lt;/a&gt;, at least not yet. Even still, competitors like Amazon and Google have since gotten more serious about podcasting while Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/apple-mulls-podcast-subscription-push-amid-spotifys-land-grab"&gt;rumored to be considering&lt;/a&gt; launching its own subscription podcast service. Spotify now has new competition, as well as its stock market price to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lyLUgb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; creator Epic Games is turning its attention to film. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/fortnite-creator-epic-games-animated-movie-gilgamesh-1234676907/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that Epic will lend its Unreal Engine tech to animation studio Hook Up, as well as firms DuermeVela and FilmSharks, as an investment in upcoming film &lt;em&gt;Gilgamesh&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNzxjI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilgamesh&lt;/em&gt; is inspired by the mythological hero of the same name and follows its titular character on a mission to obtain immortality. Argentinian filmmaker Tomás Lipgot is set to direct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzTMIh"&gt;The film is funded by Epic’s &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants"&gt;MegaGrants initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a $100 million pledge that allows developers, educators, filmmakers, and more to use Unreal Engine for their projects. Shows like &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/hbo-s-westworld-turns-to-unreal-engine-for-in-camera-visual-effects"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have already used Unreal for camera effects and digital sets. &lt;em&gt;Gilgamesh&lt;/em&gt; will be available in both English and Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review: the real deal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;More phone, less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5nU2FD"&gt;Samsung’s “Ultra” phones are meant to be the absolute pinnacle of the company’s (non-folding) mobile technology. And so the Galaxy S21 Ultra — the third Ultra phone after the S20 and Note 20 Ultras — spares very few expenses. The price is lower than before, starting at $1,199.99, but the phone itself is a perfect example of what happens when Samsung goes all-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7yZKC"&gt;It’s also a perfect example of how Samsung often whiffs on its first attempt at something but presses on anyway, eventually achieving the original vision it couldn’t the first time. The original Galaxy S20 Ultra from last year promised much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;more than its parts could achieve&lt;/a&gt;. The Note 20 Ultra fixed the worst bugs but didn’t improve image quality. Thus far, the “ultra” line hasn’t been especially ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcKQIL"&gt;This year, I’m hard pressed to find major faults with the Galaxy S21’s hardware. (Software, unfortunately, is another story.) The S21 Ultra is a huge phone and an expensive one, so it won’t appeal to many — but if you’re okay with those qualities, then it is also the best Android phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTFr8V"&gt;I guess third time’s the charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mxblBx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10294570"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has Gorilla Victus glass on the back" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeqTG9TtdMdfvxPoil_iBKPmKfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248903/vpavic_210119_4377_0153.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has Gorilla Victus glass on the back&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PjLD7I"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KioJJN"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is another in a long line of truly massive Samsung phones. The screen measures 6.8 inches diagonally, which is basically tablet territory. If you are keeping score — and you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that Samsung is — the S21 Ultra’s screen spec is 0.1 inches bigger than the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. (If you account for the curved corners on the screen, the viewing area on both phones is technically smaller.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung kept the curved edges on the screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKgjuWQSuSLSAjZE6Kg-QjO2-c0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248905/vpavic_210119_4377_0166.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung kept the curved edges on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The metal rail blends into the camera bump" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivfLCxn2W8CRBF9K9adeE_6i_P0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248963/vpavic_210120_4377_0171.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The metal rail blends into the camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra vs the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The Galaxy is narrower and easier to hold" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wR15uqaCuu-Yrhm73nLaZJiCsr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248966/vpavic_210120_4377_0180.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra vs. the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The Galaxy is narrower and easier to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ub7Vke"&gt;Big Android phones are common now, though, so Samsung’s job is to not only make a powerful phone but to make one that feels well-made. Mission accomplished: the S21 Ultra looks great and feels better. It’s much more comfortable to hold than the iPhone 12 Pro Max because it is a little narrow and because it has curved edges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P3DSB"&gt;Samsung’s main design change was to blend the metal rails on the sides into the camera array on the back. It looks as good as last year’s mesa-like camera bump looked bad. I’d become a little blind to just how weird and bad most camera bumps look, and the Ultra is a reminder that they can be better designed. Though, of course, there are five big holes (four cameras, one for the laser-focusing system) which are kind of a lot to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vf1R7"&gt;There’s no getting around that this is a massive, relatively heavy phone. But Samsung also has a ton of experience making gigantic phones, and it has applied everything it has learned here. For example, contrary to the current trend, the screen is still just a little curved on the sides. I think it was the right call — it narrows the bezels on the left and right just that much more, making the phone easier to hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWC08e"&gt;As you may have heard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;Samsung is proud&lt;/a&gt; of its new, matted “phantom black” finish on the Gorilla Victus Glass on the back of the phone. It is indeed very black and it repels fingerprints well. However, I am a little worried about its durability. We have already put a tiny scratch on ours that shows through as silver simply by setting the phone down on concrete to take a photo of it. Something to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI on the Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pX_ejb1HyyfivDvmB1skcna7Ip0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248904/vpavic_210119_4377_0157.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s One UI on the Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WyL0Dn"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra specs and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PwU1iw"&gt;Funny story: usually when Samsung introduces a new flagship phone, its reps will talk my ear off about the technology and quality of its new, big screen. This year, the company simply pointed out that it supports an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz at its native 3200 x 1440 resolution and left it at that. If there had been a mic to hold on the video conference call, it could have been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gkodi8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10294644"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="voXCV1"&gt;Left unsaid because Samsung rightly knew it could be assumed: this is the best screen on a smartphone. Samsung’s default color balance choice is a little intense, but there’s a Natural option and even the ability to custom tune the Vivid option to your liking. It can reach up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness in HDR video, as well. Samsung’s “Eye Comfort” setting for turning down blue light at night is still a little ham-fisted compared to the iPhone, but that’s my only real complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxYFFS"&gt;Internally, the S21 line is the first set of mass market phones with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor. Samsung says it is utilizing the extra features in this chip to improve image processing and add the variable refresh rate (which runs from 10Hz up to 120Hz) at full resolution. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E and both flavors of 5G. The chip doesn’t benchmark as well as the iPhone’s A14 Bionic, but in single core marks it beats other Android phones with the older 865 chip handily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEnRZB"&gt;More important to me is that it feels fast. I never perceived any major lag anywhere in the phone. It also might be providing some battery efficiency improvements. For my testing, I turned on every bell and whistle: max resolution, adaptive refresh rate, high brightness, always-on screen. Even when shooting a ton of photos, 4K and 8K video, and playing games, the 5,000mAh battery lasted through the next morning consistently. With less intense usage this is easily a two-day phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX1JV"&gt;If you’re looking at this phone, you will want to step up from the default 128GB of storage. The 256GB option only costs $50 more, while 512GB (which also has 16GB of RAM instead of 12) costs $180 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5QYh7"&gt;Getting more storage on this phone is important because unlike previous S-series phones, there’s no microSD card slot on the S21 Ultra. Perhaps it was inevitable as a cost-cutting measure (along with nixing the AC adapter and MST payment tech that worked with standard credit card readers), but it’s a bummer nonetheless. A phone that encourages you to take 8K video and 108-megapixel photos needs more than 128GB of storage, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Waqhzv"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is also the first S-series phone to get support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus, though it’s sold separately and you’ll need to figure out a way to carry it (Samsung will happily sell you a bundle with a case). Later this year, Samsung will sell an S Pen Pro that adds in Bluetooth so you can use it as a remote for you phone if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaOBGT"&gt;I didn’t get the S Pen to test so I can’t speak to whether it’s any good, but I don’t have any reason to expect it would be too different from the stylus experience on the Note line of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUxWWM"&gt;But of all the specs I’ve listed — both good and disappointing — the one that had the biggest tangible effect on my experience was the new in-screen fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm. It’s both bigger and faster, and it means I can just quickly tap to unlock the phone without needing to aim that carefully. Because we unlock our phones so often, even tiny changes make a huge difference in reducing a sense of friction. It finally feels on par with rear-mounted fingerprint sensors. And of course, it works when you’re wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoWSDaQkXbibQNYSNs1u0nCpZ5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248894/vpavic_210118_4377_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTt71x"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aUvczA"&gt;It should come as no surprise that Samsung can make a big phone with good specs and a great screen. What is really supposed to make the Galaxy S21 Ultra “ultra” is the camera system — it’s the most important differentiator from the other Galaxy S phones and the place where Samsung wants to rack up the biggest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXrdLm"&gt;However, racking up megapixels and zoom lenses does not guarantee either good photos or a good experience. Look no further than the original Ultra phone, last year’s Galaxy S20 Ultra. It suffered from serious focusing issues and generally didn’t justify its higher price. The Note 20 Ultra added laser autofocus, but it still didn’t do as much as it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eOnsL"&gt;To justify its price and size, the Galaxy S21 Ultra needed to overcome years of stasis and finally bring Samsung up to par with the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGCJVH"&gt;It has. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate, but sometimes a little brighter than the scene" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRLQcWk_QOs2kA5dXrdDNe9AJY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248967/05_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210115_20210115_161844.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate but sometimes a little brighter than the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACRGWL"&gt;The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best I’ve used on any Android phone and is extremely competitive with the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And with telephoto shots, it usually wins outright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dynamic range isn’t bad" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQsYbleexawCwPGmOZuoO8SIm00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248974/32_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210115_20210115_150904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamic range isn’t bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Surprisingly, the S21 Ultra’s focal plane doesn’t seem as narrow as the S21, allow more of close subjects to stay in focus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ImqZR9Bd1SiyT7ztkDMKk4_dt60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248971/01_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210115_20210115_150250.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surprisingly, the S21 Ultra’s focal plane doesn’t seem as narrow as the S21, allowing more of close subjects to stay in focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyLohX"&gt;I came into this review with a lot of skepticism. Anytime a company promises camera improvements — especially when they are promised on the back of more megapixels and more cameras — skepticism is the right attitude. On both of those fronts, Samsung is not shying away from promises. There are five image sensors, none of them throwaways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="m4U46A"&gt;Main wide angle: 108-megapixel, OIS, f/1.8, 0.8μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6LTiHt"&gt;Ultrawide: 12-megapixel, 120-degree field of view, f/2.2, 1.4μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E20Cfr"&gt;Telephoto 1: 10-megapixel, Optical 3X, OIS, f/2.4, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dKvA2i"&gt;Telephoto 2: 10-megapixel, Optical 10X, OIS, f/4.9, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mFSNmO"&gt;Selfie camera: 40-megapixel,  80-degree field of view, f/2.2, 0.7 μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="k8JYGg"&gt;The fifth hole on the back of the phone is for the laser autofocus sensor, which was added to help with some of the focus issues on the main sensor. That main 108-megapixel sensor is also a second-generation sensor, capable of 12-bit color and featuring what Samsung says is a new “remosaicing” process for converting 108-megapixels into the default 12-megapixel images. (Getting 12-bit color requires diving into the settings and using Pro mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-i2k1W8B-bukc8aH95jdokoLNfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248987/20210116_20210116_144203.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1nvMyM"&gt;I am happy to report that nearly every problem I had with the original Galaxy S20 Ultra’s camera system has been resolved. Focusing is fast and accurate, the focal plane seems bigger, there’s no discernible shutter lag, and most of all: the pictures look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRuNy3"&gt;The main sensor also simply feels more predictable. It focuses where I tap, and parts I’d expect to get some bokeh have a nice blur. In the dark, it switches over to night mode and produces images that have significantly less noise than before (though a touch more noise than the iPhone 12 Pro Max). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qdfmu0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDc9ce"&gt;Samsung continues to tune photos differently than I prefer. Compared to the iPhone, it aims to make things a little brighter and the colors a little more intense, while Apple seems to more confidently let shadows be shadows. However, the S21 Ultra often provides better sharpness and detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RokZzh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10294723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BALGwk"&gt;Where the S21 Ultra really shines is on zooming. It has two telephoto lenses and I found myself believing in the utility of having both. Proper optical zoom at 3X makes a big difference, and Samsung uses data from multiple lenses up to 10X. Samsung still has its gimmicky “Space Zoom” that works up to 100X, but I couldn’t get anything usable beyond 30X and even then it required a lot of light to create something passable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gklCV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2rJyX"&gt;As for video, we are equally impressed. The S21 Ultra does a very good job with dynamic range and adjusting exposure on the fly as you pan the camera through a scene. Stabilization is improved, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccDt9N"&gt;Some of you might be surprised that I haven’t mentioned the Pixel 5 yet. Well, it has fallen behind. Both the S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max have switched to physically larger sensors and it has revealed the limits of computational photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cSoRMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294732"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WufM3c"&gt;As for the head-to-head with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, here’s where I have landed. If you were to take 50 photos or videos, 30 of them would be a toss-up based on your personal preference, seven or eight would be clearly better on the S21, and 12 or 13 would be better from the iPhone. They’ve very close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcGQ70"&gt;But Samsung has those telephoto options. And it also has compensated for the relative dearth of high-quality third-party Android photo apps by building in its own features. Samsung has added a “director’s mode” that lets you switch lenses on the fly while shooting video in 1080p, but I found that I preferred shooting in 4K. You can shoot in 8K and pull out a still photo, you can use “Single Take 2” to let the AI try to make a bunch of amusing photos and video effects. Samsung’s Pro modes for both photo and video are excellent. You can shoot in RAW, too, although it is a standard RAW, not an Apple-style ProRAW that has some of the benefits of HDR mixed in. (I’ll leave a full Samsung RAW vs. iPhone ProRAW competition for others.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Even in Portrait Mode, face smoothing can finally be fully disabled." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjxf2Pc6F-HxO9kAmY_1u7Xe9kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249027/31_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210118_20210118_113001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even in Portrait Mode, face smoothing can finally be fully disabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uYFCT9"&gt;Overall, there are just a thousand different ways you can work with this camera, and it can be a little overwhelming. But the good news is that the experience of just snapping a photo will yield better results than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWajv1"&gt;I’ve saved my favorite news for last: Samsung has finally, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; given us the option to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; turn off face smoothing. Behold, my wrinkles and blemishes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;No more Hamcam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ahkB0vSC7Wck4R-BKG13hja1oPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248902/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eK90LX"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Aw49cl"&gt;Here’s how Samsung’s versions of Android work: they get way way too messy and complicated, everybody complains, and eventually Samsung simplifies things. Then the cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLX0xk"&gt;Right now, we’re still heading toward the land of complication. Samsung’s One UI interface is still good for big screens, but there are just so many options in quick settings, many of which mean nothing to the average person. Unforgivably, there are still ads built into Samsung’s default apps. The biggest thing on the default home screen is a weather widget. Tap it and the next biggest thing you’re likely to see is the kind of ad that’s normally at the bottom of a crappy, overloaded website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7eHWoK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the Galaxy S21 Ultra has a downfall, it’s in how Samsung’s version of Android has become messy and displays ads in some apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CvhqQQ"&gt;Bixby, Samsung’s digital assistant, is still the default, and it’s difficult to switch away from it (you need third-party software). Surprisingly, it’s somewhat better than the last time I used it, but it’s still brittle. When I asked it to set a second alarm for 15 minutes, it consistently canceled my first alarm and set one for one second. If you set it up and set SmartThings up for your smart home and live an entirely Samsung-based life, Bixby is passable. But it’s also not necessary. The Google Assistant is still here and still better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jE6yOU"&gt;Then there’s texting. In the US, Samsung ships these phones with Samsung Messages by default, whereas everybody else in the world gets Android Messages and therefore RCS. Some US carriers support RCS on Samsung Messages, but badly. AT&amp;amp;T’s version of RCS doesn’t interoperate with other carriers yet, for example. I know Samsung isn’t to blame for RCS’s problems, but as the biggest Android seller in the US, you’d like to think the company would try to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3OPDt"&gt;But if you know your way around Android, you can make the S21 Ultra a really amazing and powerful phone. Dodge or disable all those ads and install all the non-Samsung versions of software, and it’s a powerful and sometimes elegant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8fd0L"&gt;Samsung is also better at letting customers customize its software for gigantic phone screens than Apple is. You can split-screen apps, convert apps to little pop-up floating windows, turn on a slide-over bar with access to your clipboard and calendar, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYtUfN"&gt;Getting to all that power requires wading through a lot of complexity, but I’ve always found it to be worth the effort. I just wish Samsung wouldn’t make it so difficult in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5oxfkCuVQEPp3NmhYJqj8Jl5nLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248892/vpavic_210118_4377_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t2V5QP"&gt;Usually, a review of a superpowered phone from Samsung consists of a bunch of promises and then a bunch of reality checks on those promises. With the Galaxy S21 Ultra, there are fewer caveats than before. The battery lasts beyond a full day. There’s a beautiful new design. It has the fastest speeds, best camera system, and nicest screen of any Android phone right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWSJ51"&gt;If you’re wondering how the smaller Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus compare, we’ll have follow-up reviews on those — but as a spoiler, I’ll just tell you both are much more iterative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLSVCS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best Android phone right now, if you don’t mind the size and the price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfLF1x"&gt;The biggest reality check is the software, which suffers from Samsung’s heavy-handed attempts to build its own ecosystem and further monetize an already expensive phone. I doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra will convince many iPhone users to switch — the ecosystem lock-in on iOS is too strong for that and getting the most out of Samsung’s version of Android is daunting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Wif2B"&gt;If you can navigate the software, the size, and the price tag, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best Android phone available today. I don’t know how long it will be able to hold on to that crown, but it’s got it now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YGWnV0"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is finally worthy of the name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Counter-Strike pros agree to safety protocols so they can return to LAN competition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intel Extreme Masters 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4-QVHW6W7HDUyPmqRMFAhz3Hno=/0x66:3887x2657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68699807/1204526866.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Norbert Barczyk/PressFocus/MB Media/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; players could be returning to in-person competition soon thanks to a new agreement on safety protocols. The &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; Professional Players’ Association announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CSPPAgg/status/1352257719537979396"&gt;a new series of protocols&lt;/a&gt;, created in conjunction with two major tournament organizers — the ESL and DreamHack — that could see players return to LAN tournaments early this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmiMIK"&gt;“The players are eager to play LAN events again, but only if it can be done in a safe and responsible manner based on clear protocols approved by the players,” Mads Øland, CEO of the CSPPA, said in a statement. “With this protocol now in place, we move one step closer towards returning to LAN.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OCAa0C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The players are eager to play LAN events again.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bzp4NC"&gt;According to the announcement, the protocols were created in part after observing how player unions in the NBA, NFL, and elsewhere adapted to competing amid the pandemic. The announcement includes what appears to be a fairly straightforward list of rules on testing, travel, creating controlled environments, and ensuring plans are in place in case players do test positive for COVID. The CSPPA also says that these protocols will be updated “on an ongoing basis” as the situation changes and depending on the country in which the event takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwXXsh"&gt;Last year, most esports leagues — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196237/esports-leagues-online-coronavirus-call-of-duty-overwatch-league-of-legends"&gt;including those for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — quickly shifted from in-person events to online competitions. &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; is one of the first to outline safety protocols for a return to LAN events, in large part because few other esports have player-driven associations to look out for their best interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lR7eKk"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.eslgaming.com/article/esl-x-dh-unveiling-our-direction-and-event-calendar-2021-4392"&gt;a separate announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the ESL said that it plans to host the majority of its &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; events in controlled studio environments without an audience present. “Our expected return to regular live events with audiences is slated for November, however the general guidance may change depending on how local and global guidelines change throughout the year,” the organization says. The first major ESL competition of the year will be IEM Katowice, which will be held online starting February 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9YDYX"&gt;Elsewhere in esports, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22228929/league-of-legends-championship-series-2021-season-esports-chris-greeley-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; competitions across the world are already underway&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226670/call-of-duty-cod-league-cdl-esports-2021-season-start-date-youtube"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League plans to kick off next month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230728/overwatch-league-2021-season-april-start-date-youtube-esports"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League is due to begin in April&lt;/a&gt;. Epic also recently unveiled its plans for competitive &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22239161/fortnite-esports-fncs-prize-pool-2021"&gt;including a prize pool of $20 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 65-inch P-Series Quantum X 4K TV is over $400 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio P-Series Quantum X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbQTRdbsMzM9IYzUEb8f0gPyiZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68699444/vizioqled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSKsLm"&gt;The 65-inch P-Series Quantum X from Vizio is the company’s flagship 2020 model, sitting just beneath its debut OLED in terms of picture quality. You can snag one today for $1,080 at Costco and Sam’s Club or for $1,100 from B&amp;amp;H Photo. This size usually costs $1,530, so presumably, this is Vizio’s discount for the Super Bowl on February 7th. One quick note: you don’t need a membership at Costco to get this deal, but you’ll be charged a 5 percent non-member surcharge that’ll add about $50 to the total, whereas Sam’s Club requires a membership. B&amp;amp;H Photo has no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggf856"&gt;Getting into the specs, this LED panel can deliver near-OLED levels of contrast and good color and lighting accuracy. It has support for HDR10, Dolby Vision, and HLG HDR, and its 384 local dimming zones mean you likely won’t notice areas of the screen that look splotchy with light during any scene. And impressively, it can go up to 3,000 nits of brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFZPiG"&gt;The P-Series Quantum X is also compatible with AirPlay and can serve as a Chromecast. Notably, gamers should get a lot of value out of this model since it has HDMI 2.1 ports that allow for 4K resolution while pushing up to 120Hz if your console or PC can reach those heights. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224956/vizio-firmware-update-oled-p-series-quantum-x-xbox-series-x-ps5-pc-nvidia-variable-refresh-rate-4k"&gt;This model was recently updated with better support for high-end gaming gear&lt;/a&gt;, including PCs with Nvidia GPUs, the PS5, and the Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iCXGG9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295302"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wfWd4V"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro review|75664" data-volume-uuid="0d2a0cdfb" data-volume-id="75664" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-867" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfbhTi"&gt;If you have an 11-inch iPad Pro or the latest iPad Air (also released in 2020, with USB-C charging), you might be interested in this $100-off deal on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; that will grant your tablet its very own dedicated keyboard and trackpad. It essentially provides a laptop-like experience, in case you’re trying to get more done and don’t want to lug around too many devices. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Magic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2nd-generation%2F984505060&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is hosting this deal&lt;/a&gt;, and as mentioned, it’s $100 off the usual price. That’s a steep, rare discount, and I’m not sure how long it will last.&lt;/p&gt;
