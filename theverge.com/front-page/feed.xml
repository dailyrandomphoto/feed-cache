    <title>V-Moda BoomPro X review: turn your favorite headphones into the perfect gaming or Zoom headset</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An easy way to upgrade your headphone microphone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4dp9Sl"&gt;There’s something to be said for cheap, simple gadgets. The BoomPro is a smart idea that’s executed almost perfectly. With a single cable, you get a microphone (with a flexible arm for easy repositioning), volume controls, and a mute switch. It can substitute for the 3.5mm audio cable that you’d normally plug into your favorite wireless headphones, immediately transforming them into a much better communication tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4eJdU"&gt;For years now, I’ve been using V-Moda’s BoomPro microphone to chat with people while gaming. During the pandemic, I’ve also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication/dp/B00BJ17WKK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regularly used the $35 accessory&lt;/a&gt; to improve the audio quality on my end of conference calls — when I don’t want to bother with my desk-mounted Rode microphone, that is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj4Siy"&gt;This week, V-Moda announced a new evolution of that idea: &lt;a href="https://www.v-moda.com/us/en/products/boom-pro-x"&gt;the $45 BoomPro X&lt;/a&gt; has a tweaked design, revamped mic, and more streamlined controls. But otherwise it sticks largely to the same formula. You can plug it in when you’re sitting down for some multiplayer or joining a Zoom meeting, and then just detach the cable once you’re done and use your headphones like normal. Antlion’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YN25KWN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ModMic products are similar in concept&lt;/a&gt;, but they use a magnetic attachment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdYomO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10722580"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OE5mLf"&gt;The best aspect of the BoomPro X is its versatility. You can instantly convert any headphones you already own into a gaming or conference call headset. Sure, V-Moda would love for you to use it with the company’s own headphones — but it’ll work equally well with other pairs like Sony’s WH-1000XM4 or Microsoft’s Surface Headphones 2. As long as you’ve got headphones with a detachable 3.5mm cable, you’re all set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMi6Dp"&gt;Some headsets (like those from Bose) use a smaller 2.5mm jack, but even then, you can use a 2.5mm-to-3.5mm adapter to get the BoomPro X working. USB-C adapters work fine too. In many cases, using the headphones you already love will also give you better sound quality than you’d get buying a single-purpose gaming headset. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NxcSmq3cIfEy133T7ZlwtMWEenQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812067/DSCF4717_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoomPro X can be plugged into any set of wireless headphones that accepts a 3.5mm cable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CSGS5B"&gt;Compared to the original BoomPro, V-Moda has made quite a few changes. The most significant difference is the type of microphone being used: to help reduce background noise, it’s now a cardioid unidirectional mic that’s designed to only pick up sound coming from wherever it’s pointed. The older BoomPro used an omnidirectional mic, which allowed more ambient sound to come through. But now your voice should be better isolated when on work calls or in the middle of a hectic &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; match. I’ve regularly got either an air conditioner running or a fan blasting to combat the New York summer heat, and they’re not nearly as audible in my recordings with the new mic so far. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7G_qS9WKmfFZ79Aj7ZXzXFMS5ic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812065/DSCF4705_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The microphone is now unidirectional and better at isolating your voice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jrq2U7"&gt;In terms of mic audio quality, the BoomPro X certainly isn’t going to approach a proper podcasting setup or professional microphone. It seems to favor lower frequencies and lacks some crispness. But it’s definitely &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt;, and you’ll get far better results than you normally would through the built-in mics on wireless headphones. The boom arm makes all the difference for clarity, and you don’t have to worry about nearby noise that your laptop’s mics would pick up during a work meeting. In my tests on both PS5 and Xbox Series X, everyone said my voice came through loud and clear without any annoying audio hiss or other distractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rk5zvM"&gt;The onboard controls have also been redesigned and downsized. They now look much closer to the inline controls on many headphone cables, and the housing is much thinner and lighter. The old controls were so large that V-Moda included a non-removable clip for attaching the plastic to your clothes, but that’s gone — and so is the occasional pull/drag you’d feel from the previous, heavier controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PLZG73yaGRU7TkDDVMJiHfKq-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812068/DSCF4722_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Moda shrank down the controls, but that meant getting rid of the volume dial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vX9CUY"&gt;But the controls themselves have also changed. Instead of a dial for adjusting headphone volume, V-Moda switched to a slider. It does the job, but something about the dial felt more natural to me. On the other side is a mute switch, which works exactly as you’d expect. Since both of the controls now use similar slider buttons, it’s hard to distinguish between them by feel, which is another reason I preferred the old volume knob. But I don’t think V-Moda had much of a choice considering how much smaller the new controls are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYfmHW"&gt;The BoomPro X cable is shorter than the original, but in the box you get an extension cable if you need more length between your device and the headphones. (Both the standard cable and extension are each 1 meter in length.) I like that, since you don’t always want a ton of extra cord if you’re plugging into a game controller or nearby laptop. There’s also a Y-adapter included. New for the BoomPro X, V-Moda also throws in five different tiny microphone covers in different colors: this company is &lt;a href="https://www.v-moda.com/us/en/customization"&gt;known for its customization and personalized ear cup shields&lt;/a&gt;, but the mic covers are way more subtle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GYDOw-OJXN5dQ-dFxnVNfK6zgvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812069/DSCF4724_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different mic cover colors are included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A9qUzJ"&gt;I’ve liked the BoomPro enough to carry it in my headphones case for a long time, and I’m even happier with the BoomPro X thanks to the improved, unidirectional mic. That’s easily worth the $10 extra, and in return I get a simple gadget that leaves me sounding better when I’m gaming or working from home — all with the headphones I’d be wearing anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 model weighs less because it has a smaller heatsink</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xC7ly7_3uC_kYtAc4zAHXSuKrPc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69789710/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vhTqE"&gt;A new PS5 model started appearing in Australia, Japan, and parts of the US earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637524/sony-new-ps5-model-revision-lighter-screwdriver-stand-base-features"&gt;with a new stand design&lt;/a&gt; and a mysterious reduction in weight. Thanks to a teardown video from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taKKVBVoKhg"&gt;YouTuber Austin Evans&lt;/a&gt;, the mystery has now been solved: Sony has changed the heatsink that helps cool the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfW9xf"&gt;The new heatsink is significantly smaller than the original, and makes up for the entire weight reduction of 300 grams (0.6 pounds), according to Evans. It’s not clear why Sony has swapped out the heatsink so early on in the PS5’s lifecycle, but Evans does note that his particular unit ran hotter as a result — with rear exhaust temperatures around 3 to 5 degrees higher. That could be down to manufacturing variance, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XsEagxUKr9LL8-Xt2lGzot-MdE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22812813/newps5heatsink.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Austin Evans (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taKKVBVoKhg" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old PS5 heat sink (left) vs. new PS5 heat sink (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w10wIf"&gt;Sony uses this heatsink to cool the PS5, and the console has a heat pipe with a shape and airflow that’s designed to create the same level of performance as a vapor chamber. The heatsink, hard copper plate, and aluminum dissipation fins all take up a significant amount of space inside the PS5, and contribute greatly to its overall size. It’s interesting to see Sony reduce the size of this part, and I’m hoping this could be the first sign of the company working towards a smaller PS5 model. The PS5 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438782/sony-ps5-size-specs-dimensions-console-huge-large-big"&gt;biggest game console in modern history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5wuqe"&gt;Evans does conclude that the changes make the PS5 worse though, due to the extra heat he recorded. That could well make the launch PS5s more desirable, if it’s something we see replicated elsewhere. “I don’t think there’s any argument that this is a worse console, at least for thermals and for cooling,” says Evans. “As far as I’m concerned I’d rather have a launch PS5.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hgt6Wn"&gt;The revision comes just as Sony reveals it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit"&gt;no longer selling the $499 version&lt;/a&gt; of the PS5 at a loss, and after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137392/sony-ps5-price-cost-of-manufacture-psvr-2-report"&gt;reports last year suggested&lt;/a&gt; Sony was battling to keep the PS5 costs down thanks in part to its expensive cooling solution. Evans has only opened up a Digital Edition version of the PS5, so we don’t know for sure whether Sony has also changed the cooling unit on the model with a disc drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile CEO calls latest data breach ‘humbling,’ claims it’s committed to security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile Kicks Off $3 Billion Bond Sale To Buy 5G Spectrum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2V0H5We63VdhnL-hKeUivSOYQgw=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788941/1231755320.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2NwJ4"&gt;A recent T-Mobile data breach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;coughed up the information of more than 50 million people&lt;/a&gt;, including some who aren’t current customers or never were. The 21-year-old hacker who says they’re responsible for the attack already did &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calling its security “awful,” and now CEO Mike Sievert is speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zn26vr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is T-Mobile’s fifth incident in four years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17ezIQ"&gt;Sievert says he’s taking a moment to update us now that the breach is contained and the investigation is “substantially complete.” “Keeping our customers’ data safe is a responsibility we take incredibly seriously and preventing this type of event from happening has always been a top priority of ours,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fcyberattack-against-tmobile-and-our-customers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBxgkw"&gt;It’s true that these attacks happen to many companies, but it’s hard to take the statement as sincere when T-Mobile has had at least five breaches since 2018. That includes this one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;two in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, plus one each for 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAdfgU"&gt;To do something about it, T-Mobile is partnering with cybersecurity firm Mandiant and consultants at KPMG to tighten things up. Will that put an end to this ridiculous streak of insecurity? No one can know, but that’s more than the “sorry for any inconvenience” notes released &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378821&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcustomers%2F6305378822&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646439%2Ft-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the past breaches, and of course, all the subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637797/tmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans"&gt;got a free year of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Too bad it’s only happening after a hacker made off with enough IMEI/IMSI, driver’s license, and social security data to spend the next few years stealing identities and phone numbers at will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes’ defense likely includes testimony accusing her ex-partner of abuse</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8IvmAU"&gt;With just a few days left until Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes faces criminal fraud charges at trial, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21050910-elizabth-holmes-motion"&gt;newly unsealed court documents&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/837408a5-d9ad-4620-bba3-0cc422fc978b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) reveal evidence that her lawyers may cite in her defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBUXve"&gt;If you don’t remember the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11458798/theranos-blood-tests-elizabeth-holmes-ceo-news-controversy"&gt;details from the scandal&lt;/a&gt; as described in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com%2Fbooks%2F549478%2Fbad-blood-by-john-carreyrou%2F9781524731656%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22646130%2Ftheranos-elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, documentary, and more than one podcast series, Theranos told investors it developed revolutionary blood test technology capable of amazing results based on just a few small drops. Theranos had been valued at as much as $9 billion before &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; exposed its inaccurate results and use of modified machines by other companies to perform crucial testing instead of its own Edison device. The company folded in 2016, and federal prosecutors &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/cases-of-interest/usa-v-holmes-et-al/USA-v.-Holmes-18-CR-00258-Dkt-469-Third-Sup-Indictment.pdf"&gt;charged Holmes and Balwani&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) two years later for wire fraud, listing investors and patients as victims of their deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RAckz7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elizabeth Holmes’ legal team said she is ‘highly likely’ to testify&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRXyFZ"&gt;That brings us to 2019 and 2020 when lawyers filed these documents in an eventually successful attempt to sever the two as defendants. They are public now &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/cases-of-interest/usa-v-holmes-et-al/USA-v.-Holmes-18-cr-00258-EJD-Dkt-881-Dow-Jones-Mtn-to-Intervene-and-Unseal.pdf"&gt;due to a challenge&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phwQUm"&gt; Holmes’ lawyers argued that for over a decade, she and Balwani — who was 20 years older and met Holmes when she was an 18-year-old Stanford student — had an abusive relationship that included “monitoring her calls, text messages, and emails; physical violence, such as throwing hard, sharp objects at her, restricting her sleep, monitoring her movements; and insisting that any success she achieved was because of him,” as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/28/elizabeth-holmes-plans-to-claim-at-trial-that-ex-boyfriend-and-theranos-business-partner-abused-her.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3v7ROj"&gt;While it’s not certain what strategy will be used in Holmes’ defense, the Wall Street Journal notes that her lawyers wrote it’s “highly likely Holmes would testify” about Balwani’s abusive behavior. Balwani’s lawyers also filed seeking separate trials, denying those claims of abusive behavior and said her allegations would prejudice potential jurors. According to his lawyer Jeffrey Coopersmith, “Ms. Holmes’ allegations are deeply offensive to Mr. Balwani, devastating personally to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luOF8T"&gt;The documents submitted by Holmes’ lawyers show they’ve collected testimony from experts that could be used in a mental-health defense, arguing that she suffers from PTSD, intimate-partner abuse syndrome, and depression due to Balwani and another incident. According to the filings revealed by the Wall Street Journal, they could argue that “a result of her deference to Mr. Balwani, she believed that various representations were true.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is threatening to withhold Windows 11 updates if your CPU is old</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DG34fHd3L9z2hxZWWJ9-QaJiW64=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788173/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YqpVl9"&gt;Yesterday, we wrote how Microsoft’s Windows 11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes"&gt;won’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; leave millions of PCs behind&lt;/a&gt; — the company told us it won’t actually block you from installing Windows 11 on a PC with an older CPU, so long as you download and manually install an ISO file all by yourself. But it turns out even that technicality has a technicality. Microsoft is now threatening to withhold Windows Updates from your copy of Windows 11 — potentially even security updates — if you take that route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWELFv"&gt;We’re not sure why the company didn’t mention it in our original briefing, but Microsoft has since told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that unsupported PCs won’t be entitled to receive Windows Updates, and that even security and driver updates may be withheld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RYnKE5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CYA or genuine threat?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0iOD9H"&gt;It’s quite possible this is just a cover-your-ass measure on Microsoft’s part. It’s hard to imagine that Microsoft wouldn’t issue critical security patches, when we’ve often seen the company extend support and offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21082228/microsoft-windows-7-black-wallpaper-fix-update-support-patch"&gt;the occasional free patch&lt;/a&gt; even after it’s shelved an operating system for good. If I were in Microsoft’s shoes, I might just want to discourage people from thinking I was offering a warranty and technical support for every possible PC configuration under the sun to avoid potential legal headaches down the road. Better to underpromise and overdeliver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gqppk5"&gt;But it’s also possible Microsoft genuinely does mean to withhold patches at some point in the future — potentially even at launch. Microsoft declined to clarify things further at this time, which suggests the company’s perfectly happy for us to assume this is a genuine threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqiZ5i"&gt;It’s not just security updates at stake, by the way: If you’re unwilling or unable to replace your older-than-Intel 8th-Gen-CPU, Windows 11 could theoretically be an operating system where you go back to the days of manually downloading driver updates for all your hardware, something I haven’t needed to think about for years. Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/windows-10-day-one-1719864054"&gt;wowed me from day one&lt;/a&gt; by seamlessly working with my aging laptop, so it’d suck if that’s not the case anymore. (Admittedly, the generic drivers that ship with Windows are often good enough.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRokl1"&gt;Feature updates are probably less of a big deal: if you’re the kind of person who would install a Windows 11 ISO on your computer to begin with, you can probably download a newer ISO the next time there’s a major Windows update that you want, and do an in-place-install. I just reformatted my machine with the Windows 10 2H21 ISO, and I barely had any patching to do afterwards. But I suppose Microsoft could change its mind about system requirements for future ISOs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkbyYZ"&gt;Why leave us in the dark? My best guess is the one I offered yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643275/windows-11-upgrade-system-requirements-pc-health-check"&gt;when I wrote how “The Windows 11 upgrade situation just got less and more confusing”&lt;/a&gt;: the company seemingly wants to push Windows users to buy a new PC, whether they need one or not. Yesterday, the company told us about a loophole that could placate some of the company's vocal power users who don’t want to give up their old hardware. But if that loophole gets in the way of Microsoft’s plans, the company is reserving the right to make it far less attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google allegedly offered Netflix a break on the usual Play Store commission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_MURAXxjAl9CjKO5fMO7Qp5SFI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69788152/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nXg4ra"&gt;An antitrust lawsuit filed against Google and its Play Store by several state attorneys general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;echoed the Epic vs. Apple battle&lt;/a&gt;, and a new document highlights how and why Google’s app store is so similar. &lt;em&gt;MLex&lt;/em&gt; senior correspondent Michael Acton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398632134037505"&gt;points out the new complaint&lt;/a&gt;, which arrived Friday night from lawyers &lt;a href="https://kaplanfox.com/news/1428-google.html"&gt;appointed to represent consumers&lt;/a&gt; (that’s us) in a potential class-action lawsuit that joins the states and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; in accusing Google of abusing its monopoly power and of anti-competitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Similarly, Netflix, Spotify, and Tinder, some of the nation’s largest and most popular subscription services, have repeatedly sought to bypass Google Play Billing. In particular, Netflix wanted an alternative payments system. Apparently in an effort to ameliorate this displeasure, Google offered to take a significantly reduced revenue share percentage to Netflix. Not all developers, however, have met with Netflix’s success, even though many have sought to use their own payment systems.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDZZ58EPymQbhEBf50byIn2h5nI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22811596/google_netflix_feesa.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MLex, CONSOLIDATED FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, CASE NO. 3:20-CV-05761-JD - 42&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jkqa9z"&gt;Perhaps most telling is a mention that popular subscription services like Spotify, Netflix, and Tinder have tried to find ways around Google Play Billing and that 30 percent cut. This is no secret, as the direct collection of credit card info by Netflix and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/technology/google-play-store-30-percent.html"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; resulted in Google posting a “&lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/09/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html"&gt;clarification&lt;/a&gt;” explaining that Play Store apps must use Google’s billing system and giving them a year to change. In this filing, the lawyers accuse Google of offering Netflix a “significantly reduced revenue share” with the apparent intention of squashing its desire to use an alternative payments system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLEUqN"&gt;While we haven’t seen the details or timing of this supposed pitch, it’s a direct reflection of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;things we learned in the Epic vs. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt;, where Apple emails show it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;offered a series of sweeteners to keep Netflix on its in-app purchase system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kYgI66"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store is too big to change","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22645070/apple-app-store-policies-purchases-cut-fees-change-class-action"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RLbdsx"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokeswoman says, “All developers are subject to the same policies as all other developers, including the payments policy.  We’ve long had &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/continuing-to-boost-developer-success.html"&gt;programs&lt;/a&gt; in place that support developers with enhanced resources and investments. These programs are a sign of healthy competition between operating systems and app stores and benefit developers.” Whether that’s a sign of healthy competition is arguable, as Google’s efforts largely match those from Apple, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502152/google-play-store-android-apple-app-store-subscription-revenue-cut"&gt;cutting the commission on subscriptions by half after a year&lt;/a&gt;. However, it does go further in offering&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt; a 15 percent cut to developers on their first $1 million in revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2U2qo"&gt;Google’s standard 30 percent commission is still a major target, as the suit cites internal Google figures suggesting the break-even level for revenue sharing is actually about six percent. The complaint quotes Google internal communications that admit setting the “arbitrary fee” at 30 percent has “[n]o rationale, other than copying Apple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHlqsl"&gt;And as far as competition, the lawyers cite Google estimates that say even a major player like Samsung could only manage $100 million in revenue for 2019, while the Play Store raked in around $4 billion just from Samsung phones. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-play-app-store-revenue-reached-112-bln-2019-lawsuit-says-2021-08-28/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that an unsealed filing in the state AGs antitrust case against Google reveals the Play Store brought in $11.2 billion in total in 2019, with $8.5 billion in gross profit and $7 billion in operating income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SDQZg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3 - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Google?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Google&lt;/a&gt; calculated could break even with a 6 percent commission fee on Play Store - compared to 30 percent&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Acton (@MActon93) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398632134037505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FSjl9s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/"&gt;Google’s response to the state AGs in June&lt;/a&gt; said the Play Store “provides more openness and choice than others,” and that on Android, “you can choose to download the app from a rival app store or directly from a developer’s website.” However, this filing pokes holes in that argument as well, pointing out that Google’s OEM agreements with phone manufacturers interfere with making other app stores as easy to access as the Play Store, which they must include on a device’s home screen to pre-load Google apps like Gmail and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For apps distributed through the Google Play Store, Google in its DDA with app developers imposes multiple anticompetitive restrictions. First, it prohibits developers from distributing to their existing customers outside of Google Play, either by (1) using customer information to contact them directly or (2) steering those customers within the app to another store or to the developers’ own website." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TZrvNyjU0HY25-TBrr1moBLJFTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22811593/google_dda.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="stQ6rl"&gt;In a timely call-out, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html"&gt;it cites the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement&lt;/a&gt; that forbids developers from using information about customers that they get from the Play Store, like email addresses, to reach them directly. You can read the relevant section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LCP47a"&gt;4.9 You will not engage in any activity with Google Play, including making Your Products available via Google Play, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the devices, servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any Authorized Provider. You may not use user information obtained via Google Play to sell or distribute Products outside of Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iY2caL"&gt;That makes it “impossible for developers to directly reach customers to offer alternatives to Google Play Store,” according to the suit. Allowing developers to use information from the App Store to contact customers with emails including information about alternative payment options is one of the small concessions Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;made in its proposed class action settlement earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. However, companies like Spotify and Epic say that doesn’t go nearly far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe charger and the latest GoPro highlight this weekend’s best deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3CK8E198tvDEWPA5BaR5GVKhuJ4=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69787554/akrales_201018_4238_0464.0.12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MagSafe makes for a convenient charger around the house&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdpAZu"&gt;The ecosystem of MagSafe chargers for the iPhone 12 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;might not be very expansive&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to go wrong with Apple’s base magnetic wireless charger — especially when it’s discounted to $30 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The magnetic puck can provide the iPhone 12 Mini with up to 12 watts of power or the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro with up to 15 watts, so long as you use a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt;. It can also top off other iPhones that support wireless charging without magnets. In fact, it can power up any device that supports Qi charging, including AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D0rzh1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10676303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GEdaz"&gt;It’s not too late to seek out some fun and adventure before the summer winds down, and this GoPro deal could help you document it. The GoPro Hero 9 Black is a rugged little action cam capable of capturing 5K video and 23.6-megapixel photos. It’s versatile enough to record underwater footage or capture a timelapse sequence, and portable enough to be worn or placed into any situation for a unique perspective. The GoPro Hero 9 Black is on sale from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DK5ZH44?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — its best price ever — saving you $50 and (hopefully) helping motivate you to live a more exciting life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eTOlFB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7QUlF5"&gt;School is about to be in full swing, and if you’re looking to pick up one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops available&lt;/a&gt;, the M1-equipped MacBook Air should be at the top of your list. Apple’s new chip makes for lightning-fast performance, which is further buoyed by great battery life, a revised scissor-switch keyboard, and the ability to run iPhone and iPad apps natively. The only thing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559478/apple-m1-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-design-same-chip-transition-hardware"&gt;hasn’t really changed&lt;/a&gt; since its Intel-based predecessor is the laptop’s iconic, wedge-shaped design, which, given the excellent build quality, isn’t necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1F4X"&gt;Although the 2020 MacBook Air recently dropped to as low as $850, it’s back up to its typical sale price of $899 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604825-REG%2Fapple_mgn63ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F28%2F22644815%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-gopro-hero-9-black-action-cam-m1-macbook-air-xbox-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, now its second-best price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="88Zl6D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="asazSb"&gt;If there ever was an Xbox controller that took a cue from the abstract expressionist movement of the late 1940s, the &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; Limited Edition Xbox Wireless Controller would be it. The forthcoming Xbox Series X / S controller — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639740/xbox-series-x-forza-horizon-5-colorful-translucent-controller"&gt;revealed during the Gamescom&lt;/a&gt; 2021 Xbox stream — is more vibrant than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607786/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-aqua-shift-special-edition-blue-rubber-side-grips"&gt;recently-announced Aqua Shift controller&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox Series X / S, with a translucent-yellow build, splashes of color, and joysticks designed to match the aesthetic. It also comes with some exclusive &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;DLC, though it won’t arrive until the game launches on November 9th. Normally $75, you can &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-Forza-Horizon-5-Limited-Edition-for-Xbox-Series-X-S-Xbox-One-and-Windows-10-PCs%2F168090079" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder now for $6 off at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store is too big to change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufI18ykJAB9-tAqCIK2pLV2KwXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69787458/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVSgM1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;Apple made waves this week&lt;/a&gt; by announcing a $100 million settlement with small app developers who sued the company. But despite the changes announced yesterday, nothing is really changing for developers — the App Store is too big and too reliant on in-app purchase fees for that to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuyIpb"&gt;Apple’s settlement &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22645070%2Fapple-app-store-policies-purchases-cut-fees-change-class-action" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;includes several new policies&lt;/a&gt; that it says “clarif[y]” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;the App Store’s rules&lt;/a&gt;. Developers can now contact customers about alternative payment methods using data collected from their app (so long as the notification itself is done outside their apps), which they had previously been barred from doing. Apple promises to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces Apple’s revenue cut down to 15 percent for developers who make less than $1 million a year, in its current state for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PQim7S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s $100 million settlement agreement changes a key App Store rule for developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u3QmCZ"&gt;The same goes for organizing its search results by “objective characteristics” like downloads, star ratings, and text relevance. Developers can set new price points for apps, and Apple promises to give them more information about how appeals work. It also plans to publish an annual transparency report about the App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSGOpw"&gt;But none of this is likely to make much of a difference in the long run to how the App Store actually works, or how the developers who make most of its money work with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XMtMd"&gt;This settlement gives concessions to small businesses on the App Store, but a handful of huge companies make most of the money on the App Store itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8F86jh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An estimated 98 percent of App Store developers are considered “small businesses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ud2urf"&gt;While Apple itself didn’t give any numbers on how many of its developers fall into the “small app” category of making less than $1 million, a SensorTower report from late last year claimed that roughly 98 percent of all App Store developers qualify for the program. That report also noted that those developers — which Apple calls the “vast majority” of iOS app developers — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;only account for 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the App Store’s total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slglWg"&gt;The economics of the App Store in 2021 are rules set by one multitrillion-dollar company to capture revenue from in-app transactions on the 2 percent of developers that account for 95 percent of commerce on Apple’s platforms. And all these rules and regulations and settlements and clarifications are to mollify the vast majority of developers who are effectively just bystanders caught in that larger crossfire. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJRKx8TEuwF2n_56VKmkMbwIgzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689244/cgartenberg_210629_4653_001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gw1be"&gt;So what does Apple care if it has to give up $100 million here (the payout from its latest class action suit) or $59 million there (the estimated yearly cost to Apple of the Small App Business program)? As long as it’s able to defend the 30 percent cut of purchases that flow through its store from the bigger developers and apps, it can give whatever concessions it needs to on things like search rankings or new price points for apps to settle class action suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BSTlV"&gt;Apple’s biggest change, the option to discuss alternate payment methods, also has a hidden edge. Developers are now allowed to discuss alternative payment methods for subscriptions or services outside of their app using contact information obtained in the app — for example, they can now offer a form to submit an email address to sign up for deals to be sent to your inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRvlLw"&gt;But if you want to actually sell something &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;your app, you still have to use Apple’s payment methods (and pay Apple’s cut), something that’s still a major point of contention for a lot of developers. And as last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;dramatic fight between Apple and Hey&lt;/a&gt; showed, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;not always easy to bypass Apple’s payments&lt;/a&gt; even if you are willing to jump through Apple’s hoops and only sign up users outside the app, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBkyOQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store runs on subscription and in-app purchases from a relatively small number of developers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTPQC5"&gt;The simple fact is that the App Store is a massive business for Apple at this point, and in 2021, the business of the App Store &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases and subscriptions. Consider the top-grossing apps offered on Apple’s store. &lt;a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/apps/ios/top/"&gt;App Annie’s list&lt;/a&gt; of 50 top grossing is absent any paid apps; &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/all-categories?date=2021-08-27"&gt;SensorTower’s list of 200&lt;/a&gt; includes just one, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; (at 109th place as of publication time, and as a game that notably also features in-app purchases). The biggest moneymakers on the platform — and therefore, the biggest moneymakers for Apple — are all free-to-play games, streaming services, and subscription-based apps that rely on customers buying and subscribing through Apple’s payments processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DWeDc"&gt;With the amount of money at stake here, Apple was never going to make it possible (or even easier) for developers to alert users to alternative payment methods within their apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYBcNg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;App Store was estimated&lt;/a&gt; to bring around $64 billion in sales in 2020. Factoring in the company’s 30 percent cut, that works out to roughly $19 billion in revenue for Apple. Though the actual number is likely slightly smaller, given that Apple offers reduced 15 percent cuts for things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;for subscriptions after a year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvPAHh"&gt;But at the end of the day, Apple was never going to budge. The App Store is too big and too important to the company, and the way the App Store works in 2021 means that — unless a court decides otherwise, as Epic, Spotify, and others are actively trying to do — nothing will really change for the core parts of the app economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkmXD1"&gt;And that, of course, is something that Apple’s clarifications won’t interfere with at all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your iPhone 12’s earpiece failed, Apple might fix it for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hA8Nb3FZLVe0e23sXqlok6_Yg5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69786179/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oX86cP"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;announced a service program&lt;/a&gt; to fix failing receivers on iPhone 12 and 12 Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apple-launches-new-iphone-12-service-program-for-no-sound-issues/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company says that non-Mini or Max phones made between October 2020 and April 2021 may have an issue where no sound comes out of the earpiece when making or receiving calls, and that it’ll fix the issue for free as part of the new program. According to Apple, the problem is caused by a component in the receiver module failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o14osJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;Apple’s page&lt;/a&gt; says that only a “very small percentage” of devices may be affected. While it can be hard to tell what Apple means by “small percentage” (it &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks"&gt;infamously used the phrase&lt;/a&gt; when describing the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;butterfly keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that experienced issues), it doesn’t appear that the earpiece issue is widespread — searching for reports of failing receivers on Reddit or Twitter only turned up a few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9OQk3M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The issue covered doesn’t seem widespread&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAPIFk"&gt;Still, for those with these phones, it’s nice to know that if your earpiece starts to go you’ll have some recourse. While all iPhone 12s are still under Apple’s one year warranty, the service program covers devices for two years after purchase, giving your earpiece an extra year of coverage. There is one thing to note if you’ve got this problem and are looking to send your phone in, though: Apple says that if your screen is cracked, it’ll have to be fixed before it’ll carry out the receiver repair. While the earpiece fix won’t cost you anything, the screen damage repair could, so just be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBPwF3"&gt;Apple also says that phones “will be examined prior to any service” to make sure they’re eligible for the program. This likely means that you won’t be getting a free fix if you’re like me and broke your phone’s receiver by accidentally spilling boiling hot pickling liquid into it. C’est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus orders new series Players from American Vandal creators  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57Zg2qatvSEm-uieOMnRCQwAt4o=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785956/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pkZ2j"&gt;Paramount Plus has ordered a new documentary-style comedic series titled &lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt; that will delve into a fictional professional League of Legends esports team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrvIMu"&gt;The series is co-created and executive produced by Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, the comedic minds behind Netflix’s critical breakout&lt;em&gt; American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;, which memorably gave us a pair of riveting — albeit disturbed — mysteries about fictional crimes involving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339154/american-vandal-netflix-mockumentary-making-a-murderer-instagram-snapchat-documentary"&gt;dick vandalism&lt;/a&gt; and the mastermind behind an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763640/american-vandal-season-2-jokes-comedy-netflix"&gt;explosive diarrhea incident&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i0mHf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt;, also a mockumentary, will follow an esports team gunning for a championship after years of misfortune. The series will involve a clash of egos between a 17-year-old rookie, the team’s “prodigy,” and a veteran 27-year-old. What could &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; go wrong? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pCHy7X"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwrr6aIWeus?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZzqXV"&gt;Yacenda, who directed FXX comedy series &lt;em&gt;Dave&lt;/em&gt;, will direct &lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt;. The series is being produced by CBS Studios in partnership with Funny Or Die, which was attached to Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;. Paramount Plus offered sparse detail about the series beyond stating Players “will explore the world of esports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ymrato"&gt;But given that &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;’s two-series run delivered frankly inspired plotlines about penis graffiti and a Turd Burglar — somehow managing to set a new bar for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339154/american-vandal-netflix-mockumentary-making-a-murderer-instagram-snapchat-documentary"&gt;future of documentary storytelling&lt;/a&gt; in the process — we’re in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZksHbZ"&gt;Paramount Plus (formerly CBS All Access) has only had a handful of originals that drummed up any significant fanfare. But given the cultural impact of &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt; — which managed to make us seriously ask ourselves, “Who dick the dicks?” — this series has the potential to be one of the service’s biggest comedy debuts since it launched.&lt;/p&gt;
