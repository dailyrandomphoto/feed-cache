    <title>Microsoft is holding an Xbox and Bethesda showcase on June 13th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S6nO3f"&gt;Microsoft’s big E3 event to showcase upcoming Xbox and Bethesda games will kick off on Sunday, June 13th at 1PM ET. It will be a 90-minute show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NxMId"&gt;“The show will be focused on games from Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and many game creators from our partners around the world,” Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox games marketing, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/05/26/join-us-for-the-xbox-and-bethesda-games-showcase/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6pFlt9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re thrilled to announce the Xbox &amp;amp; Bethesda Games Showcase will be Sunday, June 13. Tune-in details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/DIsA6QQZzP"&gt;https://t.co/DIsA6QQZzP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxBethesda?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxBethesda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1397628674757652485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="onU3XU"&gt;Microsoft completed its huge acquisition of ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, so this event will be the first opportunity to see what the two companies have been cooking up together. The acquisition doesn’t mean that all Bethesda games are now Xbox exclusives — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442372/deathloop-preview-arkane-studios-ps5"&gt;upcoming &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from Bethesda-owned Arkane Studios, is debuting on PS5 and PC — but Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has already said that “some new titles in the future” will only be coming to Xbox and the company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He6KfM"&gt;There are a lot of potential titles that could be on display during the June showcase. We could get our next look at &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; following its &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/craig-the-halo-infinite-brute"&gt;rough showing last July&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;subsequent delay to this year&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164440/halo-infinite-launch-date-fall-2021"&gt;It’s set to launch in the fall&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt; seems tantalizingly close to release, especially after a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeluwz3g64A"&gt;recent update video posted by developer Double Fine&lt;/a&gt;, so we might get some news about the long-in-the-works sequel. Microsoft announced upcoming new titles in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335535/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-windows-10-trailer-game-pass-rpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21332876/forza-motorsport-xbox-series-x-trailer-4k-60fps-ray-tracing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series last year, so we may hear more about those games and other titles revealed at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21331849/xbox-series-x-games-event-trailers-gameplay-announcements-microsoft"&gt;last summer’s Xbox showcase&lt;/a&gt;. And from Bethesda, fingers crossed we’ll finally learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447792/bethesda-starfield-new-series-announced-e3-2018"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226966/bethesda-indiana-jones-game-machinegames"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost Mobile is offering customers an Android 11 phone for $35</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7a1_2zLWm3xpWkXsv4WjEKXFW2s=/0x1:2353x1570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346801/WikoRide3_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wiko Ride 3 offers a 6.09-inch display and Android 11 out of the box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wiko Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5umbsn"&gt;With T-Mobile’s older CDMA network shutdown looming and no sign of a delay in sight, Boost Mobile customers looking for a new 4G phone just got a very affordable new option: the Wiko Ride 3. It’s currently marked down to $34.99 from a full retail price of $99.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OATL1x"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/boost-mobile-wiko-ride-3-affordable-android-11-phone-specs-features-price_id132374"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that promotional pricing somewhat unusually applies to existing customers rather than new ones. It’s unusual but not unexpected: the CDMA network shutdown could leave many Boost customers in need of a new phone. These customers might also start shopping around for a new carrier, so Boost has some extra incentive to offer current customers a good deal. Meanwhile, anyone switching from another carrier can get the Wiko Ride 3 for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CP3Th"&gt;It’s not unheard of to find a phone at this price, especially through MVNOs, but they’re often refurbished devices or run a previous Android OS generation. The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box — the current generation, at least for a little while longer, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; arrives this fall. Other specs include a 6.09-inch 720p screen, 13-megapixel main camera, and a 3,400mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j9E1FV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Ride 3 stands out by offering Android 11 right out of the box&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XR6uB1"&gt;Boost Mobile was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired by Dish Network&lt;/a&gt; as part of last year’s T-Mobile / Sprint merger deal, and it operates on T-Mobile’s networks — including an older 3G CDMA network that Dish says many Boost customers still rely on. T-Mobile plans to shut down this network at the beginning of 2022; Dish contends the shutdown is earlier than expected, calling it an anti-competitive move that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;could leave many of its customers without service&lt;/a&gt; and accusing T-Mobile of trying to poach those customers in the process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVJ582"&gt;Dish has called on federal and state governments to intervene and delay the shutdown, but in the meantime, it appears to be stocking up on low-cost options for customers who may soon need a new 4G device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook plans to bury users who regularly share misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1kLvjgNn5zefVlN4UjxHj2IWVt4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346740/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHwOYH"&gt;In Facebook’s protracted efforts to be remembered as something other than the largest misinformation megaphone in history, it’s employed a number of strategies, from spinning its own misleading PR narratives to actual UI changes. Today, it announced a new tactic: not only will posts with misinformation in them be made less visible, but so will the individual users who share them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWlqht"&gt;For several years, the social giant has plugged away at fact-checking partnerships meant to disincentivize the spread of viral misinformation, using the results of those checks to label offending posts rather than removing them. In some cases, it’s taken small steps toward hiding things that are found to be false or polarizing — &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-suspended-group-recommendations-election"&gt;ending recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for political groups, for instance, during the 2020 election. Users, however, were free to post whatever they wanted with no consequences to speak of. No longer!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yvXAGxznKAmZg7RvmwYdVKasv8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541344/01_Inline_False_InfoLearn_More.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oIVr7j"&gt;“Starting today, we will reduce the distribution of all posts in News Feed from an individual’s Facebook account if they repeatedly share content that has been rated by one of our fact-checking partners,” the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/taking-action-against-people-who-repeatedly-share-misinformation/"&gt;wrote in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. While demonstrably false posts are already demoted in the News Feed rankings, users who share misinformation regularly will now see all of their content pushed down the dashboard’s endless scroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxP0Ci"&gt;It remains to be seen exactly what the tangible impact of this expanded enforcement will be. While individual Facebook users were previously immune to this sort of scrutiny, Instagram users were not. Nevertheless, vaccine misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90612612/instagram-anti-vaccine-misinformation-problem"&gt;has proliferated&lt;/a&gt; on the photo-sharing app. No matter how sophisticated its systems, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-is-a-slumlord-1837375095"&gt;as I’ve argued before&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook is simply too large to monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n23fsc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV 4K (2021) review: much better remote, slightly faster box</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A new chip and some futureproofing, but no huge changes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NA4uQ5"&gt;It’s easy to be underwhelmed by the new Apple TV 4K. It looks identical to Apple’s first 4K streaming box introduced back in 2017, and the day-to-day experience of using it doesn’t feel dramatically better when compared to that device. The biggest improvement is undoubtedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;the redesigned second-generation Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; that comes bundled with the new Apple TV 4K — but you can buy that separately for $59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEtUqm"&gt;Those who have long sung the Apple TV’s praises will find more to like with this updated hardware. It now has Wi-Fi 6 for speedier, more robust wireless performance. (A gigabit ethernet jack remains on the back for wired connectivity.) Apple has also built in support for Thread, the smart home networking protocol that will &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; be widely supported across the industry — even if it’s good for relatively little right now. The biggest internal change in the latest model is an upgraded chipset: Apple has moved on from the A10X Fusion to the A12 Bionic. But the A12 is far from Apple’s latest and greatest silicon; it first appeared in the iPhone XS line in 2018 and is still currently used in the entry-level iPad and iPad Mini. It’s an improvement, but not some game-changer for Apple’s set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iLMSp1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10519883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxET4M"&gt;On the outside, the Apple TV 4K is impossible to distinguish from its predecessor. It’s still the same nondescript black box that calls little attention to itself on a TV stand. I wish Apple would have done away with the glossy, dust-magnet sides, but we’re not so lucky. The company is sticking with the traditional set-top box form factor even as many competitors have moved to more discreet HDMI dongles that are usually hidden from view behind the TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQl3xb"&gt;There have also been more subtle technical improvements that aren’t being advertised, but it’s the type of stuff video nerds will notice. Apple has mostly resolved an issue with &lt;a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/apple-tv-4k-raised-dolby-vision-black-levels-fixed-on-2021-model-near-black-sdr-flickering.3183975/"&gt;raised blacks in Dolby Vision content&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3fH-v9NwKQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDTVTest’s&lt;/em&gt; Vincent Teoh&lt;/a&gt;. However, the 2021 Apple TV 4K still doesn’t support bitstream audio passthrough, so the company hasn’t addressed all the wants of home theater enthusiasts. But it’s still checking off the essentials like Dolby Vision, Atmos, and HDR10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgrrI1"&gt;The tvOS software experience is identical between this Apple TV 4K and its predecessor. Navigating through menus and Siri voice searches both come with an extra dash of speed, and apps seem to load faster than before. But the differences are often marginal; the 2017 Apple TV 4K still holds up well today in terms of performance. That’s largely because tvOS is very polished at this point, and it doesn’t cheapen the viewing experience with in-your-face ads or sponsored content. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEEcVIBgXK-1bw4weScVml5NO6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529635/DSCF3939.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV’s home screen is still a basic grid of apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IWcyDj"&gt;The Apple TV’s home screen is still the same old static grid of apps, and Apple does what it can to steer you into using its Apple TV app, which aggregates TV shows and movies from numerous services and is also where you’ll find Apple TV Plus originals. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; is coming back soon, in case Apple hasn’t hammered that message into your brain enough already. The Apple TV app is fine and more than competent at recommendations (provided you aren’t looking for anything from Netflix), but aside from the Apple TV Plus section, it hasn’t changed a whole lot and feels stuck in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJPTKZ"&gt;Thankfully, Apple has evolved and added to tvOS elsewhere in recent years with new features like multiuser support, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and HomePod home theater audio. Speaking of which, the new Apple TV 4K lets you play audio through any HDMI device through the original HomePod. I don’t have Apple’s speakers around to try this myself, but early reports suggest that ARC audio works fine for video content. However, latency might be a dealbreaker if you attempt gaming with HomePods as speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKksQG"&gt;Another new trick of tvOS that’s also available on older Apple TV devices is an automatic calibration feature that uses your iPhone’s camera to process color patterns on-screen and adjust the image to make it look as good as possible. This doesn’t actually alter any of your TV’s settings; the Apple TV is optimizing its own picture settings, and you can toggle between this calibrated “balanced” result and the default to see the difference. The consensus seems to be that Apple’s feature can lead to improvements — often producing a warmer image — though most higher-end TVs come with accurate settings out of the box, especially in cinema or calibrated mode. If you’re serious about picture quality, it’s worth doing a legitimate calibration to get the best outcome across all of your TV’s various inputs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Apple TV 4K looks identical to the first model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCFbWZ"&gt;As before, the second-gen Apple TV 4K can serve as &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057"&gt;a hub for your HomeKit accessories&lt;/a&gt;; having a hub lets you control those devices remotely when you’re out of the house. When you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; home, you can quickly access smart home gadgets or pull up camera feeds on-screen with a voice command on the Apple TV 4K. Apple has also included Thread, a wireless communication standard developed specifically for smart home purposes, in the new Apple TV 4K, allowing it to be a hub for Thread devices to connect to and access the internet through. Thread should lead to more reliable connections and faster response times between devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;that support the protocol&lt;/a&gt;; Apple also built it into the HomePod Mini, and it’s the basis of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;forthcoming multiplatform Matter standard&lt;/a&gt;. But other tricks that were once selling points of the Apple TV, like AirPlay, can now be found on many smart TVs and even Roku devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cmMRnq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10519994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eE5sVw"&gt;Video streams on the Apple TV 4K still deliver exceptional quality, but some of the frustrations we mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;nearly four years ago&lt;/a&gt; still remain present in tvOS today. Apple has long enabled the box to match the dynamic range and frame rate of playing content, but not all apps have taken advantage of this feature. So if your preference in video settings is Dolby Vision with dynamic range matching enabled, you’ll still encounter some situations where SDR content looks unappealing due to forced HDR processing. (There’s also a strange bug on the new Apple TV 4K where &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/new-apple-tv-4k-lists-hd-content-incorrectly/"&gt;some movies are being labeled as “HD”&lt;/a&gt; — even when it’s very clear that a 4K file is being streamed.) Setting tvOS to SDR by default with matching enabled leads to the best outcome, though YouTube annoyingly doesn’t flip over to HDR if you do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtY08y"&gt;Live TV integration with Siri remains &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204181"&gt;limited to a frustratingly small list of providers and apps&lt;/a&gt;, though at least ESPN is there. I’d love to see tvOS offer deeper support for live TV apps like Sling TV, YouTube TV, and Hulu with Live TV beyond including them in single sign-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT0KeV"&gt;One argument that Apple TV owners frequently make in support of the hardware’s premium cost is that they appreciate Apple’s stringent privacy policies. The new App Tracking Transparency feature recently introduced on iOS is also present in tvOS. And let me tell you, the number of apps that ask for tracking privileges is quite eye-opening. It feels like on this platform more than any other, I’ve been bombarded with the pop-up asking me whether an app has permission to track me across other apps and websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYDJbs"&gt;Here’s just a sampling of streaming apps that have shown it so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nOHf4q"&gt;ABC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nxWrFa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WnaYq3"&gt;CNN Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LD0XAT"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6KPeaw"&gt;Discovery Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rt9lzV"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DINq8N"&gt;Fox Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nZD87l"&gt;FX Now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XWaKfB"&gt;Hulu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IAH4mx"&gt;Nat Geo TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6uFgBN"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0Nidx"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3zLxsT"&gt;TBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U5ksAd"&gt;TNT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qw2xyJ"&gt;In my experience, Apple doesn’t sync up your chosen preference between iOS and tvOS when it comes to ATT. I’m getting the prompts &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; for all these streaming apps after already having seen them on my iPhone. It’s almost like Apple wants to emphasize how common tracking and data sharing has become among popular streaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1wwNB"&gt;The new Apple TV 4K has been outfitted with an HDMI 2.1 port, but it’s fair to say that Apple isn’t leveraging the full potential of that upgrade. If you’ve been following the next-gen console hype over the last year, you know that the latest Xbox consoles and PlayStation 5 are capable of high frame rates up to 120fps. The Apple TV 4K, meanwhile, tops out at 60fps HDR. Apple still considers this “high frame rate,” and it does lend a noticeable fluidity to sports, nature documentaries, and other videos that were originally shot at higher frame rates. (YouTube now supports 60fps on Apple TV 4K as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CGyVX"&gt;However, that 60fps ceiling is a bummer for games on the platform. No one’s realistically expecting the Apple TV 4K to square off against the latest home consoles or come anywhere close, but 120Hz can still make a difference in responsiveness for titles with simpler graphics. On the subject of games, it’s worth noting that the new Siri Remote can’t be used as a controller like the previous one could; you’ve got to use a third-party gamepad now. The latest Xbox and PlayStation controllers are supported (with haptics included), and tvOS also works with a wide mix of others. It’s overall an improvement if you really want to play games on an Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGfqfNUpkQIqqzKnv6M2f13zTSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529636/DSCF3948_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has redesigned the Siri Remote, which is now larger and much easier to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz3gER"&gt;I covered the new Siri Remote in its own review, but since it comes bundled with the Apple TV 4K, here’s a summary: it’s very, very good. The larger, thicker design is easier to handle (and more difficult to lose), and the circular D-pad will prove more intuitive for a lot of the people who were perplexed by the trackpad on the old remote. The center button still lets you navigate in the same way by nudging your thumb around, but if you liked the large gesture area on the original Siri Remote, this one might feel more limiting. On the whole, I think Apple absolutely made the right move in changing up the design. It’s dramatically simpler to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmz4ZF"&gt;One feature I continue to wish the Apple TV 4K offered is spatial audio for AirPods owners. Being able to have a private bubble of surround sound when watching the biggest screen in your home seems like it could be a visceral experience. I know there are technical challenges and the Apple TV doesn’t have the same sensors as an iPhone or iPad, but I’m hopeful Apple will bring spatial audio to the platform at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4r7YfRKNF6gfIOg1Om2Om31FAds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541102/DSCF3896.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K is expensive, but it delivers a top-notch streaming experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w9u8HW"&gt;If you have the original Apple TV 4K, there’s really no sensible reason to upgrade to the new one. Wi-Fi 6 is nice to have, and Thread might prove important to the smart home someday, but that time isn’t now. Otherwise, you’re getting a slightly faster experience than what the old box is capable of. Just buy the Siri Remote, and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z1xYTu"&gt;But if you’re coming from something older or the wildly overpriced Apple TV HD, the proposition is the same as always: you can get a very good 4K streaming gadget for a fraction of the Apple TV 4K’s price. But it’s unlikely to offer the same user experience or reliable performance. Or maybe some apps won’t support Dolby Vision or Atmos to the same degree they do on Apple TV. The Apple TV 4K is still overpriced, but it’s also still arguably the best streaming experience you’ll find in a single box — especially if you’re entrenched in Apple’s ecosystem. Does this new hardware feel like a true upgrade or big leap from the 2017 Apple TV 4K? No, not really. But at least they got the remote right. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andy Jassy will become Amazon’s CEO on July 5th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CZU304oBOav2JOxI9cphu6TSPso=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346383/670451728.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q0mEM5"&gt;Andy Jassy will officially become the CEO of Amazon on July 5th, the company announced at a shareholder meeting on Wednesday. The company picked that date because it marks 27 years to the day that Amazon was incorporated, according &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dee_bosa/status/1397604817879674882?s=20"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeFT/status/1397604693182795776"&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; who transcribed remarks from outgoing CEO Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYBJaQ"&gt;Amazon announced that Jassy, who is the current CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), would replace Bezos as CEO of the entire company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos will become executive chair of Amazon’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B31r1"&gt;“As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and my other passions,” Bezos said &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=1&amp;amp;imprToken=f6bcd4df-67a6-55b3-d4e&amp;amp;tag=curbedcom06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=w50"&gt;in a statement in February&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW8geF"&gt;Jassy is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;one of the most important executives&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon’s history, having led the hugely successful AWS — the cloud computing technology that underpins Netflix, Spotify, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and other major services — to astronomical heights. He joined the company in the late ’90s and was tasked with exploring what would become AWS around 2003. Since then, it has become a massive revenue-driver for the company, earning $13.5 billion &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;last quarter&lt;/a&gt; alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XJKNPf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="19VJyy"&gt;Jassy is taking the helm of Amazon at a time of significant change and continued growth. Earlier today, Amazon announced that it would be buying film and TV company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;MGM for $8.45 billion&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a huge set of entertainment assets that could help bolster its Amazon Prime Video offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olk3au"&gt;But the company’s massive size and market power have also put it in the spotlight for intense scrutiny from all sides. The DC attorney general launched an antitrust suit against Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453125/dc-attorney-general-amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-favored-nation"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and the company was accused of antitrust violations in the EU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353929/lawsuit-alleges-amazon-failed-breaks-overtime-wages"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327284/eu-investigation-amazon-alexa-google-assistant-apple-siri-internet-of-things-wearables"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22234684/new-lawsuit-accuses-amazon-e-book-price-fixing"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352990/new-york-california-ftc-amazon-investigation-marketplace"&gt;probes&lt;/a&gt; at the state and federal levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geROoO"&gt;And Amazon employees are making increased demands of company leadership, including calling for Bezos and Jassy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453784/amazon-employees-support-palestine-sever-business-contracts"&gt;to support Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;stop polluting near communities of color&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also dealing with the aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;a contentious union drive in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and although employees ultimately failed to secure the necessary votes to form a union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union is contesting the results &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423366/amazon-union-election-appeal-hearing"&gt;in an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLEy2K"&gt;It seems likely that Jassy as CEO will run the company much like Bezos has been, given his long tenure at the company and as a Bezos’ lieutenant for years. But Jassy’s experience making AWS the giant it is today seems to indicate that he’s well-suited for the role — now we’ll just have to see what he does when he takes the top job on July 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BlizzCon 2021 has been canceled</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9qiVQd"&gt;BlizzCon, Blizzard’s annual fan convention, has been canceled this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271059/blizzcon-2020-canceled-blizzard-entertainment"&gt;like it was last year&lt;/a&gt;. However, the company plans to host a “global event” set for “the early part of next year,” &lt;a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us/news/23655116"&gt;the company announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGEQ44"&gt;“Building an in-person BlizzCon is an epic and complex affair that takes many months of preparation—not just for us, but also for the many talented production partners, esports pros, hosts, entertainers, artists, and other collaborators we team up with locally and globally to put all of the pieces together,” Saralyn Smith, BlizzCon’s executive producer, said in a statement. “The ongoing complexities and uncertainties of the pandemic have impacted our ability to properly move forward on many of these fronts, and ultimately we’re now past the point where we’d be able to develop the kind of event we’d want to create for you in November.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8WJyS"&gt;The global event for next year will comprise an online show like the BlizzConline that took place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22285677/blizzcon-2021-news-trailers-diablo-wow-burning-crusade"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; and “smaller in-person gatherings.” The company says it will reveal more about that event in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password’s web extension now supports Touch ID, Windows Hello, and dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Avt2mxiD9j7OJm2-NYfQLEbTXvU=/0x51:1196x848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346263/popup_dark.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBTE5i"&gt;If you use 1Password in your browser, it’s getting a big upgrade: support for biometrics — like Touch ID or Windows Hello (and even some Linux biometrics systems) — dark mode, and a new password-saving and updating UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCj5Ct"&gt;The biometric support will require the desktop version of the app to be installed, but the UI updates, along with the list of other improvements featured in &lt;a href="https://releases.1password.com/b5x/stable/#touch-id-windows-hello-and-biometric-unlock"&gt;1Password’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;, should be coming even if you’re browser-only. (This also includes a welcome language change, where the term “Master Password” has been replaced with just “password.”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clDnhLw_OTMPYYg-XRuv-IO0Fds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541148/browser_touch_id_unlock.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: 1Password&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s beautiful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I9bcwn"&gt;If you’ve been reading this and thinking, “I’ve had most of these features for a long time,” that could be because you’re a Safari user: &lt;a href="https://support.1password.com/safari/"&gt;1Password for Safari&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a different extension from &lt;a href="https://support.1password.com/getting-started-browser/"&gt;the one that’s compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave&lt;/a&gt;. If you use any of those browsers, this update is bringing some very nice changes, which should automatically appear the next time you launch your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google isn’t ready to turn search into a conversation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/28sNo3-CGC6EqAVlMZdLDhIEBZ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69346200/dseifert_171008_2042_4560_02.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOr41H"&gt;The future of search is a conversation — at least, according to Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyVO4J"&gt;It’s a pitch the company has been making for years, and it was the centerpiece of last week’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22435419/google-io-2021-event-recap-biggest-announcements-pixel-android-12-wear-os-workspace"&gt;I/O developer conference&lt;/a&gt;. There, the company demoed two “groundbreaking” AI systems — LaMDA and MUM — that it hopes, one day, to integrate into all its products. To show off its potential, Google had LaMDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;speak &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; the dwarf planet Pluto&lt;/a&gt;, answering questions about the celestial body’s environment and its flyby from the New Horizons probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wcl7bM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s dream is to speak and the machine will answer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="suIVa3"&gt;As this tech is adopted, users will be able to “talk to Google”: using natural language to retrieve information from the web or their personal archives of messages, calendar appointments, photos, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdbAft"&gt;This is more than just marketing for Google. The company has evidently been contemplating what would be a major shift to its core product for years. A &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02274.pdf"&gt;recent research paper&lt;/a&gt; from a quartet of Google engineers titled “Rethinking Search” asks exactly this: is it time to replace “classical” search engines, which provide information by ranking webpages, with AI language models that deliver these answers directly instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMMNz0"&gt;There are two questions to ask here. First is &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; it be done? After years of slow but definite progress, are computers really ready to understand all the nuances of human speech? And secondly, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; it be done? What happens to Google if the company leaves classical search behind? Appropriately enough, neither question has a simple answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="dpYt4k"&gt;Can it be done?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="NP7E2x"&gt;There’s no doubt that Google has been pushing a vision of speech-driven search for a long time now. It debuted Google Voice Search in 2011, then upgraded it to Google Now in 2012; launched Assistant in 2016; and in numerous I/Os since, has foregrounded speech-driven, ambient computing, often with demos of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11702284/google-home-io-2016-ai-voice-search-advertisement"&gt;seamless home life orchestrated by Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cppgHL"&gt;Despite clear advances, I’d argue that actual utility of this technology falls far short of the demos. Check out the introduction below of Google Home in 2016, for example, where Google promises that the device will soon let users “control things beyond the home, like booking a car, ordering dinner, or sending flowers to mom, and much, much more.” Some of these things are now technically feasible, but I don’t think they’re common: speech has  not proven to be the flexible and faultless interface of our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xeusUR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHJ0uOPs4s0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enNSgX"&gt;Everyone will have different experiences, of course, but I find that I only use my voice for very limited tasks. I dictate emails on my computer, set timers on my phone, and play music on my smart speaker. None of these constitute a conversation. They are simple commands, and experience has taught me that if I try anything more complicated, words will fail. Sometimes this is due to not being heard correctly (Siri is atrocious on that score), but often it just makes more sense to tap or type my query into a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjbf13"&gt;Watching this year’s I/O demos I was reminded of the hype surrounding self-driving cars, a technology that has so far failed to deliver on its biggest claims (remember Elon Musk promising that a self-driving car would take a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/10/10746020/elon-musk-tesla-autonomous-driving-predictions-summon"&gt;cross country trip in 2018&lt;/a&gt;? It hasn’t happened yet). There are striking parallels between the fields of autonomous driving and speech tech. Both have seen major improvements in recent years thanks to the arrival of new machine learning techniques coupled with abundant data and cheap computation. But both also struggle with the complexity of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6CRRi"&gt;In the case of self-driving cars, we’ve created vehicles that don’t perform reliably outside of controlled settings. In good weather, with clear road markings, and on wide streets, self-driving cars work well. But steer them into the real world, with its missing signs, sleet and snow, unpredictable drivers, and they are clearly far from fully autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TeTTkP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The richness and flexibility of language make it one of humanity’s greatest tools and one of computer sciences’ greatest challenges”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VH2e9S"&gt;It’s not hard to see the similarity with speech. The technology can handle simple, direct commands that require the recognition of only a small number of verbs and nouns (think “play music,” “check the weather” and so on) as well as a few basic follow-ups, but throw these systems into the deep waters of conversation and they flounder. As Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai commented at I/O last week: “Language is endlessly complex. We use it to tell stories, crack jokes, and share ideas. [...] The richness and flexibility of language make it one of humanity’s greatest tools and one of computer sciences’ greatest challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOolEr"&gt;However, there are reasons to think things are different now (for speech anyway). As Google noted at I/O, it’s had tremendous success with a new machine learning architecture known as Transformers, a model that now underpins the world’s most powerful natural language processing (NLP) systems, including OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Google’s BERT. (If you’re looking for an accessible explanation of the underlying tech and why it’s so good at parsing language, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://daleonai.com/transformers-explained"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Google engineer Dale Markowitz.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdbQSa"&gt;The arrival of Transformers has created a truly incredible, genuinely awe-inspiring flowering of AI language capabilities. As has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; with GPT-3, AI can now generate a seemingly endless variety of text, from poetry to plays, creative fiction to code, and much more, always with surprising ingenuity and verve. They also deliver state-of-the-art results in various speech and linguistic tests and, what’s better, systems scale incredibly well. That means if you pump in more computational power, you get reliable improvements. The supremacy of this paradigm is sometimes known in AI as the “&lt;a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html"&gt;bitter lesson&lt;/a&gt;” and is very good news for companies like Google. After all, they’ve got plenty of compute, and that means there’s lots of road ahead to improve these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HhAVgi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google’s LaMDA AI language demo shows what it’s like to have a chat with Pluto. Yes, the planet. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/sC4aSJImr5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sC4aSJImr5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Verge (@verge) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1394711723714793483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4lJbl"&gt;Google channeled this excitement at I/O. During a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;demo of LaMDA&lt;/a&gt;, which has been trained specifically on conversational dialogue, the AI model pretended first to be Pluto, then a paper airplane, answering questions with imagination, fluency, and (mostly) factual accuracy. “Have you ever had any visitors?” a user asked LaMDA-as-Pluto. The AI responded: “Yes I have had some. The most notable was New Horizons, the spacecraft that visited me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kn7N5p"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/s7t4lLgINyo"&gt;demo of MUM&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-modal model that understands not only text but also image and video, had a similar focus on conversation. When the model was asked: “I’ve hiked Mt. Adams and now want to hike Mt. Fuji next fall, what should I do differently to prepare?” it was smart enough to know that the questioner is not only looking to compare mountains, but that “preparation” means finding weather-appropriate gear and relevant terrain training. If this sort of subtlety can transfer into a commercial product — and that’s obviously a huge, skyscraper-sized &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; — then it would be a genuine step forward for speech computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7Sw4bz"&gt;Should it be done?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wrG7nB"&gt;That, though, brings us to the next big question: even if Google &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; turn speech into a conversation, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; it? I won’t pretend to have a definitive answer to this, but it’s not hard to see big problems ahead if Google goes down this route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4WLqI"&gt;First are the technical problems. The biggest is that it’s impossible for Google (or any company) to reliably validate the answers produced by the sort of language AI the company is currently demoing. There’s no way of knowing exactly what these sorts of models have learned or what the source is for any answer they provide. Their training data usually consists of sizable chunks of the internet and, as you’d expect, this includes both reliable data and garbage misinformation. Any response they give could be pulled from anywhere online. This can also lead them to producing output that reflects the sexist, racist, and biased notions embedded in parts of their training data. And these are criticisms that Google itself has seemingly been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22370158/google-ai-ethics-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing-reputation"&gt;unwilling to reckon with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2Zmu2"&gt;Similarly, although these systems have broad capabilities, and are able to speak on a wide array of topics, their knowledge is ultimately shallow. As Google’s researchers put it in their paper “Rethinking Search,” these systems learn assertions like “the sky is blue,” but not associations or causal relationships. That means that they can easily produce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;bad information&lt;/a&gt; based on their own misunderstanding of how the world works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fk4cmR"&gt;Kevin Lacker, a programmer and former Google search quality engineer, illustrated these sorts of errors in GPT-3 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;this informative blog post&lt;/a&gt;, noting how you can stump the program with common sense questions like “Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?” (GPT-3 says: “A pencil”) and “How many eyes does my foot have?” (A: “Your foot has two eyes”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sRAlSU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI language models “do not have a true understanding of the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lC6eWp"&gt;To quote Google’s engineers again from “Rethinking Search”: these systems “do not have a true understanding of the world, they are prone to hallucinating, and crucially they are incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting documents in the corpus they were trained over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiLwbt"&gt;These issues are amplified by the sort of interface Google is envisioning. Although it’s possible to overcome difficulties with things like sourcing (you can train a model to provide citations, for example, noting the source of each fact it gives), Google imagines every answer being delivered &lt;em&gt;ex cathedra, &lt;/em&gt;as if spoken by Google itself. This potentially creates a burden of trust that doesn’t exist with current search engines, where it’s up to the user to assess the credibility of each source and the context of the information they’re shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXSh3Q"&gt;The pitfalls of removing this context is obvious when we look at Google’s “featured snippets” and “knowledge panels” — cards that Google shows at the top of the Google.com search results page in response to specific queries. These panels highlight answers as if they’re authoritative but the problem is they’re often not, an issue that former search engine blogger (and now Google employee) Danny Sullivan dubbed the “&lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-one-true-answer-problem-featured-snippets-270549"&gt;one true answer&lt;/a&gt;” problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCVF0i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAGOcIyMc5I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cvMv1"&gt;These snippets have &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1192/google-s-featured-snippets-are-worse-than-fake-news"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; when users discover particularly egregious errors. One example from 2017 involved asking Google “Is Obama planning martial law?” and receiving the answer (cited from a conspiracy news site) that, yes, of course he is (if he was, it didn’t happen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtXyDO"&gt;In the demos Google showed at I/O this year of LaMDA and MUM, it seems the company is still leaning toward this “one true answer” format. You ask and the machine answers. In the MUM demo, Google noted that users will also be “given pointers to go deeper on topics,” but it’s clear that the interface the company dreams of is a direct back and forth with Google itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPY1R8"&gt;This will work for some queries, certainly; for simple demands that are the search equivalent of asking Siri to set a timer on my phone (e.g. asking when was Madonna born, who sang “Lucky Star,” and so on). But for complex problems, like those Google demoed at I/O with MUM, I think they’ll fall short. Tasks like planning holidays, researching medical problems, shopping for big-ticket items, looking for DIY advice, or digging into a favorite hobby, all require personal judgement, rather than computer summary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1WO9j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s desire to deliver the “one true answer” could ultimately hurt it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxrzuH"&gt;The question, then, is will Google be able to resist the lure of offering one true answer? Tech watchers have noted &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/"&gt;for a while&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s search products have become more Google-centric over time. The company increasingly buries results under ads that are both external (pointing to third-party companies) and internal (directing users to Google services). I think the “talk to Google” paradigm fits this trend. The underlying motivation is the same: it’s about removing intermediaries and serving users directly, presumably because Google believes it’s best positioned to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf6O5t"&gt;In a way, this is the fulfillment of Google’s corporate mission “to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” But this approach could also undermine what makes the company’s product such a success in the first place. Google isn’t useful because it tells you what you need to know, it’s useful because it helps you find this information for yourself. Google is the index, not the encyclopedia and it shouldn’t sacrifice search for results. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia teases GeForce RTX 3080 Ti announcement for May 31st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z8OUa9Y3BAagQ0BqpTT7uDzGRIo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345761/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPFgKC"&gt;Nvidia is teasing a GeForce event for May 31st, the same day the company is rumored to be launching its new GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. A mysterious 11-second teaser video has appeared on Twitter today, simply revealing a GeForce event for 10PM PT on May 31st, or 1AM ET on June 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJLZoD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419668/nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-leak-may-launch-rumors"&gt;Recent rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti will be revealed alongside the RTX 3070 Ti on May 31st. The RTX 3080 Ti will reportedly include 12GB of GDDR6X memory, a 2GB increase over what’s found on the existing RTX 3080. A wider 384-bit bus is also rumored, matching the RTX 3090 — and an increase to the memory bandwidth over the RTX 3080. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="leiLQg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Get Ready.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/VuDCcKXrry"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VuDCcKXrry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1397568207448326144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLEPWe"&gt;The new RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti will undoubtedly include a hash limit for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;Nvidia introduced this limit&lt;/a&gt; on newly manufactured RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 cards recently, branding new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR” identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RPeB7"&gt;Leaked specs appear to suggest the RTX 3080 Ti will sit between the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, offering performance somewhere between the two. Since the RTX 3090 retails (on paper at least) at $1,499, it’s possible we’ll see RTX 3080 Ti pricing at around the $1,000 mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t22AAA"&gt;Not that retail pricing really matters, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;street prices of new GPUs are utterly out of control&lt;/a&gt;. A global chip shortage has pushed GPU prices up, and demand is still incredibly high during ongoing supply constraints. Nvidia has already warned these supply issues will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;continue throughout 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so launching a new RTX 3080 Ti isn’t going to help here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch two whole seconds of the increasingly real Uncharted movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxRqgWBJKfCv3SwkJIQzT_PbGLk=/58x0:1849x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345755/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_8.37.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark Wahlberg in the &lt;/em&gt;Uncharted&lt;em&gt; movie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yox4PV"&gt;After more than a decade in development and several directors, release dates, and scripts, the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie increasingly seems like it may actually, really, for real become a movie we can watch, thanks in part to our first actual footage (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1397505699308048388"&gt;Twitter user @Nibellion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lWQ1x"&gt;The sneak peek is in this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w"&gt;YouTube video from Sony&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TF8MrJPTy7w?t=92"&gt;timestamped here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to skip right to it). Get excited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mRSHbk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TF8MrJPTy7w?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=93&amp;amp;start=93" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xPeF5A"&gt;Did you blink? If so, you might have missed everything that happened. I made a GIF to make sure you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUnTaHVl-0nKSUtcGnyL17TNTNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540946/May_26_2021_08_08_23.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="487EfB"&gt;Okay, so maybe the two whole seconds here aren’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; exciting. And disappointingly, none of the footage shows any of the &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;-inspired action for which the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; game series is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPX6eZ"&gt;But seeing Tom Holland’s Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg’s Sully actually appearing on camera is a promising sign that the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie will really come out after &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/uncharted-movie-development-hell-a-timeline-of-all/2900-3354/#32"&gt;years in development hell&lt;/a&gt;. And better yet, this is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; shred of evidence we’ve seen this week that the movie is real: &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/business/media/video-game-movies-sony-playstation.html"&gt;a new photo&lt;/a&gt; of Holland and Walhberg in a scene together on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfIOe9"&gt;The movie is currently set to release on February 18th, 2022. Here’s hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eWLUqx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tom Holland’s Nathan Drake revealed in first photo from the long-in-development Uncharted movie","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
