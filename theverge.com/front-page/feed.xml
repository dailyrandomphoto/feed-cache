    <title>Sony will announce its next Xperia phone on April 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOBNYcj159g5nednwfgqgMGRU7s=/342x0:4040x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064144/1iiiresized.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alleged leaked renders of the upcoming Xperia 1 III.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4RFZqA"&gt;Sony has, in a very low-key way, just announced that its upcoming Xperia event will be on April 14th (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/04/01/sony-xperia-announcement-scheduled-for-april-14/"&gt;via D&lt;em&gt;roid Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The news comes from the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SonyXperia/featured"&gt;Xperia YouTube channel’s&lt;/a&gt; banner, where it lays out that there will be a new product announcement happening at 4:30PM Japan Standard Time — that’s 3:30AM EST, or 12:30AM PT (if you feel like burning the midnight oil to watch live). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCpQFG"&gt;The banner gives no real hints as to what will be announced, but there have been a few rumors floating around — one about a new flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254722/sony-xperia-1-iii-leak-periscope-camera"&gt;the Xperia 1 III&lt;/a&gt;, and one about the return of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248890/sony-xperia-compact-2021-android-phone-leak-rumor-size"&gt;Xperia Compact&lt;/a&gt;, which could end up being an Android answer to the iPhone Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H6oaUnRBgiSMcn8nkr7ID0I7pFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414885/channels4_banner.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PUguwx"&gt;It’s worth noting that there are &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-launch-1214221/"&gt;other rumors&lt;/a&gt; that mention new versions of the Xperia 5 and 10, leaving out the Compact entirely. But pretty much every rumor indicates that we’ll see a new entry in the flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;Xperia 1 line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254722/sony-xperia-1-iii-leak-periscope-camera"&gt;Leaks indicate&lt;/a&gt; that the 1 III will have a periscope zoom lens, and &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-xperia-1-iii-specs-and-features-leaked-and-theyre-impressive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techradar&lt;/em&gt; recently published&lt;/a&gt; what could be the full specs. It’s mostly what’s expected from a flagship Android phone: Snapdragon 888, 12GB of memory, 5G, and a 4K 120Hz screen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzAYUR"&gt;It’s probably a safe bet that if there’s only one phone being announced (which is hinted at by the singular “product” in the image from Sony), the Xperia 1 III would be it — the 1 line seems to be on a yearly cycle. The Compact is much more of a wildcard — the last time Sony released a “Compact” branded phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/23/17044006/sony-xperia-xz2-compact-smartphones-leak-mwc-2018"&gt;was in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though it does use the word to market the Xperia 5 II, with its 6.1-inch screen, which is around the same size as an iPhone 12 Pro or Galaxy S21. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248890/sony-xperia-compact-2021-android-phone-leak-rumor-size"&gt;The rumors&lt;/a&gt; for a 2021 version of the Compact say that it’ll have a 5.5-inch display, which is only a tiny bit bigger than the screen on an iPhone Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqzWwU"&gt;Both potential phones are rumored to come with headphone jacks. As for what we’ll actually see on the day, only time will tell — but thankfully there’s not much of it left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams and Xbox Live were down for over two hours but have mostly recovered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSANYePHB1IpzoI8RhL9cRnM0PM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063643/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vfqOe"&gt;Many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Teams and Xbox Live, were down for more than two hours Thursday evening. The company says they have mostly recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlaQL2"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://status.office365.com/"&gt;Office 365 status page&lt;/a&gt; says there was a “DNS issue affecting multiple Microsoft 365 and Azure services” and notes that the issue has been mitigated. Not every service is fully back yet, but the page has a list of services and their current status, and most have recovered fully. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status"&gt;Microsoft 365 status account&lt;/a&gt; first acknowledged that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1377738432265396225"&gt;there was an issue at 5:45PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eD4cMQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have confirmed that the underlying DNS outage has been mitigated. Currently we're validating the recovery of the downstream Microsoft 365 services. Additional details can be found on &lt;a href="https://t.co/AEUj8uAGXl"&gt;https://t.co/AEUj8uAGXl&lt;/a&gt; or MO248163 in your admin center.&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft 365 Status (@MSFT365Status) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1377771854237069316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mU62sh"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status"&gt;Xbox status page&lt;/a&gt; at one point said that many services had a “major outage,” including accounts, multiplayer, and cloud gaming. Most services have recovered, though cloud gaming still has a major outage, according to the status page. Microsoft’s @XboxSupport Twitter account says those issues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1377771393320820739"&gt;should be fixed&lt;/a&gt;, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HM2DKi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The issues launching Cloud Gaming should now be resolved too! Thank you for all the reports, we'll be here and listening.&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Support (@XboxSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1377771393320820739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SR8pRG"&gt;During the outage, the account has also retweeted recent posts from the &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;Twitter account about server issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGjrm0"&gt;Microsoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMwLNg"&gt;This isn’t the only recent Microsoft services outage. Microsoft Teams, Azure, and other Microsoft 365 services went down for about four hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332539/microsoft-teams-down-outage-connectivity-issues"&gt;on March 15th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BbTv9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 1st, 8:16PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Microsoft says the outage is mostly over, so we have adjusted the headline and article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple knew it was selling defective MacBook displays, judge concludes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Flexgate issue causes the display’s backlight to malfunction, dimming at regular intervals near the bottom of the screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0BIfEdVZzmkrPxXolKisYVu6Gs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064097/flexgate_vladsavov1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DAzbE4"&gt;When Apple introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie"&gt;controversial MacBook Pro redesign&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, the company probably didn’t know it was setting itself up to get sued — but not only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344397/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-switches-defective-class-action-lawsuit-certified"&gt;is a class-action lawsuit now underway&lt;/a&gt; for their infamous butterfly keyboards, it’s looking likely there’ll be a second one for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251264/macbook-pro-2018-flexgate-fix-display-cable-2mm-longer"&gt;their notoriously fragile display cables&lt;/a&gt;, too. Judge Edward Davila has decided to let the “flexgate” lawsuit go forward, ruling that Apple should have known that they would fail and yet kept selling them anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGd5Oh"&gt;“The court finds that the allegations of pre-release testing in combination with the allegations of substantial customer complaints are sufficient to show that Apple had exclusive knowledge of the alleged defect,” the judge wrote (via &lt;a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_161732083860310&amp;amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;amp;libId=kmzhlj98010023dg000DLcw7ilyuh&amp;amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F04%2F01%2Fdefective-macs-stage-light%2F&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.law360.com%2Farticles%2F1370714%2Fapple-must-face-trimmed-defective-laptop-display-suit&amp;amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.asana.com%2F&amp;amp;title=Defective%20Macs%20%27knowingly%20sold%20by%20Apple%27%20in%20stage%20light%20case%20-%209to5Mac&amp;amp;txt=Law360"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/01/defective-macs-stage-light/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). You can read the full order at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xokUox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Also known as stage light&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsXos0"&gt;To see what the issue looked like, just take a peek at our picture atop this post; it’s sometimes called the “stage light” issue because of how the cable damage would produce those dark spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kQg0j"&gt;Part of the flexgate controversy is around how Apple addressed the issue when it first got publicity in late 2018 — first by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251264/macbook-pro-2018-flexgate-fix-display-cable-2mm-longer"&gt;silently swapping a new, slightly longer cable&lt;/a&gt; into newer MacBooks, and only opening up one of its typical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634438/flexgate-repair-program-macbook-pro-apple-announced"&gt;free repair programs&lt;/a&gt; months after 15,000 users signed a petition and it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271733/flexgate-display-problem-macbook-pro-apple"&gt;called out in the press&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s been a lot more responsive with issues ever since, such as with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275582/apple-free-replacement-program-macbook-pro-batteries-2016-2017-one-percent"&gt;this free battery replacement program&lt;/a&gt; for a small number of those 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro laptops that won’t charge anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPhNBv"&gt;Unlike the butterfly keyboard suit, the flexgate one doesn’t appear to be a certified class-action lawsuit yet — but there are now nine different plaintiffs lined up in this single case, and the judge is inviting them to submit a new amended complaint. We’ll be watching to see where it goes from there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s H-1B visa freeze is over</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Conservative Union Holds Annual Conference In Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jr4QIiF5bYCA9st8ypuNWxUAZ0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69064073/1304610267.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhGpRs"&gt;Former President Donald Trump’s ban on guest worker visas has expired, allowing foreign workers to reapply for entry into the United States. The news is a win for tech companies including Apple, Twitter, and Google, each of which vocally opposed the policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SZewo"&gt;Former President Donald Trump said the ban was a response to rising unemployment in the United States, due to the coronavirus pandemic. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden pushed back on this claim, calling it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1275430918946263041"&gt;an attempt to distract from the Trump Administration’s failure on the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ0KB6"&gt;The ban focused on H-1B visas, but impacted a broader range of workers, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/01/983579103/biden-allows-trumps-freeze-on-skilled-worker-and-other-visas-to-expire?utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=npr"&gt;NPR reports&lt;/a&gt;. Executives at big corporations and students participating in work-study programs were also caught up in the fray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r59ye1"&gt;Workers already in the United States also had their lives upended. In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21306188/guest-worker-ban-trump-h1b-visa-immigration-stamp-entry"&gt;an Egyptian tech worker in the Bay Area told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he’d planned to go back to Egypt for his brother’s wedding, but now couldn’t leave the country. “I feel like I’m selectively imprisoned,” he said. “If someone from my family gets sick, I can’t go back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1CfwqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The human cost of Trump’s guest worker ban","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21306188/guest-worker-ban-trump-h1b-visa-immigration-stamp-entry"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5OzA7d"&gt;In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300573/h1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was&lt;/a&gt; “deeply disappointed” by the ban. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1275192967658119169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1275192967658119169%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F6%2F23%2F21300573%2Fh1b-visa-ban-tim-cook-twitter-donald-trump-statement"&gt;Twitter said it undermined&lt;/a&gt; “America’s greatest economic asset: its diversity.” Both companies rely on H-1B visas to hire foreign workers without going through the traditional immigration process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lek4YZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like Apple, this nation of immigrants has always found strength in our diversity, and hope in the enduring promise of the American Dream. There is no new prosperity without both. Deeply disappointed by this proclamation.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1275407136256712707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OW0mH"&gt;In an announcement on April 1st, the state department &lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/update-on-presidential-proclamation-10052.html"&gt;said workers who were refused visas&lt;/a&gt; due to Trump’s restrictions will now have to submit new applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsttZi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7lGGF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Atari’s restless ghost has released NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7reZk0pOz9ZMPBF97Brt0nl9vE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063771/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gumS06"&gt;Atari, the corporate entity / brand of Theseus, has just made around $110,000 by selling —you guessed it — NFTs (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/ataris-corporate-zombie-raises-110000-overnight-from-centipede-nfts"&gt;shout out to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for doing the math). The tokens in question are 3D models of the Atari 2600 game cartridge for &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt; — 10 of them black, 100 of them red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiMgs6"&gt;The NFTs are being sold as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/launches-atari-capsule-collection"&gt;Atari Capsule Collection&lt;/a&gt; — which is basically a bunch of &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt;-themed NFTs being sold by the company that now owns the Atari brand. The company and its intellectual property have been bought and sold so many times it’s almost hard to keep track, but the current incarnation of it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083746/atari-hotels-esports-true-north-studio-gsd-group-phoenix-game-rooms"&gt;mainly known for trying to build hotels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20907755/atari-vcs-troubled-development-architect-operating-system-crowdfunding-campaign"&gt;struggling to make a game console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This NFT, labeled as version 1 of 30, sold for around $18,000 worth of Ether.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UiqPxr"&gt;As jaded as I am, I can admit that there’s at least one interesting part of Atari’s NFT offerings: the &lt;em&gt;Flagship Centipede&lt;/em&gt;. According to the company, the NFT part is just another 3D model, but the first person to buy it will get a a real-life, original and restored &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt; arcade cabinet. But if the regular NFTs that just included a 3D model were selling for thousands of dollars, I don’t even want to think about how much that one will sell for. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2Zwy6KwfBa6KkSlwxUGdGZxlMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414557/image004.png"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;Flagship Centipede&lt;em&gt; NFT, digitally signed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dona_Bailey" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the game’s creator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I wonder if she’ll get any of the money from the sale.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LfK86N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22332695/nft-news-stories-collection-cryptoart-memes-explainer"&gt;We talk about NFTs a lot&lt;/a&gt;, often as collectors’ items, but these ones are particularly baffling — they sold from $180.78 to over $16,000. As &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;points out that if you wanted to get a real &lt;em&gt;Centipede &lt;/em&gt;2600 cartridge, with the box, manual, and everything, you could go to eBay and spend $30 (or $53 if you want it sealed). Collector-grade versions of the game have &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193679073442%3Fmkevt%3D1%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26campid%3D5336510469%26customid%3DG15153_abTestName-control%26toolid%3D10001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362707%2Fatari-corporate-entity-centipede-nft-sale-pong-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently sold for around&lt;/a&gt; $500, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FCentipede-Atari-2600-1981-Wata-9-0-A-Seal%2F303938082140%3Fepid%3D2489%26hash%3Ditem46c41f155c%3Ag%3AbzAAAOSwal1f39g4&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362707%2Fatari-corporate-entity-centipede-nft-sale-pong-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctions for them start in that territory too&lt;/a&gt;. Even original &lt;em&gt;Centipede &lt;/em&gt;arcade cabinets cost less than some of these NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YjdwQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xL9Lx"&gt;If the point is to feel like you own something, that you’ve collected it, which would give you more of that feeling: an NFT or a copy of the actual game? The NFT would give you an entry on the blockchain, certifying that you own a 3D model (which is identical to all the other versions), but a physical cartridge can be displayed on a shelf or actually played. And that’s not even considering the physical versions that have history — you could always try to track down one of the versions of the game that Atari &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/11/6137415/atari-games-found-in-a-new-mexico-landfill-will-be-given-to-museums"&gt;buried in the desert back in 1983&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve sold on eBay before &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FAtari-Game-Over-Dig-Alamogordo-Centipede-Rare-%2F184680251456%3Fhash%3Ditem2affcd0040%253Ag%253A2wUAAOSwOFtgNnhE%26nma%3Dtrue%26si%3Dif0NSspoU%25252B38hUu0n9JLwUjg1L4%25253D%26orig_cvip%3Dtrue%26nordt%3Dtrue%26rt%3Dnc%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.l2557&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362707%2Fatari-corporate-entity-centipede-nft-sale-pong-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for around $600&lt;/a&gt;, and come with an origin story that can’t really be matched by an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azAneM"&gt;And if you needed one more reason why you should save your money and just buy a physical copy of &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt;, here’s the kicker: those were made by the actual, original Atari, not the corporate entity that happens to own its name these days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>French police are investigating an international Lego crime ring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="lego" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xWjNJaByQ68D5frPfWy7EAYyQE=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063733/Lego.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EGio7"&gt;It sounds like something out of a children’s movie — after French police arrested three Polish thieves who attempted to steal toys in June 2020, specifically Lego sets. Now authorities are trying to address a growing trend of Lego robberies by warning business owners and parents, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/french-police-on-trail-of-international-gang-of-lego-looters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTN1zX"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/ile-de-france-le-gang-des-voleurs-de-lego-ecumait-les-magasins-de-jouets-28-03-2021-8430057.php"&gt;a report in &lt;em&gt;Le Parisien&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the thieves were part of a gang that would stay in hotels near Paris, drive around in an Audi, and “raid” toy stores for valuable Lego sets to resell in Poland. The thieves were caught robbing a PicWicToys toy store, after being spotted in 2019 and 2020 at two separate European toy stores, La Grande Récré and Maxi Toys. French police are reportedly “building a case” against the gang in response, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtlMsy"&gt;The idea that plastic Lego bricks are worth enough to entice an international ring of thieves to steal them might seem odd — the priciest Lego set ever made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16234244/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-set-7541-pieces-800-dollars"&gt;retailed for only $800&lt;/a&gt; — but some sets can be worth more over time. On top of that, Gerben van IJken, a Lego specialist who advises online collectible auction sites, tells &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; that interest in reselling Lego has grown dramatically in the last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cyNttK"&gt;Investing in these pieces isn’t new but this niche market has reached new heights with the pandemic. People have more time at home because of the health restrictions and the game market has exploded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="h7mhAK"&gt;Van IJken cites one Lego set that retailed for €150 (around $212) in 2007 and resold for €2,500 (around $2,943) in 2020. That growth in value could be due to Lego’s practice of cycling sets out of production after around two years, van Ijken says. Keeping older sets “in the vault” (reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Vault"&gt;Disney’s strategy with home video&lt;/a&gt;) makes the ones still on the market or in owner’s hands that much more rare and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFhf4G"&gt;Lego thievery isn’t limited to France, either. A man reportedly stole around &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-lego-bandit-dupage-met-0714-20150713-story.html"&gt;two million dollars worth of Lego sets&lt;/a&gt; in Florida in 2012. Given the risk, if you’ve got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345026/lego-space-shuttle-nasa-discovery-columbia-hubble-telescope"&gt;collectible Lego space shuttle&lt;/a&gt; on the way, it might be time to think about security.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s first UWB tracker, the SmartTag Plus, appears to be nearly here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utqWFZH02friWumTpDGxiYiKBwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063627/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NDSpPH"&gt;Samsung announced its Galaxy SmartTag line of item trackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time, it said the premium SmartTag Plus, which has ultra-wideband (UWB) technology that enables more precise tracking of an item in relationship to you than Bluetooth does, would be releasing later this year. Now, though, there are some clues that the SmartTag Plus could be coming out soon, possibly as early as April 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU1ugg"&gt;Perhaps the most telling hint pointing to the SmartTag Plus’ imminent arrival is that retailer B&amp;amp;H Photo already has the black model of the device available for preorder, with an “expected availability” of April 12th. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614513-REG%2Fsamsung_ei_t7300bbegus_galaxy_smarttag_plus_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362785%2Fsamsung-smarttag-plus-uwb-ultra-wideband-item-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s a link to the B&amp;amp;H listing&lt;/a&gt; if you want to try to preorder a SmartTag Plus for yourself. But since Samsung hasn’t shared this date itself just yet, it’s possible B&amp;amp;H could shift this expected date if it’s not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLRnCKyk4n3zPg1EMsjhWnEjGcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414535/Screen_Shot_2021_04_01_at_1.49.11_PM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HITMWT"&gt;The upcoming item tracker also appeared in Federal Communications Commission filings &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A3LEIT7300"&gt;made public on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. That can be an indication that a product will be available for sale in the near future, but it’s no guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cVhlD"&gt;Samsung isn’t the only company interested in UWB tech. Apple has long been rumored to be working on a UWB-equipped item tracker of its own, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;supposedly called AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in January that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/kuo-airtags-ar-device-2021/"&gt;plans to release them this year&lt;/a&gt;. Tile is also reportedly preparing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;its own item tracker with UWB&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4pLcf"&gt;Apple has also built its U1 chip that enables UWB into the iPhone 11 and 12 series and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, but so far, it hasn’t used the technology for much except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;more a precise AirDrop&lt;/a&gt;. The U1 chip will also let &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;BMW iX&lt;/a&gt; owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;wirelessly unlock their cars&lt;/a&gt; when the vehicle is released later this year in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Duolingo adds Yiddish to the menu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BX7Siqcy1hGXnWA97ie_mTWFduc=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063465/SM_YiddishLaunchDayImage.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Art: Duotrope&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sQ6giZ"&gt;Duolingo, the popular language learning app, offers a wide variety of languages in its list of courses. While it’s known for teaching well-known tongues such as French, Spanish, and Chinese, it has also added courses in languages that are less widely used, such as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Hawaiian — and now, as of April 6th, its 40th language: Yiddish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fUYeF"&gt;While Yiddish in the US is known more for some of the words that have entered the popular lexicon (“He’s such a schmuck!”), it is actually a full-scale language. An amalgamation of High German, Hebrew, and Aramaic, with a smattering of Slavic languages (and more recently, English), before World War II, it was widely spoken by Jewish communities living throughout Central and Eastern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PW4FrO"&gt;These days, Yiddish as a day-to-day language tends to be spoken mainly in Chassidic and Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jewish communities, although there has been a strong interest in Yiddish among many of the descendants of European Yiddish speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyJyYwPUS1dRA82bwsMxKY54DiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414346/Image_from_iOS__4___1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQT8dkLB5MdhFrnfKDLaX7X6jjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414348/IMG_5606__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V5GLug"&gt;For example, while my family no longer speaks Yiddish on a daily basis, my parents grew up speaking the language and sent me to an after-school program for several years so I could learn it as well. While I am no longer anywhere near as fluent as I once was, I can still manage “a bisl Yiddish” (a little Yiddish), so I asked Duolingo if I could try out its Yiddish course ahead of time to see how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYMLHA"&gt;I’m not unfamiliar with Duolingo — I’ve been using the app to try to relearn my high school Spanish — and I found that the Yiddish course follows the app’s familiar methodology. It starts by testing you on your existing knowledge of a language, assuming you’re not starting from scratch. (Mine turned out to be fair but not great.) It then starts, through repetition and examples, taking you through the basics and then into conversation, using different subjects (such as going to a restaurant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGDvuW"&gt;The version of the app I was working with still had some beta glitches. For example, each time you click on a word, a voice is supposed to repeat it out loud, and a few of the words were missing. I was also interested to find that a couple of the words were pronounced quite differently than I was used to, but I wasn’t sure whether that was another beta glitch or an indication of the dialect being used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BD6ILd"&gt;And that’s one of the catches in teaching any language. Because Yiddish was once spread out among a wide range of countries, there was also a wide range of dialects spoken. I remember my grandparents being very amused because the dialect I was learning in school was so different from the one they’d grown up with. According to Duolingo, its Yiddish course uses the Chassidic Hungarian pronunciations because that is currently the most widely used, while the grammar is based on the version standardized by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research (which is the grammar that I was taught).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zs9L5n"&gt;I’ll be curious to discover where these differences show themselves as I proceed to the more advanced levels. In the meantime, to promote its new Yiddish course, Duolingo has arranged with several delis around the US — Katz’s Deli in NYC, Manny’s Deli in Chicago, Factor’s Famous Deli in Los Angeles, Zak the Baker in Miami, and Pigeon Bagels in Pittsburgh — to give away free bagels with a schmear (cream cheese) on April 6th to customers who try to order (with the help of some onsite signs) in Yiddish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhDUOQ"&gt;Those of us who don’t live close to one of those venues, or who are still avoiding onsite shopping, will have to make do with noshing food from our own fridges while we learn a bisl Yiddish. Duolingo is available on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french/id570060128"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"&gt;the web&lt;/a&gt;; the basic app is free, or you can get rid of ads and track your process for $7 per month. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdvayV"&gt;Myanmar’s acting military leadership has shut down broadband internet service indefinitely in response to ongoing protests, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/01/myanmar-military-internet-shutdown-bloodbath/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. The move comes two months after a military junta &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/world/asia/myanmar-coup-aung-san-suu-kyi.html"&gt;staged a coup&lt;/a&gt; to depose the country’s democratically elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVs84d"&gt;The shutdown applies to wireless broadband service, while a separate order banning mobile internet at night remains in effect, &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-04-01/myanmar-orders-wireless-internet-shutdown-until-further-notice-telecoms-sources"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The orders were given to state telecoms, though no official reason has been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RfX075"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT⛔️ Fixed wireless will not be turned on in morning. Confirmed. No Ananda/MMNet/Ooreddoo/etc. With mobile data already off, only fixed-line will remain.  Order is temporary but open-ended. Everyone should be making whatever plans are possible.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhatsHappeningInMyanmar?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WhatsHappeningInMyanmar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Free Expression Myanmar (@FreeExpressMm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FreeExpressMm/status/1377587527901708288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oYYPMu"&gt;NetBlocks, an advocacy group that tracks internet disruptions and shutdowns aimed at quashing dissent, has also confirmed the ongoing Myanmar shutdown timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zw3IV1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update: Mobile data is cut in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Myanmar?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; for an 18th day as limited internet is restored from 9 am Thursday morning local time after the 46th consecutive night of post-coup shutdowns. Online platforms remain heavily restricted  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhatsHappeningInMyanmar?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WhatsHappeningInMyanmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7Zf5NbNvmi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7Zf5NbNvmi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NetBlocks (@netblocks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1377454979443744773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNEszD"&gt;Myanmar is currently embroiled in protests against the military government, which has responded with increasingly totalitarian surveillance and censorship measures in addition to violence that has left more than 500 dead and thousands arrested since February, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/01/myanmar-military-internet-shutdown-bloodbath/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZqthR"&gt;The internet shutdowns have now reached a new level of severity, with multiple telecoms ordered to shut off various internet services like mobile data, roaming, and public Wi-Fi for different lengths of time. The efforts appear designed to interfere with protestor organizing and to prevent Myanmar citizens, journalists, and human rights activists from more easily broadcasting what’s happening on the ground to the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEpyUp"&gt;In addition to the communications blackout and physical violence, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/world/asia/myanmar-coup-military-surveillance.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; Myanmar’s military is using surveillance drones, phone-hacking devices (including European-made iPhone hacking tools), and software for cracking personal computer security as part of a widespread digital offensive against the opposition. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube stars the Stokes Twins avoid jail after pleading guilty over fake bank robbery pranks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z8TJmy"&gt;Alan and Alex Stokes, twin brothers who rose to fame on YouTube filming prank videos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor false imprisonment and reporting false emergencies in connection with a pair of now-removed videos they filmed in the fall of 2019 in which they pretended to have just robbed a bank. The 23-year-old brothers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356403/stokes-twins-youtube-felony-charge-bank-robbery-prank-video"&gt;charged in August of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktdx8i"&gt;They faced a maximum of five years in prison if convicted on all counts, leading to the guilty plea in exchange for reduced sentences, according to a &lt;a href="http://orangecountyda.org/civica/press/display.asp?layout=15&amp;amp;Entry=6126"&gt;press release put out dated March 31st&lt;/a&gt; by the office of the district attorney of Orange County, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyIFUD"&gt;“The guilty pleas were in exchange for a judge reducing the felony false imprisonment charge to a misdemeanor. Prosecutors objected on the record and in a trial brief to the court’s offer to reduce the felony charge to a misdemeanor,” the press release states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8wzfnq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These crimes could have easily resulted in someone being seriously hurt or killed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dsuinD"&gt;Both received a sentence including 160 hours of community service and one year of probation in addition to both having to pay restitution. The Stokes brothers are also barred from returning to the University of California Irvine, where they filmed the prank videos, and they were also ordered not to produce any more videos “that mimic criminal behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECCuIT"&gt;The videos in question involved the Stokes brothers dressing in black garb with face masks filming themselves interacting with strangers, some of whom were distraught at the prospect of encountering what they believed were on-the-run criminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isb0Rz"&gt;In one poorly thought-out situation filmed for the videos, the brothers called an Uber driver and demanded they be taken somewhere. The driver refused, but he was later questioned by law enforcement who initially approached the man with their guns drawn, mistakenly believing he was involved after numerous bystanders called law enforcement on the brothers for thinking they were attempting to carjack the driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmGURr"&gt;The brothers pulled this prank twice in the same day on October 15th, 2019, choosing to film the second of the two videos at the University of California Irvine after already having been questioned and released by police elsewhere in Orange County earlier in the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIQh71"&gt;“These crimes could have easily resulted in someone being seriously hurt or killed,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement. “An active bank robbery is not a casual police response and these police officers were literally risking their lives to help people they believed were in danger. It is irresponsible and reckless that these two individuals cared more about increasing their number of followers on the internet than the safety of those police officers or the safety of the innocent Uber driver who was ordered out of his car at gunpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6MEtV"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StokesTwins/videos"&gt;Stokes Twins YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; remains active with more than 6.6 million subscribers. The most recent video, titled “FUNNY April Fool’s Pranks on Friends!,” was posted two days ago, and it’s already amassed 1.4 million views. &lt;/p&gt;
