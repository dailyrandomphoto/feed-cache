    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFSC2h-JZ0-lcBTLwMcFwudM67E=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/LG_A1_OLED_Lifestyle_Press_Image.16.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s A1 OLED is now available for just shy of $900, making it one of the most affordable OLEDs to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And while we saw some incredible TV deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, fret not, as there are still plenty available for those looking to pick up a TV for the holidays. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="E3xT2B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PBNYtv"&gt;Select a category&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the PlayStation and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1I1ma7"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reason. It’s not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cart-6484511"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $599.99, the TV’s best price to date. The retailer is also offering a three-month Apple TV Plus subscription to new subscribers and $50 off a Google Nest Hub smart display with each purchase, as well as up to $200 off select soundbars and home theater systems. Walmart also is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1192602/9383?subId1=TheVergeBest4KTVDeals12221&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F482924%2F1192602%2F9383%3FsubId1%3DTheVergeBest4KTVDeals12221%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FSony-55-Class-KD55X80J-4K-Ultra-HD-LED-Smart-Google-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-HDR-X80J-Series-2021-model%252F919937738%26veh%3Daff&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting the TV down to $648&lt;/a&gt;, however, without the added incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885F5GMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $699.99&lt;/a&gt;, though, we’ve seen the R635 drop to as low as $650 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 65- and 75-inch variants. Both retailers are offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $999.99&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVnwOsusm3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch for $1299.99&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, however, Best Buy will also take $90 off Facebook Portal TV, if you purchase the two together. The retailer is even throwing in 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, so long as you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 55-inch drop from $1,500 to $998, its best price ever. Sadly, it’s now only $100 off, with the 55-inch model going for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,397.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Like with other TVs, Best Buy is also offering a $90 discount on the $150 Facebook Portal TV, as well as anywhere between $50 and $300 off on select soundbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JD5CqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ewayql"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok is now available on Samsung and LG TVs, Android TV devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796353/tiktok-tv-app-now-available-samsung-lg-google-android-tv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="hGcbAW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"},{"title":"How to choose the right TV for your home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973993/tv-buying-guide-oled-qled-lcd-hdr-dolby-vision-atmos-nits-backlighting"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Right now, you can pick up the 55-inch model from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $369.99&lt;/a&gt;, a $180 discount on what is its typical $549.99 price tag. Again, Best Buy will also take $90 off of Facebook Portal TV. Amazon, meanwhile, is also offering a modest discount on the TV but in other configurations. The retailer is selling the 43-inch, for example, for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7K3H7K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$249.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $289.99 and the 70-inch for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08CVV2Z32/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$549.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of normally $579.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $499.99. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at Amazon, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924WG7JD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $399.99 ($120 off)&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching the TV’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-Series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for all Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. You can currently get the 55-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08GWBBH4R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$379.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $220 less than the usual retail price. Other sizes are also on sale, like the 85-inch, which is currently going for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08RGB3P6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,899 — its best price on Amazon yet. We also recently saw the 50-inch drop to as low as $250, but it’s now only available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHFX4FV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$359.99&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not as steep as a discount, but it still saves you about $140. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPPi6g"&gt;Amazon’s first TV, the Omni Fire 4K TV, only just recently launched and starts at $370. The self-branded effort features the ability to query Alexa even when the TV is off, as well as a low input lag and support for two-way video calling. We gave it a 7/10 in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, while noting how the TV shows great promise thanks to its robust Alexa integration and support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, among other things. At the same time, however, TCL and other similarly priced television makers offer better picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u57i5n"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon was taking up to $150 off on select models, even going so far as to sell the 55-inch configuration for $410 instead of $560. Amazon has since raised the prices, but you can still buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $419.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $559.99. Larger and smaller configurations are also on sale, with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch going for $729.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $829.99. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7NAAAq36n" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is offering comparable sales on various sizes, while also offering a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV if you purchase the two together. Note, however, only the larger 65-inch and 75-inch models include support for Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="robl5C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality you can get in a mainstream TV, and many were heavily discounted during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you missed out on those sales, however, you may still have another shot at landing a good deal, as many of the best models are still currently available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;Right now, Best Buy and Amazon are discounting select sizes of the LG’s entry-level A1 OLED, selling the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-48-class-a1-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6461914.p&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $899.99&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$896.99&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The 4K A1 offers support for both Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as an automatic low-latency mode. Unlike more expensive OLEDs, however, it doesn’t come with a slate of advanced gaming features, like those found on LG’s C1 model. It offers a slower 60Hz display and lacks HDMI 2.1, for example, and doesn’t support a variable refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cKOBk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EC2RcQ"&gt;Unlike the A1, LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports Dolby Atmos as well as 4K at 120Hz and a variable refresh rate. At the moment, the popular 65-inch model is discounted to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9xg5aTnsu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,709.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; ($90 off). The smaller, 55-inch model is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FLGOLED55BXPUA&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at BuyDig for $1,369.99&lt;/a&gt;, 14 percent less than the OLED’s typical retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or next-gen consoles. Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for as low as $1,618.99&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy instead of $1,800. You can also buy it for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555065-REG%2Flg_oled55gxpua_gxpua_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,696.99 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or grab the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555068-REG%2Flg_oled65gxpua_gxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model at B&amp;amp;H for $2,297&lt;/a&gt;, which will save you $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED remains a Best Buy exclusive. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVB68Xg6uj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can currently get it for just $999.99&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date, and it remains one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for an OLED. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. If you prefer a larger size, the 65-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVCblSKnxi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also available for $1,499.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, a cool $300 off the list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8lGs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ubtWst"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line has slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It’s currently available in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, there's a $75 discount available on the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVowrPgJjE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and a larger $800 discount &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVCmbeDxyh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on the 77-inch configuration&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to $1,424.99 and $2,999.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJNcm"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,296.99 and $1,299.99, two of the lowest prices to date on the excellent OLED. You can also pick up the smaller, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $1,199.99&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy instead of $1,299.99, and the retailer will throw in a $200 discount on select soundbars as well as a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is also offering discounts on the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vUccDGJT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;-, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vUWfg4Xb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;77-&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vVCUSyDE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;83-inch&lt;/a&gt; variants, with the largest model selling for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vUccDGJT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$4,999.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IrDSVn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn523S"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for as low as $1,299.99 ($500 off), however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are currently only discounting the TV to around $1,600 ($200 off). There are also varying discounts available on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3B227H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch configurations&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel Buds A-Series getting more options with firmware update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1cGUK68BUHLFA6_IqX6t-I_KIAY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237477/cwelch_20210528_4608_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q2DnAy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/139020686/new-features-coming-to-pixel-buds-a-series?hl=en"&gt;Google is releasing&lt;/a&gt; an update for its Pixel Buds A-Series wireless headphones, which will add a bass slider, a loudness compensation setting for better bass and treble response at low volumes, and a nice connectivity improvement (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/06/pixel-buds-a-series-update-brings-much-needed-bass-controls-and-better-device-switching/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Given that the buds are only $99 (or free, if you got them with &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/10/pixel-6-buyers-will-get-their-free-pixel-buds-even-if-they-forgot-to-order.html"&gt;a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro preorder&lt;/a&gt;), it’s nice to see Google adding new features through software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oXJLE"&gt;As we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820593/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-quick-tap-to-snap-shortcut-ultra-wideband-nearby-share"&gt;learned earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, the Pixel Buds will be getting more control over the bass response. The buds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;had a “bass boost” option before&lt;/a&gt;, but now you’ll be able to turn up the bass using a four-step slider — and you can even turn it down a notch if that’s what you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="igs58P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series can fall back if they can’t connect to the last-used device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlx8YC"&gt;Google also says that if the Pixel Buds A-Series can’t connect to the last device you used them with, they’ll try to fall back to the device they were connected to before that. For example, if you were using the buds with your laptop that’s currently off, they could connect to your phone automatically when you take them out of the case if you had them connected to your phone before using them with your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRiYbm"&gt;Google says that the update, version 282, should be “rolling out over the coming days” and will install automatically if you’re using a Pixel running Android 10 or higher or if you’re using any phone with Android 6 or above that has the Pixel Buds app installed (as long as it has permission to see nearby devices). If you don’t like waiting for automatic updates, Google does provide instructions on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9642078"&gt;how to manually check for an update&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vPlHIe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel Buds A-Series review: price is everything","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Japan puts new restrictions on stablecoins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpSDQonmGGUdue_GtNEbnqGXhQ8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237350/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocfEBj"&gt;Japan is proposing new restrictions that would only allow banks and wire transfer services to issue stablecoins, first reported by &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Stablecoins-to-face-new-restrictions-in-Japan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5kUb1"&gt;Stablecoins are a type of digital currency that’s pegged to an external asset, like a fiat currency, gold, or other investments, in an attempt to keep the coin at a stable price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"&gt;Tether is one example&lt;/a&gt; of a stablecoin, and it’s no stranger to controversy. In October, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728253/tether-41-million-misleading-statements-fiat-currency-bitfinex-cftc"&gt;was fined $41 million&lt;/a&gt; for old claims that each token was backed 1-to-1 by its cash reserves — according to the CFTC, “Tether reserves were not ‘fully backed’ the majority of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pjn6jK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This follows similar plans to regulate stablecoins in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CaI2Ay"&gt;The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to introduce the legislation in 2022, following similar plans to regulate stablecoins in the US. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"&gt;the US Treasury Department encouraged Congress&lt;/a&gt; to pass legislation that would prevent any other entities besides banks from issuing the currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqNPnX"&gt;The Treasury cites that this would help stave off “runs” in which people start cashing out coins all at once in fear that the issuer of the currency may go under, potentially destabilizing other financial markets as a result. Shortly after, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that the agencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800740/cryptocurrency-us-banking-regulation-clarification-financial-institutions-stablecoins"&gt;planned to clarify the rules and regulations&lt;/a&gt; surrounding cryptocurrencies in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptiKc7"&gt;In addition to the limitations on issuing stablecoins, Japan’s FSA also intends to tighten other rules. The agency will oversee wallet providers that engage in stablecoin transactions and require them to follow certain security protocols, like reporting any suspicious activity and verifying users’ identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaMej4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/consortium-japan-firms-test-launch-digital-currency-nikkei-2021-11-23/"&gt;Japan also plans on launching a yen-based cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. The currency — which may be called DCJPY — will be backed by bank transactions and is supposed to expedite large transfers of funds between companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund commits another $443 million to climate justice and conservation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Week NYC Leaders Reception" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRcwrLPWPM5oLV6scd9IFOHD2N4=/0x144:4428x3096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237330/1341676182.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 20: Jeff Bezos speaks during the Climate Week NYC Leaders’ Reception | Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Bezos Earth Fund&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k9nzvz"&gt;On Monday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced his Earth Fund’s &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bezos-earth-fund-announces-443-million-in-grants-to-advance-environmental-justice-conserve-and-restore-nature-and-improve-monitoring-and-accountability-301437650.html"&gt;latest round of grants&lt;/a&gt;: $443 million to be spent primarily on land conservation and restoration and efforts to reduce environmental burdens on marginalized communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcnu6C"&gt;This year, the fund has pledged more than $3 billion for similar initiatives. In 2020, Bezos promised to funnel $10 billion — about 5 percent of his current net worth — toward tackling climate change this decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="85ShzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From the beginning, the Bezos Earth Fund has faced criticism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CzR1W"&gt;From the beginning, the Bezos Earth Fund has faced &lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/bezos-earth-fund-is-an-unnatural-disaster/"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from some grassroots environmental groups. At first, Bezos primarily funded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;big-name environmental groups&lt;/a&gt; with historically white leadership and comparatively large budgets rather than supporting more Indigenous and people of color-led community groups, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;critics pointed out&lt;/a&gt;. Other criticisms focused on how Amazon, the e-commerce giant Bezos founded, continues to pollute neighborhoods and emit increasing levels of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LSxWQ"&gt;Since that early backlash, environmental justice — a movement to stop pollution and environmental degradation from disproportionately harming low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and other vulnerable groups — has become a bigger part of the Bezos Earth Fund’s messaging. The fund’s latest round of funding sets aside $130 million for 19 different organizations doing “&lt;a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/announcements"&gt;doing critical climate justice work.&lt;/a&gt;” It follows another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662529/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-150-million-climate-justice-amazon"&gt;$150 million&lt;/a&gt; pledged to climate justice groups in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YDmU7"&gt;The $130 million for environmental justice in this latest round of funding is intended to support the Biden administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/"&gt;Justice40 Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after stepping into office in January, Biden created the initiative through an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that “disadvantaged communities” receive 40 percent of the “overall benefits” of federal investments in clean energy and climate action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oHBBQ"&gt;Bezos’ grantees include a wide range of groups that either gather data to inform policymaking, help underserved communities become more resilient to climate change, support tribes and Native communities, or plan to create training programs for the Justice40 initiative. For example, GRID Alternatives, a nonprofit that works to increase access to solar power, will get $12 million for its Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEYvQF"&gt;The latest funding announcement also includes $261 million allocated to the &lt;a href="https://www.campaignfornature.org/cop15-countries-call-for-support-of-30x30-and-leaders-endorse-indigenous-rights-but-finance-commitments-fall-short"&gt;international initiative&lt;/a&gt; to conserve 30 percent of Earth’s lands and oceans by 2030. That will focus on creating, expanding, and monitoring so-called “protected areas” — mostly in the Congo Basin and Tropical Andes. According to the Bezos Earth Fund, the grants will create 11 million hectares of newly protected areas in the Congo Basin, where 70 percent of Africa’s forests are located. In the Tropical Andes, another important carbon sink for the planet, the grants will convert an estimated 48 million hectares into protected areas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NohxsA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creating, expanding, and monitoring so-called “protected areas”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8vOFe"&gt;Forests and other ecosystems are extremely important in the fight against climate change because they trap and store carbon dioxide, keeping it out of the atmosphere. But the establishment of new protected areas, especially when not carefully implemented, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770463/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-landscape-restoration-conservation-trees-indigenous-peoples"&gt;can actually harm local communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/Conservation.aspx"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.2021.1924574?journalCode=venv20"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of conservation efforts forcing Indigenous peoples off their lands to create national parks. The World Wildlife Fund, which is among Bezos’ grantees, was recently accused of failing to take responsibility for human rights abuses during a &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2021/11/wwf-distances-itself-from-rights-abuses-at-u-s-congressional-hearing/"&gt;US Congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;. That followed a &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/wwfsecretwar"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that found that WWF-funded park rangers had been accused of murder, torture, and rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQtrxp"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund says the newly protected areas will help “secure” local communities’  rights to 24 million hectares of land. It’s also spending an additional $25 million to kick off a new kind of “global mechanism” that could secure “support” for Indigenous peoples and local communities. Forests have tended to fare better under their care, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/6/3015"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows. There’s also an additional $51 million to restore landscapes in the US and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAFkTp"&gt;Closer to home for Bezos, Amazon was implicated in a recent report as playing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808388/amazon-target-port-congestion-pollution-maritime-shipping"&gt;“outsized” role&lt;/a&gt; in port congestion and associated shipping pollution along the west coast of the US. And despite Amazon’s commitments to address climate change, the company’s carbon footprint &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/amazon-says-carbon-emissions-rose-19percent-in-2020.html"&gt;grew by nearly 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/pdfBuilderDownload?name=amazon-sustainability-2020-report"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony cameras are getting harder to buy due to the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1XqwCIWZ8cTMFa_NikQZqRAsbS8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237015/bfarsace_290921_4781_01963.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Ve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmWJZ6"&gt;The global chip shortage has claimed yet another camera from Sony’s lineup. This time, Sony is suspending orders for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702421/sony-alpha-zv-e10-review-vlogging-camera-test-price-specs"&gt;ZV-E10, a mirrorless vlogging camera&lt;/a&gt; that the company released in August, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/3172922224/another-one-bites-the-dust-sony-suspends-orders-of-its-zv-e10-camera-citing-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Photography Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vohSjp"&gt;Sony announced the camera’s suspension in a post &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20211203.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it will no longer sell the ZV-E10 on its store or through any of its distributors for the time being. “With regard to digital imaging products, parts procurement is delayed due to the effects of global semiconductor shortages,” a translation of Sony’s notice reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YkpVRL"&gt;Unfortunately, this is far from the only device that Sony has temporarily discontinued this year. In November, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20211119.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony stopped selling&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/30/7460095/sony-a7-ii-full-frame-camera-review"&gt;A7 II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266143/sony-a6400-review-mirrorless-compact-vlogging-camera"&gt;A6400&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836658/sony-a6600-a6100-camera-aps-c-mirrorless-price-specs-features"&gt;A1600&lt;/a&gt; series cameras, along with the ECM-B1M shotgun mic and PXW-Z190 camcorder. Sony also put the Handycam HDR-CX680 camcorder on hold &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20201203.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt;. The Sony A9 also &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/08/13/the-original-sony-alpha-9-appears-to-have-been-discontinued/"&gt;appears to be discontinued&lt;/a&gt; — or just in very short supply — as it’s listed as “No longer available” on both &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa9.html%3Futm_source%3Drflaid67085&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1333228-REG%2Fsony_ilce_9_b_alpha_a9_mirrorless_digital.html%3FfromDisList%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Go read this data analysis that uncovers predictive policing’s flawed algorithm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYcDD8kvfME-vk0me7AwZ69oKHs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236862/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmC131"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-we-determined-predictive-policing-software-dispropo-1848139456"&gt;released a deep-dive look&lt;/a&gt; into the data collection process behind &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-1848138977"&gt;its co-reported investigation with &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into PredPol, a software company specializing in predictive policing (hence the name, which it has since changed to Geolitica) through machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMG2zl"&gt;PredPol’s algorithm is supposed to make predictions based on existing crime reports. However, since crimes aren’t equally reported everywhere, the readings it provides to law enforcement could simply copy the biases in reporting over each area. If police use this to decide where to patrol, they could end up over-policing areas that don’t need a larger presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lekE1l"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;evaluated the areas, they found that the places PredPol’s software targeted for increased patrols “were more likely to be home to Blacks, Latinos, and families that would qualify for the federal free and reduced lunch program.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0qWNhi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;23 of the 38 law enforcement agencies tracked are no longer PredPol customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nOUYix"&gt;Even as police tactics evolved to include crime and arrest data, there has been a historical disparity in how these tactics affect communities of color. As &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out in its analysis, in New York in the 1990s, researchers at the time found that the methods reduced crime without simply displacing it to other areas. However, the approach included tactics like stop-and-frisk, which have been criticized as violations of civil rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMJFmY"&gt;PredPol’s algorithm &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwbag4/academics-confirm-major-predictive-policing-algorithm-is-fundamentally-flawed"&gt;has already been looked into&lt;/a&gt; and criticized by academics more than once. As &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;quoted Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a member of the board of directors for ACLU Utah, in 2019: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="21ByOF"&gt;“Because this data is collected as a by-product of police activity, predictions made on the basis of patterns learned from this data do not pertain to future instances of crime on the whole,” Venkatasubramanian’s study notes. “In this sense, predictive policing is aptly named: it is predicting future policing, not future crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pyKzAm"&gt;Still, there hasn’t been an investigation as thorough as this one. This investigation used figures retrieved from public data available via the web. According to &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, they found an unsecured cloud database linked from the Los Angeles Police Department’s website. That data contained millions of predictions stretching back several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fwBgP"&gt;Besides supposedly predicting individual crimes, a 2018 report by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17285058/predictive-policing-predpol-pentagon-ai-racial-bias"&gt;looked into  Pentagon-funded research by PredPol’s founder Jeff Brantingham about using the software to predict gang-related crime&lt;/a&gt;. The former University of California-Los Angeles anthropology professor adapted earlier research in forecasting battlefield casualties in Iraq to create the platform, and the paper — “Partially Generative Neural Networks for Gang Crime Classification with Partial Information” — raised concern over the ethical implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acDZjQ"&gt;Critics said this approach could do more harm than good. “You’re making algorithms off a false narrative that’s been created for people — the gang documentation thing is the state defining people according to what they believe ... When you plug this into the computer, every crime is gonna be gang-related,” activist Aaron Harvey told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo8lG7"&gt;Relying on some algorithms can work magic for some industries, but their impact can come at a real human cost. With bad data or the wrong parameters, things can go wrong quickly, even in circumstances that are less fraught than policing.  Look no further than Zillow recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760080/zillow-offers-home-selling-ibuyer-wind-down-excess-inventory-losses-financial-results"&gt;having to shut down&lt;/a&gt; its house-flipping operation after losing hundreds of millions of dollars despite the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758176/zillow-offers-ibuyer-housing-market-inventory-investors-real-estate"&gt;pricing models and automation&lt;/a&gt;” it thought would provide an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPZufv"&gt;Overall, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-1848138977"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting&lt;/a&gt; is a good consideration of how significantly predictive algorithms can affect the people unknowingly targeted by them. The &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-we-determined-predictive-policing-software-dispropo-1848139456"&gt;accompanying analysis&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; provides relevant data insight while giving readers a behind-the-scenes look into these measures. The report indicates that 23 of the 38 law enforcement agencies tracked are no longer PredPol customers, despite initially signing up for it to help distribute crime-stopping resources. Perhaps by using methods that build transparency and trust on both sides, law enforcement could spend less time on tech that leads to pieces like this, which highlights the exact opposite approach. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Playstation 5 will be available for Walmart Plus members on Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the disc-based model and the Digital Edition will be available.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n38PYV"&gt;Ready. Steady. Go. If you’re still looking for a PlayStation 5, Walmart Plus members will be able to queue up for the console beginning at 12PM EST on Wednesday, December 8th. Walmart will open the digital queue for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard Playstation 5 ($500&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-less, digital-only version ($400)&lt;/a&gt;. This paywall doesn’t necessarily improve your chances of snagging a console but is currently the only way to be in the running at this particular retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjPdLk"&gt;You have to be logged into your Walmart Plus account to even attempt to add a Playstation 5 to your cart, so if you haven’t done so already, make sure you log in ahead of time and have your credentials saved to keep things moving along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lICTr"&gt;If you aren’t already a Walmart Plus member, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%2Fplans%3Fdirect%3Dtrue%26returnurl%3D%25252Fip%25252FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%25252F987823383" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll need to sign up for this $13 / month subscription service&lt;/a&gt; in order to be eligible for this restock. Unfortunately, you can’t simply exploit the 15-day free trial it offers, but subscribing to the service will make you eligible for benefits like free shipping and early access to sales and restock events.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta has a ‘moral obligation’ to make its mental health research transparent, scientists say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hOeIVsv7vTIwmRWYzzXl6WFQ8Ls=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236696/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sNwlP"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/an-open-letter-to-mark-zuckerberg/"&gt;an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; published Monday, a group of academics called for Meta to be more transparent about its research into how Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp affect the mental health of children and adolescents. The letter calls for the company to allow independent reviews of its internal work, contribute data to external research projects, and set up an independent scientific oversight group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfpCYB"&gt;“You and your organizations have an ethical and moral obligation to align your internal research on children and adolescents with established standards for evidence in mental health science,” the letter, signed by researchers from universities around the world, reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQddkI"&gt;The open letter comes after leaks from Facebook revealed some data from the company’s internal research, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; Instagram was linked with anxiety and body image issues for some teenage girls. The research released, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749357/facebook-mental-health-research-tobacco"&gt;is limited&lt;/a&gt; and relied on subjective information collected through interviews. While this strategy can produce useful insights, it can’t prove that social media caused any of the mental health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICdkZu"&gt;The information available so far appears to show that the studies Facebook researchers conducted&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;don’t meet the standards academic researchers use to conduct trials, the new open letter said. The information available also isn’t complete, the authors noted — Meta hasn’t made its research methods or data public, so it can’t be scrutinized by independent experts. The authors called for the company to allow independent review of past and future research, which would include releasing research materials and data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz9GMw"&gt;The letter also asked Meta to contribute its data to ongoing independent research efforts on the mental health of adolescents. It’s a longstanding frustration that big tech companies don’t release data, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594178/apple-watch-data-research-heart-rate-reliability"&gt;makes it&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; for external researchers to scrutinize and understand their products. “It will be impossible to identify and promote mental health in the 21st century if we cannot study how young people are interacting online,” the authors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gO1JM"&gt;The company likely has the data on platform usage and other user behavior to show the ways its platforms do or do not affect the mental health of kids and teens, Kaveri Subrahmanyam, a developmental psychologist at California State University, Los Angeles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749357/facebook-mental-health-research-tobacco"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this fall&lt;/a&gt;.  “Why are they not releasing the data that they have that shows the clicks and other behavior? I think they should be inviting researchers who have that expertise, and giving them that data and letting them do that analysis,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDgw75"&gt;The open letter also called on Meta to establish an independent scientific trust to evaluate any risks to mental health from the use of platforms like Facebook and Instagram and to help implement “truly evidence-based solutions for online risks on a world-wide scale.” The trust could be similar to the existing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;Facebook Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the company with content moderation decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQsP37"&gt;Internal research available from Meta at this point cannot conclusively say if or how social media platforms affect mental health, but the leaked findings — coupled with other research on social media — raise enough concerning issues to warrant further investigation through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749357/facebook-mental-health-research-tobacco"&gt;more rigorous research&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help understand the relationship. Understanding how life online affects kids and teenagers is a critical question, the authors of the open letter note. But the secrecy with which Meta has navigated research so far has “somewhat predictably” engendered skepticism from the research community, which prioritizes transparency, and left other stakeholders (like lawmakers and parents) concerned, the authors of the open letter wrote. Taking the steps the authors outline could help clear up those issues and contribute to a more complete picture of mental health online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy6zrD"&gt;“If the right scientific and ethical tools were in place, data collected by Meta could inform how we understand digital technology use and its influence on mental health in unprecedented ways,” the letter reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4MIXa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJkVsg"&gt;TikTok’s much-vaunted video algorithm is designed around two things: getting users to stick around and getting users to come back. That’s according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/media/tiktok-algorithm.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;a report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reviewed a leaked copy of an internal TikTok document summarizing how the system works. The report offers a rare look into one of the most discussed algorithms in tech right now, and it reveals some considerations — like retaining creators and ensuring they make money — that may not be obvious choices when building a video feed meant to keep viewers tuned in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkoFl1"&gt;To keep users watching and coming back, TikTok considers four main objectives, according to the&lt;em&gt; Times: &lt;/em&gt;user value, long-term user value, creator value, and platform value. One way that plays out is the algorithm prioritizing a diversity of content rather than overwhelming users with one single topic they might love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqv9JF"&gt;“If a user likes a certain kind of video, but the app continues to push the same kind to him, he would quickly get bored and close the app,” the document reads, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. To avoid that, the app might show a “forced recommendation” to present something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1fNPN1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The leaker was concerned with videos leading to self-harm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RuvyFI"&gt;The document presents what is supposed to be a simplified version of TikTok’s formula for what people like and what it should play. It roughly breaks down to a combination of likes, comments, watch time on a video, and whether a video was played, according to the report. There are some variables in the equation that aren’t spelled out, but my read on it is that TikTok likely weights different interactions so that some are valued more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4gpGR"&gt;TikTok also puts a real focus on creators when judging the value of its For You feed, according to a flow chart from the document that was recreated by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. It shows TikTok considering “creation quality,” which is judged by publish rate, creator retention, and creator monetization. There isn’t further detail on how TikTok judges creator retention and monetization, but it would appear to indicate that whether creators are successful is a real consideration when determining the “quality of videos” in the For You feed. That said, whether creators make money isn’t an input to the algorithm, TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Instead, it’s an outcome of TikTok’s optimization for user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqrpqh"&gt;For its part, TikTok has not been entirely opaque about all of this in the past. In blog posts, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296044/tiktok-for-you-page-algorithm-sides-engagement-data-creators-trends-sounds"&gt;detailed the basics&lt;/a&gt; of how its feed works — comments and what accounts you follow can impact recommendations — and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/11/21430822/tiktok-transparency-visit-tour-algorithms-for-you-page"&gt;gave &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;a look inside&lt;/a&gt; its “Transparency and Accountability Center” last year, which spoke to the company’s concerns about issues like filter bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpPFks"&gt;Today’s report shouldn’t dispel concerns about filter bubbles or the app driving users toward problematic content. In fact, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;says the document was leaked by a TikTok employee who was concerned about the app leading to self-harm. In the past, reporters have spotted the app presenting user-generated content &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cameronwilson/tiktok-eating-disorder-videos-algorithm-for-you-page"&gt;promoting eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.huckmag.com/perspectives/tiktokers-are-using-secret-hashtags-to-discuss-self-harm/"&gt;discussing or&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mic.com/life/people-are-cutting-themselves-on-tiktok-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it-81163126"&gt;showing self-harm&lt;/a&gt;. Because the app is so finely tuned at keeping users tuned in with content similar to videos they’ve already watched, it’s easy to see how quickly the network could become problematic if not properly moderated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIGpHi"&gt;Favazza says TikTok considers “a range of engagement signals” when determining what to show people. “We continue to invest in new ways to customize content preferences, automatically skip videos that aren’t relevant or age-appropriate, and remove violations of our Community Guidelines,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFaw9K"&gt;Mostly, though, the leak provides a fascinating insight into one of the most-discussed black boxes on the internet — how TikTok decides what to show you video after video. The details presented here, like the recommendation formula, are “highly simplified,” the document says. But it indicates that the complicated ways major social platforms craft their algorithms could be broken down into clear objectives and shared with the public to provide at least some sense of why we’re seeing whatever it is we see.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bql2JV"&gt;Toyota will build a $1.29 billion battery factory in North Carolina in an effort to bring some of its electric vehicle supply chain to the US. The news comes on the heels of Toyota’s announcement that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662236/toyota-battery-investment-electric-cars-hybrids-2030"&gt;invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech&lt;/a&gt; over the next decade, including a $9 billion investment in production, as it attempts to electrify its vehicle lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="encq9M"&gt;Toyota plans on spreading the $1.29 billion for the new factory over the next decade, but production at the facility is scheduled to begin in 2025, said Chris Reynolds, chief administrative officer for Toyota Motor North America. In the first year, Toyota plans on producing 1.2 million battery packs for its upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, Reynolds said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dCNjOu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota has said it will create 1,750 new jobs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOxx2t"&gt;“This investment, which I believe is so far the largest private capital investment in North Carolina history... will create at least 1,750 new jobs and help us develop and localize automotive battery production,” Reynolds said during a press conference, “which will pave the way for battery electric vehicles built here in the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcdh9a"&gt;The factory won’t come without its costs to the taxpayers. &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article256372267.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina’s Economic Investment Committee approved a $438.7 million tax incentive package to encourage Toyota to build in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c28VTd"&gt;Toyota’s battery factory is the latest new facility planned as car companies scramble to ramp up production of EVs. Toyota’s first long-range EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752539/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-steering-yoke-solar-roof"&gt;the BZ4X compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to be released in mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0WCjP"&gt;Ford and South Korean battery manufacturer SK Innovation are spending $11.4 billion on several new factories in Tennessee and Kentucky, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is planning four new battery factories in the US with partner LG Chem. In Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to have six battery cell production plants operating by 2030. And Tesla is close to finishing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;battery factory in Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, which would produce 250GWh — roughly equivalent to the current world battery cell production capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHhOwU"&gt;Globally, battery production is expected to grow from 95.3GWh in 2020 to 410.5GWh in 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhlLN7"&gt;The news is also set against the backdrop of fierce lobbying in Washington, DC, over the future of the federal EV tax credit, which currently provides shaves $7,500 off the purchase price of some electric vehicles. Congressional Democrats have proposed increasing the credit to $12,500 for purchases of electric vehicles made in the US by unionized workers, triggering a backlash from non-union companies like Tesla and Toyota. The Japanese automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qll6xa/toyota_full_page_ad_in_the_wsj_screams_antiunion/"&gt;run full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; accusing President Joe Biden and the Democrats of “play[ing] politics with the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoE9SY"&gt;Although the company was an early leader in gas-electric hybrid cars with the Prius, Toyota reportedly viewed hybrids as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toyota-whiffed-on-electric-vehicles-now-trying-slow-their-rise/"&gt;stopgap measure&lt;/a&gt; until hydrogen fuel cells became competitive. Now, the company is playing catch-up with the likes of Nissan and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594235/toyota-lobbying-dc-ev-congress-biden-donation"&gt;reportedly lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to slow the US’s transition to electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MlTPA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
