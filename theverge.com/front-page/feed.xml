    <title>Bird plans a pilot program for electric wheelchair and mobility scooter rentals in NYC this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGILDhJCgI1Sa3-7QZzbyIiyAt8=/65x0:959x596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537788/bird_scootaround_offer_on_demand_accessible_mobility_cities_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bird is piloting a mobility scooter rental program in New York City | Bird&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGcP7E"&gt;Scooter company Bird is partnering with mobility vehicle company Scootaround on a pilot program that will test accessible electric vehicle rentals in New York City this summer, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-scootaround-offer-on-demand-accessible-mobility-cities/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. A new button in Bird’s main app will let people with mobility issues choose one of three different models to rent, including three- and four-wheel scooters and the Whill Model Ci2 power wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYn2EW"&gt;Once the rider chooses a vehicle, they pick a rental length between one and 14 days. Riders will get an in-person tutorial the day of their rental to ensure they’re comfortable using, charging, and storing the vehicle. Bird has a toll-free number for questions about the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuY2qJ"&gt;“As micromobility options such as shared bikes and scooters continue to expand, we must ensure the benefits of these improved transportation networks be made as widely available as possible, including to persons with disabilities,” Kerry Renaud, CEO of Scootaround said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVeNCG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204232/new-york-legalizes-electric-bikes-scooters"&gt;New York State lifted its ban&lt;/a&gt; on electric scooters in 2020, and the city Department of Transportation announced Bird, Lime, and VeoRide would be part of its e-scooter pilot in the Bronx this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ONzBn"&gt;Bird plans to roll out the partnership with Scootaround to more cities later this year, based on the results of the NYC pilot. &lt;/p&gt;

Better yet, the retailer says these are “Grade A” units, which means they won’t have anything more than minimal cosmetic wear. These work on GSM and CDMA carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRtKhB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Boring Company pitches underground transit loop to Fort Lauderdale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk’s Boring Company Demonstrates Transport Tunnel Underneath Las Vegas Convention Center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mY19EtN00dGVy-Pmt20s0DtXS1c=/8x0:5402x3596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69537632/1311709601.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ROtoYc"&gt;The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunneling venture, pitched an underground transit system to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the town’s mayor said in a tweet. It’s the latest city to become transfixed by Musk’s quixotic “Tesla in a tunnel” concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoPnEx"&gt;It’s not a done deal, but Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis called it “an innovative and unprecedented approach to addressing traffic congestion and transit needs.” Trantalis said the project, which would be called the “Las Ollas Loop,” would connect Fort Lauderdale’s downtown to the beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qh5FHB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fort Lauderdale has received a proposal from Elon Musk's The Boring Co. to build an underground transit loop between downtown and the beach. Called “The Las Olas Loop,” this represents an innovative and unprecedented approach to addressing traffic congestion and transit needs.&lt;/p&gt;— Mayor Dean J. Trantalis (@DeanTrantalis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DeanTrantalis/status/1410317226327121921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5sQa5"&gt;To be sure, the Boring Company has only dug three tunnels — a test tunnel in Los Angeles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455365/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-test-lvcc-loop-teslas"&gt;two 0.8-mile tunnels underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a href="https://archive.curbed.com/2020/1/8/21046929/elon-musk-ces-vegas-boring-company"&gt;has yet to be proven out as a functional transit system&lt;/a&gt;. Musk’s early idea of an underground transit system for high-frequency autonomous electric “sleds” capable of carrying dozens of people has been scrapped in favor of a system that can only accommodate individual Tesla vehicles. And industry experts have cast Musk’s efforts as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/urban-tunnels-musk-s-boring-co-draw-industry-skepticism-n1269677"&gt;little more than “hot air.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EZI5AC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be sure, the Boring Company has only dug three tunnels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NlMUpE"&gt;Nonetheless, Musk has managed to impress a handful of city officials with his concept Teslas ferrying passengers through neon-lit tunnels. In addition to Fort Lauderdale, the Boring Company has also proposed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269188/elon-musk-boring-company-miami-tunnel-mayor-francis-suarez"&gt;$30 million loop system in Miami&lt;/a&gt;. Previous projects, such as a proposed 35-mile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18507839/elon-musk-boring-company-dc-baltimore-hyperloop-report"&gt;Washington, DC-to-Baltimore tunnel&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18256604/elon-musk-chicago-mayor-election-tunnel-high-speed-transit"&gt;Chicago loop system&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be canceled. (The DC-to-Baltimore project has disappeared from the company’s website.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEq6JH"&gt;According to the city, the Boring Company reached out earlier this year to “discuss underground alternatives to the construction of a high-rise commuter rail bridge over the New River.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gaiaov"&gt;“The underground transit loop would provide quicker and more efficient access between downtown and the beach as well as alleviate street-level traffic,” the city said &lt;a href="https://www.fortlauderdale.gov/Home/Components/News/News/5887/16?backlist=%2fhome"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qE4gn7"&gt;More details about the Fort Lauderdale proposal, such as the length of the tunnel and the total cost, are still unknown. The city says that state law prohibits the release of the specifics of the plan until the competitive process is concluded. The City Commission is scheduled to vote on whether to accept the proposal on July 2nd, during which other firms can come forward with competing ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Police ticket driver for sticking Starlink terminal on car’s hood</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S3WZ4sTNw8g9HiPsHijoSWVuV40=/0x0:960x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69536149/201511914_4704883842896338_5865721692059119911_n.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;California Highway Patrol&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Z9ZDi"&gt;A California Highway Patrol officer stopped a Toyota Prius on Friday that had what looks like a Starlink dish fastened to its hood, the agency said in a Facebook post. The “visual obstruction,” sitting right smack in the middle of the car’s hood, landed the driver a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnTvb4"&gt;“Sir I stopped you today for that visual obstruction on your hood. Does it not block your view while driving?” an officer said, quoted in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CHPAntelopeValley/posts/4704883919562997"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on CHP Antelope Valley’s Facebook page. The driver replied: “Only when I make right turns...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3r0DQg"&gt;The driver told the CHP officer that they were using the antenna to have Wi-Fi for a business they run out of their car, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/chp-tickets-driver-with-apparent-spacex-starlink-dish-on-hood.html"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported on the traffic stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVzez1"&gt;“Yes, it is in fact illegal to mount a satellite dish to the hood of your vehicle,” CHP’s Facebook post continued, citing a state law that bars other view-obstructions like objects hanging from a rear-view mirror, or poorly positioned GPS mounts. “It’s about safety folks. These are the real stories of the Highway Patrol. Safe travels everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qEt8fj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elon Musk: “Technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9kGR2s"&gt;Starlink, SpaceX’s fast-growing broadband internet service, is in the midst of an open beta period with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556031/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-users-next-year-telecom-5g"&gt;over 70,000 users&lt;/a&gt; across 12 countries, according to its CEO Elon Musk. Many individual users are paying $99 per month for internet under that beta, using a $499 bundle of a self-aligning, large pizza-sized Starlink dish and Wi-Fi router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa1X1q"&gt;SpaceX doesn’t have FCC approval to mount consumer Starlink terminals on moving vehicles yet, but the company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319761/spacex-starlink-fcc-internet-cars-boats-aircraft"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; such capabilities for months — mainly for commercial use-cases like shipping vessels, large trucks and passenger airplanes. Musk has said Starlink antennas, as currently designed, would be too powerful for individual cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvx9V9"&gt;“The antenna for that high-bandwidth, low-latency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on a car, but I think is more bandwidth than you would really need,” Musk said during a January 2020 earnings call. “Technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g7QMEh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp;amp; RVs.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1369051431903268865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>REvil ransomware attacks systems using Kaseya’s remote IT management software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncWJdH"&gt;Just in time to ruin the holiday weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware attackers&lt;/a&gt; have apparently used Kaseya — a software platform designed to help manage IT services remotely — to deliver their payload. Sophos director and ethical hacker Mark Loman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markloman/status/1411035534554808331"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the attack earlier today, and now reports that affected systems will demand $44,999 to be unlocked. A note on Kaseya’s website implores customers to shut off their VSA servers for now “because one of the first things the attacker does is shutoff administrative access to the VSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iiPDUk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;News Flash: cybercriminals are a$$holes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep all the Incident Response teams in mind this holiday weekend as they're in the thick of it...again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you use Kaseya VSA, shut it down *now* until told to reactivate and initiate IR. Here's the binary: &lt;a href="https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p"&gt;https://t.co/NIuGJZW84p&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt"&gt;https://t.co/GSXPlOPjFt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1411046946349924359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2vfPv"&gt;According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-hits-200-companies-in-msp-supply-chain-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the attack targeted six large MSPs and has encrypted data for as many as 200 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xaRdz"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://doublepulsar.com/kaseya-supply-chain-attack-delivers-mass-ransomware-event-to-us-companies-76e4ec6ec64b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DoublePulsar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Beaumont has posted more details about how the attack seems to work, with REvil ransomware arriving via a Kaseya update and using the platform’s administrative privileges to infect systems. Once the Managed Service Providers are infected, their systems can attack the clients that they provide remote IT services for (network management, system updates, and backups, among other things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHOwjZ"&gt;In a statement, Kaseya told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “We are investigating a potential attack against the VSA that indicates to have been limited to a small number of our on-premises customers only.” A notice claims that all of its cloud servers are now in “maintenance mode,” a move that the spokesperson said is being taken due to an “abundance of caution.”  Later on Friday evening, Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola issued a statement saying they estimate the number of MSPs affected is fewer than 40, and are preparing a patch to mitigate the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4kS3K"&gt;Today’s attack has been linked to the notorious REvil ransomware gang (already linked to attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;meat supplier JBS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year), and &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/revil-ransomware-executes-supply-chain-attack-via-malicious-kaseya-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that, collecting incidents under more than one name, this may be the third time Kaseya software has been a vector for their exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="M8ctSW"&gt;Beginning around mid-day (EST/US) on Friday July 2, 2021, Kaseya’s Incident Response team learned of a potential security incident involving our VSA software.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwmwEl"&gt;We took swift actions to protect our customers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3Otiv"&gt;Immediately shut down our SaaS servers as a precautionary measure, even though we had not received any reports of compromise from any SaaS or hosted customers; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AT3dXo"&gt;Immediately notified our on-premises customers via email, in-product notices, and phone to shut down their VSA servers to prevent them from being compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdJWl6"&gt;We then followed our established incident response process to determine the scope of the incident and the extent that our customers were affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWL5Ga"&gt;We engaged our internal incident response team and leading industry experts in forensic investigations to help us determine the root cause of the issue; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxdwRe"&gt;We notified law enforcement and government cybersecurity agencies, including the FBI and CISA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y03Cfa"&gt;While our early indicators suggested that only a very small number of on-premises customers were affected, we took a conservative approach in shutting down the SaaS servers to ensure we protected our more than 36,000 customers to the best of our ability.  We have received positive feedback from our customers on our rapid and proactive response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOLmF2"&gt;While our investigation is ongoing, to date we believe that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jU4Yma"&gt;Our SaaS customers were never at-risk. We expect to restore service to those customers once we have confirmed that they are not at risk, which we expect will be within the next 24 hours; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovkuQe"&gt;Only a very small percentage of our customers were affected – currently estimated at fewer than 40 worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxTYEH"&gt;We believe that we have identified the source of the vulnerability and are preparing a patch to mitigate it for our on-premises customers that will be tested thoroughly. We will release that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfks5x"&gt;I am proud to report that our team had a plan in place to jump into action and executed that plan perfectly today. We’ve heard from the vast majority of our customers that they experienced no issues at all, and I am grateful to our internal teams, outside experts, and industry partners who worked alongside of us to quickly bring this to a successful outcome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd7BaW"&gt;Today’s actions are a testament to Kaseya’s unwavering commitment to put our customers first and provide the highest level of support for our products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVLTxS"&gt;— Fred Voccola, CEO of Kaseya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gtbSuB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 2nd, 10:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Kaseya CEO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony makes clear it will still sell PSP games on the PS3 and Vita stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="psp 3000 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nEoRAqrBwVN4CkG490I9gt2x-E4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69536044/DSCF5387.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qXCone"&gt;In March, Sony received widespread backlash for announcing plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356791/sony-playstation-store-close-ps3-vita-psp-game-downloads"&gt;to shut down the PS3 and Vita stores&lt;/a&gt; and remove the ability to purchase PSP games from both storefronts. The criticism led Sony to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392126/sony-ps3-ps-vita-stores-open-backtrack-psp-july-2nd-mistake"&gt;reverse course in part&lt;/a&gt;, promising to keep the PS3 and Vita stores open, but the company stayed committed to ending “PSP commerce functionality” on July 2nd. While it was unclear exactly what that meant at the time, Sony has shed a little more light on the situation: you’ll still be able to buy new PSP games on the PS3 and Vita stores, but you won’t be able to buy new DLC, according to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/important-notice/"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/important-notice/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; support pages (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-will-keep-selling-psp-games-after-all-1847215665"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmFeqe"&gt;Here are the three new updates Sony made to clarify things, including that it will remove the ability to make searches or download DLC from the PSP store on July 6th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sCQXRe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pvwCi"&gt;When the PlayStation®Store for PlayStation®Portable (PSP) was previously closed in 2016, you were still able to perform searches and make in-game purchases. Starting July 6th, 2021, you’ll no longer be able to perform searches or make in-game purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNVTXp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about PSP content that you already own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEGwlE"&gt;You’ll still be able to download your previously purchased PSP content. You can download your previously purchased PSP content onto your PSP by accessing the Download List on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vFHuc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about PSP content that is available for purchase on the PS3 and PS Vita stores?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm4Ais"&gt;You’ll still be able to purchase and play PSP content that is available on the PS3 and PS Vita stores. However, you’ll no longer be able to make purchases via the in-game store for PSP content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xwKtyB"&gt;All of this naturally only applies to games that were sold digitally, but it helps preserve some of the PSP’s history and back catalog, since &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwignZaFjsXxAhVsnWoFHaGcAf4QFnoECAUQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2016%2F2%2F29%2F11135200%2Fsony-shutting-down-psp-store&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw24MH2mb4ltvPAMcI99Hq-D"&gt;the native PSP storefront shutdown in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ekYN5"&gt;In comparison to Microsoft, which uses backwards compatibility across multiple generations as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150594/microsoft-xbox-series-x-backwards-compatibility-support-smart-delivery"&gt;major selling point for the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, playing older games on Sony’s consoles can often be a bit more complicated than just popping in an old disc. The Playstation 5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21509379/sony-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-games-support-features"&gt;currently plays most Playstation 4 games&lt;/a&gt;, but if you want to play games from older generations on Sony’s newest console, you’ll need to pony up for a Playstation Now subscription, which lets you play Playstation 3 and Playstation 2 games streamed from the cloud, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;buy full price remakes of the classics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJBxut"&gt;For the PSP, there’s still a feasible way to buy games for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20991654/psp-vita-portable-playstation-console-sony-25-anniversary"&gt;the beloved handheld&lt;/a&gt;, at least for now — even it means purchasing the games from one of two stores on entirely different hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another day, another WD security flaw</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wdUGFo9tjQf9jyb0TmO1dix6reE=/378x43:2522x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69536032/Screen_Shot_2021_07_02_at_12.59.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: WD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8nTzMb"&gt;After a security vulnerability led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549677/wd-my-book-live-data-deletion-unplug-lan-cable-threat-actor"&gt;some WD NAS owners having their data wiped&lt;/a&gt;, a new vulnerability has been discovered in more of WD’s devices (&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The vulnerability, discovered by security researchers Pedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski, is seemingly present on Cloud OS 3 devices and not on the newer Cloud OS 5, which WD recently released as an update. The problem is that, according to Ribeiro and Domanski, many of WD’s users don’t like the new version. That’s because it’s missing certain functions and features &lt;a href="https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29389"&gt;that were available in Cloud OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F2%2F22561140%2Fwd-cloud-os-3-security-flaw-update-patch-disconnect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD has said&lt;/a&gt; it won’t be updating Cloud OS 3 with security patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PG4dA"&gt;There’s also the possibility that some users won’t be able to upgrade to Cloud OS 5. According to &lt;a href="https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29230"&gt;WD’s supported devices page&lt;/a&gt;, the updated software isn’t available for the MyCloud EX2, EX4, or certain versions of the My Cloud and My Cloud Mirror. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ6vWe"&gt;If you own a device that can’t be updated to Cloud OS 5, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F2%2F22561140%2Fwd-cloud-os-3-security-flaw-update-patch-disconnect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD’s advice&lt;/a&gt; is to upgrade to one that can. The other option, according to a statement WD &lt;a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/security-vulnerabilities-80000-devices-update-now/"&gt;gave to &lt;em&gt;Comparitech&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, is to turn off remote dashboard access to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ANtXb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A hacker could potentially brick your NAS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gLRCMV"&gt;The researchers found that they could get into a Cloud OS 3 device by remotely updating it with modified firmware. The firmware update functionality is meant to be accessible only to authenticated users, but they were able to get around that because the NAS seemingly has a user on it with a blank password, which they were able to use to authenticate in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYPj6A"&gt;Their version of the exploit allows them to carry out commands on the NAS, but other versions could be used for any number of nefarious purposes. Also, because the hack exploits the firmware update function, a hacker could purposefully or even accidentally brick the device. The researchers have built their own custom security patch, but it has to be re-applied to the device every time it reboots. You can see more details about it in a video they made explaining the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EcVbtb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsg9YgvGBec?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CCVqTf"&gt;While the vulnerability found by the researchers seems especially egregious, it may not be the only one out there — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fsupport%2Fproductsecurity%2Fwdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F2%2F22561140%2Fwd-cloud-os-3-security-flaw-update-patch-disconnect" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD’s post&lt;/a&gt; recommending people upgrade to Cloud OS 5 says that it defends against entire classes of attacks. With that in mind, if you own a device that can’t run the new OS, it’s probably time to think about an upgrade, either to one of WD’s new devices, or to another NAS option.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock premier tiers will stream the 2021 Stanley Cup games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWIS8Zg-T-kOOUnLI6Enhl9s4NQ=/49x0:951x601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535991/peacock.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ylF484"&gt;NBCUniversal’s streaming service Peacock will stream every remaining 2021 Stanley Cup Final match, just as the service’s parent company will stream the games on broadcast NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7po7Ii"&gt;The service &lt;a href="https://viewer.mediafly.com/mediavillage/interactive/2929fed4187b40648b79a9839e70e91fproduct169208/index.html#/brand/ddfffeac-5bfe-497f-9bfb-d359535d0079/press-releases/75874562-4b64-4c7a-a695-acbd99021cdb"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that the matches would kick off with a stream of Game 3 between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Montreal Canadiens. The streaming coverage will cover up to five games and will be available through Peacock’s premium tiers, which cost $5 per month with ads or $10 per month to go ad-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNtZCA"&gt;The announcement marks a noticeable push by NBCUniversal to round out the sports programming on its marquee streaming service. In addition to coverage of Tour de France and Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, among other sporting events, the service is also the exclusive home of WWE Network events, including the forthcoming SummerSlam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnHXEw"&gt;Peacock may be the scrappy little guy in the room, but it’s sure offering a lot more niche sports coverage than many of its contemporaries. Your move, Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0mltVZY3kM-rUP2rOcALXXWqBM=/26x0:455x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535459/ca_mwc.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7p0LX3"&gt;Qualcomm’s new CEO, Cristiano Amon, has big plans for competing with Apple when it comes to laptop performance, thanks to the ex-Apple employees Qualcomm brought on when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;it acquired Nuvia earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes Qualcomm could make the world’s best processor, which would require designing a chip better than Apple’s M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbyn8"&gt;Before assuming his new role as CEO, Amon was head of Qualcomm’s semiconductor division and was in charge of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;acquisition of Nuvia for $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. The startup was founded by three former Apple engineers who specialized in chip design and worked on Apple’s A-series SOCs. Those founders joined Qualcomm, and it’s apparent now that they’ll be focusing on making chips for consumer computers (though the company wouldn’t turn down the chance to license its tech to data centers, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;). Qualcomm hopes to start selling Arm laptop chips, powered by Nuvia’s designs, next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jm3rlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t added 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, to its M1 Macs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soFLVj"&gt;Amon also hopes to use the company’s experience in making 5G chips and smartphone processors to help provide a better laptop experience, by building 5G connectivity into its laptop-focused CPUs. Adding 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, is something that Apple hasn’t done yet for its M1 Macs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-and-pro-with-m1-opens-the-door-to-5g-it-cant-come-soon-enough/"&gt;despite demand from some&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pro has a 5G option&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NehvPD"&gt;It’s safe to say that if Qualcomm wants to become a dominant player in powering laptops like it is in the smartphone market, it has a lot of work to do. While Microsoft does use Qualcomm-designed chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496677/microsoft-surface-pro-x-refresh-sq2-processor-new-platinum-color-option"&gt;in its Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; (which made an appearance at the Windows 11 event), the list of &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile-computing/mobile-pcs"&gt;Windows PCs with Qualcomm inside&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a long one. It’s also unlikely that Intel is planning on just letting Arm take over the laptop space without a fight — the &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake"&gt;company is working on hybrid CPUs&lt;/a&gt; that, like Arm, mix high-power and efficiency-focused cores to provide better battery life, but using an x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxBCE8"&gt;Amon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;also talked to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about challenges and opportunities the company faces due to sanctions in China and about the company’s struggles to become a household name like Intel or AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors is now being investigated by the Justice Department</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKpJHzbiCZ39IV6h6FcUidSJMcU=/375x0:1125x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535245/lordstown_news_antvm.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MMpocp"&gt;The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into troubled electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors, which is backed by General Motors and went public late last year but has yet to get its pickup — the Endurance — into production, according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the second official probe into the startup, as the Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;opened an investigation earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; into Lordstown Motors executives’ misleading claims about how many preorders it had logged for the Endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHzchr"&gt;The new investigation, which is being run by the US Attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York, comes just weeks after Lordstown Motors’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;CEO and founder was pushed out&lt;/a&gt; following a law firm’s probe into those misleading claims. The startup’s chief financial officer and other executives and personnel close to the founder were also let go at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pifWiw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Newly public EV startups are suddenly under intense scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KhjKvw"&gt;“Lordstown Motors is committed to cooperating with any regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries,” a representative for the startup said in a statement. “We look forward to closing this chapter so that our new leadership – and entire dedicated team – can focus solely on producing the first and best full-size all-electric pickup truck, the Lordstown Endurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cL8LLK"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what the Justice Department is examining, though SDNY often focuses on financial crimes and allegations of fraud. The DOJ is also investigating electric trucking startup Nikola, and the SEC has opened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;a probe into fellow EV startup Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. The press office for the SDNY did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsVnYI"&gt;Steve Burns, the founder, started Lordstown Motors in 2019 after leaving his previous startup, another electric vehicle company called Workhorse. He essentially founded Lordstown Motors in order to buy a recently shuttered plant in Lordstown, Ohio where GM once built the Chevy Cruze. GM also took a stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTrMB0"&gt;The purchase — and the startup itself — received praise from the Trump administration. Then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;said Lordstown Motors buying the factory&lt;/a&gt; was “GREAT NEWS” for the state, and later featured the startup at a White House event. Former Vice President Mike Pence even appeared at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;the Endurance reveal event&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQrnvs"&gt;Buying the GM factory was supposed to give Lordstown Motors an edge over other startups that are building their own factories. Burns also found one with the truck, too, as he licensed intellectual property for an electric pickup that Workhorse had developed but never put into production — a deal worth millions of dollars for his former company. &lt;/p&gt;

Afterward, Burns and the company touted that they had logged around 100,000 preorders for the Endurance in late 2020 and early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1paEuS"&gt;But in March, short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; that accused Lordstown Motors of, among other things, faking some of those preorders, and sourcing some to fleet brokerage firms that couldn’t afford the number of vehicles they were supposed to buy. Burns initially pushed back hard, saying “there’s always haters” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;quoting Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off” to a local news outlet&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;the company disclosed the SEC probe&lt;/a&gt; and launched its own review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUmOLw"&gt;In May, Lordstown Motors admitted that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;needed more money to survive&lt;/a&gt; and lowered the number of vehicles it hopes to produce by the end of 2021. It has also stopped work on its second vehicle, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt;an electric van&lt;/a&gt;, and said that it only has enough funding to last until May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vG9xT7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lordstown Motors raised $675 million in late 2020 but needs more cash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEoAfT"&gt;The review — conducted by a law firm with ties to Lordstown Motors — wrapped up in June. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;confirmed that Burns and others had made misleading claims about the preorders&lt;/a&gt;, and he resigned as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CJNo6"&gt;Lordstown Motors has since tapped another former Workhorse executive, Angela Strand, to serve as interim CEO. She is being paid $100,000 per month to serve in the role while the company hunts for a permanent replacement, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921085206/tm2119909d2_8k.htm"&gt;according to a recent filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
