    <title>NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZuAdEy"&gt;A new report finds that claims of anti-conservative bias on social media platforms are not only untrue but serve as a form of disinformation. The &lt;a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/bias-report-release-page"&gt;report from NYU’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; says not only is there no empirical finding that social media companies systematically suppress conservatives, but even reports of anecdotal instances tend to fall apart under close scrutiny. And in an effort to appear unbiased, platforms actually bend over backward to try to appease conservative critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtqBd"&gt;“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yetijO"&gt;The researchers analyzed data from analytics platforms CrowdTangle and NewsWhip and existing reports like the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/26/censorship-conservatives-social-media-432643"&gt;2020 study from Politico&lt;/a&gt; and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, all of which showed that conservative accounts actually dominated social media. And they drilled down into anecdotes about bias and repeatedly found there was no concrete evidence to support such claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceJWs8"&gt;Looking at how claims of anti-conservative bias developed over time, Barrett says, it’s not hard to see how the “anti-conservative” rhetoric became a political instrument. “It’s a tool used by everyone from Trump to Jim Jordan to Sean Hannity, but there is no evidence to back it up,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUG3Yf"&gt;The report notes that the many lawsuits against social media platforms have “failed to present substantial evidence of ideological favoritism — and they have all been dismissed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BEJlZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Twitter was taking the lead and setting the example.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFjffq"&gt;This is not to suggest that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and others have not made mistakes, Barrett added; they have. “They tend to react to crises and adjust their policies in the breach, and that’s led to a herky-jerky cadence of how they apply their policies,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6exNGz"&gt;Twitter in particular has historically been more hands-off with moderation, proud of its image as a protector of free speech. But all that changed in 2020, Barrett said, in response to the pandemic and the anticipation that there would be a bitter election campaign cycle. “Twitter shifted its policies and began much more vigorous policing of content around the pandemic and voting in general,” he notes. Among social media companies, “Twitter was taking the lead and setting the example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uK0jkY"&gt;And in the aftermath of the January 6th riots at the Capitol, Barrett says, Twitter and other platforms were well within their policies against inciting violence when they banned former President Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDGKY0"&gt;The report has several recommendations for social media platforms going forward. First: better disclosure around content moderation decisions, so the public has a fuller understanding of why certain content and users might be removed. The report authors also want platforms to allow users to customize and control their social media feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gf5IRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NVpfOZ"&gt;Hiring more human moderators is another key recommendation, and Barrett acknowledges that the job of content moderator is highly stressful. But having more moderators — hired as employees, not contractors — would allow Facebook and other platforms to spread out moderation of the most challenging content among more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2UsS6"&gt;The report also recommends Congress and the White House work with tech companies to dial back some of the hostility between Washington and Silicon Valley and work on responsible regulation. He doesn’t recommend repealing Section 230, however. Instead, he’d like to see it amended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWnhez"&gt;“Make it conditional: If companies want to enjoy the benefits of 230, they need to adopt responsible content moderation policies. Let people see how their algorithms work, and why certain people see material others don’t,” he said. “No one expects them to show every last line of code, but people should be able to understand what goes into the decisions being made about what they’re seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjP1rB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e81ZDm"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This DIY project turns an iPod into a click wheel-powered Spotify player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY1430B9FKY0A7KtQXj_959cF0c=/0x6:2995x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753287/9709381611420439726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Guy Dupont&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23TvnZ"&gt;Classic iPods have their fans, but they’re not built for the modern age of music streaming — except for this one, which has been turned into a Spotify player by tinkerer Guy Dupont. While it may look like an iPod from the outside, inside, it’s got a Raspberry Pi loaded with software custom-built by Dupont to interface with Spotify, while still keeping the classic iPod style. He calls it the sPot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y7175"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxdhG1OhVng"&gt;In a video&lt;/a&gt; showing off the project and the process behind it, Dupont says he was inspired when his mother-in-law gifted him the old iPod. In a Hackaday post, he says he “had forgotten how good it feels to hold and use one of these things,” but he wanted to update it with some modern features, including (obviously) Spotify streaming, Bluetooth audio, and search. That’s right, the device can search the entirety of Spotify’s library and stream it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyFW7-qaIEFCta6y5s_r9cj4UG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273865/2933361611439284872.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don’t need an iTunes library where we’re going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2VdATS"&gt;Dupont put a Raspberry Pi Zero W inside the iPod because Spotify requires an internet connection — something most iPods don’t support. It also allows for the custom interface and Bluetooth audio. The sPot also needs a larger battery to power the Pi, but all of the hardware still fits inside the original iPod case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T72aeRI-CMGagutYMdzweASWZXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273841/9709381611420439726.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPod on the outside...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zvjb6mT4-eM7h5hzKIb-u3foW-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273833/461361611420741157.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...all custom on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gw7DaV"&gt;Dupont was able to keep the scroll wheel interface — and he even managed to improve it. There’s now haptic feedback when scrolling, instead of just the audible click. But while many of the original buttons are present, they haven't all been as faithfully preserved as the click wheel has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSir5i"&gt;The hold switch now controls the power, instead of locking the iPod to prevent pocket-scrolling. And while the headphone jack is still there, it no longer does anything (RIP to a real one), as audio output is handled by Bluetooth. It also ditches the original 30-pin connector for an easier-to-find-in-2021 Micro USB port that handles charging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFbXrN7X-i1h8z8a2EyMJhvDLCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273871/Screen_Shot_2021_02_01_at_11.22.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphone jack is now just for decoration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gif of Dupont using the scroll wheel to navigate his custom interface" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbSQMYwkFGknK6wEyXtEKNzhInk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273830/2384981611437343326.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Guy Dupont&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That beautiful scroll wheel action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zKddII"&gt;If you wanted to make one of these yourself, Dupont has &lt;a href="https://github.com/dupontgu/retro-ipod-spotify-client"&gt;posted all of the code you’ll need on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. He also &lt;a href="https://hackaday.io/project/177034-spot-spotify-in-a-4th-gen-ipod-2004"&gt;created a Hackaday page&lt;/a&gt; detailing the other software that’s needed to get Spotify working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pa3ExI"&gt;If you’re like me and are wishing for your own sPot, the video should give you pretty much all you need to get started. Doing the quickest of searches for the parts he’s listed, the project will cost around $100, plus the price of the iPod if you don’t already have one. But even if you have no desire to make one of these, the video is totally worth a watch just to experience the glory of what a modern iPod could look like and to see this really cool project come together. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus is getting a Wakanda show from the director of Black Panther</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tpEwkrWubWu2pUophQ-rHBaLyfw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753255/BlackPanther596d2f166e594_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt Kennedy / Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MHzoAh"&gt;Writer-director Ryan Coogler is making a new Marvel TV show for Disney Plus that will be set in the Kingdom of Wakanda as part of a five-year TV exclusivity deal with Coogler’s production banner, Proximity Media (which includes principals Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian, Ludwig Göransson, Archie Davis, and Peter Nicks alongside Coogler himself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKE9nl"&gt;Coogler — who directed and co-wrote Black Panther, and is set to write and direct a sequel &lt;em&gt;Black Panther II&lt;/em&gt; for release on July 8th, 2022 — will develop the new Wakanda Disney Plus series as his first project under the new deal, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/black-panther-ryan-coogler-wakanda-series-disney-plus-exclusive-disney-television-deal-proximity-media-1234684707/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaH3Ca"&gt;The deal with Proximity Media also includes the option to create shows for other parts of the Disney banner, not just Marvel Studios. According to Coogler, “We’re already in the mix on some projects that we can’t wait to share.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CtjIXL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wakanda is heading to Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jcFTFx"&gt;There’s little information on the new Wakanda show itself, but presumably the show will continue to build on the foundation that Coogler has set with both Black Panther and the upcoming sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3lCzC"&gt;Whenever it does arrive, though, Coogler’s Wakanda series will mark the latest in an almost dizzying number of TV shows that are planned for Disney Plus. The streaming service has already kicked off its run of Marvel Studios shows with &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, which is currently airing. It’ll be followed shortly after by &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Solider&lt;/em&gt; in March, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; in May, along with &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, and the animated &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wy4Yl0"&gt;Other already announced shows include &lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; She-Hulk, The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ironheart&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Armor Wars&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; I Am Groot&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;all of which are slated to arrive on Disney Plus in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sens. Booker, Schumer, and Wyden will advance cannabis legislation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cannabis (wikimedia)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OzoGT7r04F1Bcy4mANwH63ZwdDw=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68753142/weed.1419980197.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rDQPPs"&gt;Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) issued a joint statement Monday saying they would work together to advance comprehensive cannabis reform legislation in the current Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWSCN1"&gt;“The War on Drugs has been a war on people—particularly people of color. Ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war and end decades of harm inflicted on communities of color across the country. But that alone is not enough,” they said. “As states continue to legalize marijuana, we must also enact measures that will lift up people who were unfairly targeted in the War on Drugs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyQaG4"&gt;All three senators have previously supported legislation to decriminalize cannabis in some form. Schumer &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marijuana%20Freedom%20and%20Opportunity%20Act.pdf"&gt;co-sponsored legislation to decriminalize cannabis&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 &lt;a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/"&gt;and said in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; that he was working on a new federal marijuana legalization bill that would let states decide what to do and would take tax revenues from marijuana and put them toward investing in minority communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIpi08"&gt;“We are committed to working together to put forward and advance comprehensive cannabis reform legislation that will not only turn the page on this sad chapter in American history, but also undo the devastating consequences of these discriminatory policies,” the statement from the three senators reads. “The Senate will make consideration of these reforms a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqu0Wu"&gt;It’s still not totally clear whether President Biden has prioritized marijuana reform, while he was once a leader in the War on Drugs of the 1980s and ’90s, he said during his presidential campaign that he would support rescheduling cannabis to make it legal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jvx4d1"&gt;During the last Congress, the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/04/house-poised-to-vote-to-decriminalize-marijuana/"&gt;passed the MORE Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would have legalized marijuana and expunged the criminal records of people convicted of marijuana-related crimes. The legislation died in the Republican-controlled Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="06CYHA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Will Democrats keep their promise to decriminalize marijuana?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X4L6sj"&gt;Wyden, who is now chairman of the Senate finance committee, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/senate-democrats-marijuana-legislation-456074"&gt;said in November&lt;/a&gt; that he had a bill ready to go called the Marijuana Revenue and Regulation Act, which outlines a taxation and regulation structure for marijuana products.  And Booker &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/cory-booker-introduces-bill-to-legalize-marijuana-nationwide.html"&gt;introduced a bill in 2019&lt;/a&gt; — the Marijuana Justice Act — to legalize marijuana on a national level, with a focus on expunging federal convictions for marijuana use and possession and reinvesting in communities hardest hit by the War on Drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keu6gs"&gt;“In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations,” the three senators said. “Getting input from stakeholder groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ni0n3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 1st 4:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added detail about the MORE Act and Sen. Booker’s legislation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is shutting down its in-house Stadia game development studios</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tZ5Se9"&gt;Google is shutting down its internal Stadia game development division, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;, as it refocuses Stadia to be a home for streaming games from existing developers instead of developing its own games for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGaMnI"&gt;“Creating best-in-class games from the ground up takes many years and significant investment, and the cost is going up exponentially,” reads a blog post from Phil Harrison, a vice president at Google and general manager for Stadia. “Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&amp;amp;E, beyond any near-term planned games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39OJnZ"&gt;As part of that change, the company is shutting down both its Los Angeles and Montreal game studios, both of which existed under the Stadia Games and Entertainment banner. Google says that “most of the SG&amp;amp;E [Stadia Games and Entertainment] team will be moving on to new roles,” but Jade Raymond — the Ubisoft and EA industry veteran that led the Stadia studio teams — will be departing the company entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9hDi3W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google created its own studio for Stadia-exclusive games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019"},{"title":"Google says it’s planning to build multiple first-party game studios for Stadia exclusives","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931295/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-first-party-studios-jade-raymond-interview-exclusive-games"},{"title":"Google poaches God of War studio head to run new Stadia game team","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164801/google-stadia-shannon-studstill-playa-vista-studio-sony-santa-monica-god-of-war"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="po7jAg"&gt;Stadia itself, alongside the $9.99 Stadia Pro subscription service, will continue to exist going forward, and Google may continue trying to secure exclusive (or timed-exclusive) third-party titles to offer through its subscription. Any “near-planned” games will still be released on Stadia, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UxTIb"&gt;But the shuttering of Stadia’s in-house studios marks a serious blow to Google’s gaming ambitions. Beyond the mere technical aspects of the streaming service itself, the fact that Google was willing to invest in multiple first-party studios was one of the most significant parts of the original Stadia vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v48jle"&gt;That Google would be creating games for the fledgling streaming service — titles that in theory would take advantage of its unique cloud technology — marked how seriously Google was investing in Stadia. It was also a sign that the company aspired to one day introduce exclusives that could offer compelling competition to companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, all of which rely heavily on their own in-house studios to create key exclusive games to drive players to their services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QryOmt"&gt;The fact that Stadia will no longer be in the game-making business makes a certain amount of sense: developing a AAA-title is an incredibly expensive endeavor. But it also means that Stadia’s future will likely be relegated to just another option where you can play the same games as you can already play on a PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YC67R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus will soon let you cast workouts to a smart TV using AirPlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDpy89xOjXeCMZCaS-pAHgnAd_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68752687/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UNsj9"&gt;Apple’s latest watchOS 7 and iOS 14 beta releases indicate a new casting feature for Apple Fitness Plus subscribers is on the way, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/apple-fitness-is-adding-airplay-casting/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPUfEv"&gt;The upcoming software updates will allow AirPlay casting of Fitness Plus workouts to compatible smart TVs, which include any with AirPlay 2 compatibility. That’s good news for Fitness Plus users who may not own an Apple TV, which was previously the only way to get an audio or video workout playing on a bigger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgoL0T"&gt;Fitness Plus was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437578/apple-fitness-plus-classes-subscription-health"&gt;announced in September of last year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;launched in December&lt;/a&gt;, and the paid service costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year for access to guided workouts. The service requires at minimum an Apple Watch Series 3 and a paired iPhone 6S or newer, both running the most up-to-date iOS 14 software releases. At launch, the only way to stream a workout from your TV was to have an Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHovFh"&gt;Now, with the watchOS and iOS releases on the horizon, Fitness Plus users need only an Airplay 2-compatible set. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260722%2Fapple-fitness-plus-airplay-workouts-tv-new-feature-ios-14-5#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of available TVs that meet the requirements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 will support PS5 DualSense and Xbox Series X controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QrD1EwouzyAN9nxf6IRc-Owc1sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68752376/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BDAf6V"&gt;Apple is releasing its iOS 14.5 update to beta testers today, and one of the welcome changes is support for the new PS5 DualSense and Xbox Series X controllers. Neither of these new controllers is currently supported in the latest versions of iOS and iPadOS, but 14.5 introduces support for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGnCAI"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS 14.5 update follows the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21580245/microsoft-apple-xbox-series-x-controller-support-iphone-ipad-ios-ipados"&gt;revealing back in November&lt;/a&gt; that it was working with Microsoft to include support for the Xbox Series X controllers. Steam also added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591013/steam-input-api-ps5-dualsense-controller-support"&gt;PS5 controller support&lt;/a&gt; last year, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240383/nvidia-shield-tv-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support-update"&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV support last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95bPrv"&gt;iOS 14.5 will also include the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;unlock an iPhone with an Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; while wearing a mask, Siri emergency contact calling, CarPlay ETA sharing, and dual-SIM 5G support. Apple hasn’t said exactly when iOS 14.5 will arrive to all devices, but given it’s entered into beta today, it should arrive for everyone in the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 tries to solve Face ID’s mask problem with your Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A new Apple Watch watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g9_FEWRpWJUCVFO-ueA4mQM50o0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68752372/vpavic_200929_4216_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lyYwq"&gt;Apple’s latest iPhones stuck with Face ID as the singular method of biometric authentication  in an era when people are wearing face masks everywhere they go. This inevitably means having to enter your passcode &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; throughout the day. But Apple has come up with a stopgap solution that should make it easier to get into your phone during mask life — as long as you’ve got an Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI7AfK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/apple/155559-iphone-face-id-will-soon-work-with-masks-but-only-if-you-re-wearing-an-apple-watch"&gt;As first reported by &lt;em&gt;Pocket-lint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new iOS 14.5 update, which went into beta today, uses the Apple Watch on your wrist to quickly authenticate and unlock your iPhone. Apple already offers this convenient trick on the Mac, but now it’s coming to the iPhone as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxEuqC"&gt;It works similarly here. You lift your iPhone to turn on the screen, and you’ll feel a little nudge of haptic feedback on your Apple Watch to indicate that your iPhone has been unlocked. The devices must be in close proximity for this to work in the first place, which is a measure to keep your data secure. (If the Apple Watch is locked, this won’t work either.) And this Apple Watch shortcut is only good for unlocking your iPhone; App Store and iTunes purchases will still require other authentication if your face is covered. And as a final security check, you’ll still be asked to put in your passcode every few hours even when unlock with Apple Watch is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD95ik"&gt;This feature hasn’t always been so reliable for some Mac owners, so it’ll take some testing to see whether Apple has made it more seamless on the iPhone, which people unlock a whole lot throughout the day. Android has offered a similar benefit for some time now via the “smart lock” setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2we7Rl"&gt;It’s been rumored (most recently by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-in-the-next-iphone-check-samsungs-new-galaxy-s21-11611931084"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that Apple is considering moving to an in-screen fingerprint reader to complement Face ID for the iPhone 13. The latest iPad Air also features a Touch ID fingerprint sensor within the power button, so Apple certainly has options for giving users more choice in future iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJ5yPH"&gt;iOS 14.5 also includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;app tracking transparency controls (and permission pop-ups)&lt;/a&gt; that companies like Facebook aren’t happy about. It adds support for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 controllers, brings 5G dual-sim functionality to users globally, and also offers some Siri enhancements like the ability to call emergency contacts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego made a white noise playlist, and it takes me back to being a kid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56TLXM5Snf503GrFV3fJFtjns60=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68752210/Lego_Zen_Spring_3_Dec_2020___0762.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhsrgS"&gt;Lego &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-lt%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2021%2Ffebruary%2Fwhite-noise&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260423%2Flego-white-noise-playlist-spotify-apple-music#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made a white noise playlist&lt;/a&gt; featuring Lego bricks, and it’s surprisingly relaxing. I don’t get many opportunities to build Lego sets anymore, but I’ve been listening to the playlist while writing this story, and it’s taking me back to the hours I spent as a kid building elaborately designed spaceships with an ever-increasing number of wings and laser guns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWGqKs"&gt;The playlist has seven different tracks, each about 30 minutes long. Some sound like you’re sitting next to somebody shuffling through a pile of bricks while working on a build. I’m a big fan of “Searching for the One (Brick)” because it captures the feeling of digging through a pile of bricks and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; finding that one piece you were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHIHZp"&gt;Other tracks use Lego bricks to make some really cool soundscapes. One, “Wild as the Wind,” uses Lego bricks to convincingly emulate the sound of trees rustling in the breeze. Another, “The Waterfall,” sounds as if you were pouring out a gigantic box of bricks for 30 minutes straight. And one track, “It All Clicks,” features bricks being snapped together, creating a popcorn rhythm of satisfying clicks in your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFGCs5"&gt;You can find the playlist on more than 15 streaming platforms, including &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6qZUya0mkucuxvoIp4akVT"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fgb%2Falbum%2Flego-white-noise%2F1548466310&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260423%2Flego-white-noise-playlist-spotify-apple-music#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
